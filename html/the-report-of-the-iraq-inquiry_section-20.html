<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the roles and responsibilities of key individuals and bodies; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the machinery established in order to make decisions pre-conflict, and </p>
<p>post-conflict.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the decision to join the US-led invasion of </p>
<p>Iraq, which can be read in Section 7.</p>
<p><b>Roles and responsibilities</b></p>
<p><b>Cabinet</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> Under UK constitutional conventions – in which the Prime Minister leads the </p>
<p>Government but is not personally vested with the powers of a Head of State – Cabinet </p>
<p>is the main mechanism by which senior members of the Government take collective </p>
<p>responsibility for decisions that are of critical importance to the public. The decision to </p>
<p>deploy UK Armed Forces to Iraq clearly falls into that category.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Cabinet is formally a Committee of the Privy Council, chaired by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> In 2003, the <i>Ministerial Code</i> said:</p>
<p>“The Cabinet is supported by Ministerial Committees (both standing and ad hoc) </p>
<p>which have a two-fold purpose. First, they relieve the pressure on the Cabinet </p>
<p>itself by settling as much business as possible at a lower level or, failing that, by </p>
<p>clarifying the issues and defining the points of disagreement. Second, they support </p>
<p>the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though an important </p>
<p>question may never reach the Cabinet itself, the decision will be fully considered and </p>
<p>the final judgement will be sufficiently authoritative to ensure that the Government as </p>
<p>a whole can properly be expected to accept responsibility for it.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The <i>Code</i> also said:</p>
<p>“The business of the Cabinet and Ministerial Committees consists in the main of:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>questions which significantly engage the collective responsibility of the </p>
<p>Government because they raise major issues or policy or because they are </p>
<p>of critical importance to the public;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>questions on which there is an unresolved argument between Departments.”</p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Cabinet Office, <i>Ministerial Code</i>, July 2001, page 3.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The Prime Minister was and is responsible for the <i>Code</i> and for judging whether </p>
<p>Ministerial behaviour is consistent with its standards.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The <i>Ministerial Code</i> encapsulates the role of Cabinet Committees in identifying, </p>
<p>testing and developing policy options; analysing and mitigating risks; and debating and </p>
<p>honing proposals until they are endorsed across government. Cabinet Committees are </p>
<p>relied on every day to keep the process of policy-making moving.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Although the practice of using Cabinet Committees has been a constant feature </p>
<p>over many decades, the number of Committees, the subjects they consider and </p>
<p>the way in which they are used has evolved, and has varied from Prime Minister to </p>
<p>Prime Minister.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> Discussion in full Cabinet meetings differs from that in Cabinet Committees. Cabinet </p>
<p>would not normally be expected to explore the detailed aspects of a policy.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> In his<i> Statement of Reasons</i> for the exercise of the executive override under </p>
<p>Section 53 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the ‘Ministerial Veto’) to prevent the </p>
<p>disclosure of the minutes of meetings of Cabinet on 13 and 17 March 2003, Mr Jack </p>
<p>Straw, Lord Chancellor from 2007 to 2010, set out the then Government’s perspective </p>
<p>on the functions of Cabinet.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“Serious and controversial decisions must be taken with free, frank – even blunt – </p>
<p>deliberation between colleagues. Dialogue must be fearless. Ministers must </p>
<p>have the confidence to challenge each other in private. They must ensure that </p>
<p>decisions have been properly thought through, sounding out all the possibilities </p>
<p>before committing themselves to a course of action. They must not feel inhibited </p>
<p>from advancing opinions that may be unpopular or controversial. They must not be </p>
<p>deflected from expressing dissent by the fear that they may be held personally to </p>
<p>account for views that are later cast aside.</p>
<p>“Discussions of this nature will not however take place without a private space in </p>
<p>which thoughts can be voiced without fear of reprisal, or publicity. Cabinet provides </p>
<p>this space. If there cannot be frank discussion of the most important matters of </p>
<p>Government policy at Cabinet, it may not occur at all. Cabinet decision taking could </p>
<p>increasingly be drawn into more informal channels, with attendant dangers of lack of </p>
<p>rigour, lack of proper accountability, and lack of proper recording of decisions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The [Information] Tribunal thought that the deployment of troops was a hugely </p>
<p>important step in the nation’s recent history and that Cabinet should be accountable </p>
<p>for it. I also believe that to be the case, but accountability for this decision – as for </p>
<p>any other Cabinet decision – is properly with the Government as a whole and not </p>
<p>with individual Ministers …</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>2  |  Decision-making within government</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>“Collective responsibility requires that Ministers should be able to express </p>
<p>their views frankly in the expectation that they can argue freely in private while </p>
<p>maintaining a united front when decisions have been reached …</p>
<p>“If permitted to demonstrate their degree of attachment to any given policy, </p>
<p>Ministers could absolve themselves from responsibility for decisions that they </p>
<p>have nevertheless agreed to stand by … Thus, every Minister in the 2003 Cabinet </p>
<p>could legitimately be held to account for the decision to use armed force in Iraq. </p>
<p>The resignation of Ministers at the time of this particular decision recognised and </p>
<p>reinforced that principle.</p>
<p>“… The Government is committed to ensuring public participation in its decision </p>
<p>making: it exposes its thinking to Parliament and public via parliamentary debate, </p>
<p>public consultation, and engagement with the media …”</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Mr Straw also described a “decision to commit British Service Personnel to an </p>
<p>armed conflict” as being an “exceptionally serious” issue.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Many of Mr Straw’s points were reiterated by Mr Dominic Grieve, the Attorney </p>
<p>General, when maintaining the veto in 2012.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Geoff Hoon, Defence Secretary from 1999 to 2005, told the Inquiry that he had:</p>
<p>“… always seen the position of any Secretary of State as being in a sense the </p>
<p>department’s voice in the Cabinet, but equally, the Cabinet’s voice in the department. </p>
<p>So it is a two-way process …”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>Role of the Civil Service</b></p>
<p>THE CABINET SECRETARY</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The Cabinet Secretary is the most senior civil servant providing policy advice to the </p>
<p>Prime Minister.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> There is no fixed set of functions attached to the role. Priorities and objectives for </p>
<p>each appointee are set by the Prime Minister of the day.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Certain responsibilities sit by convention and long practice with the Cabinet </p>
<p>Secretary:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>overall responsibility for security and intelligence systems and structures </p>
<p>(in 2003, day-to-day responsibility was delegated to Sir David Omand by </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull);</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>responsibility for the machinery of Government (including the division of </p>
<p>departmental responsibilities and the Cabinet Committee structure); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the organisation and recording of Cabinet meetings.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Particularly in relation to the latter two responsibilities, the Cabinet Secretary has a </p>
<p>dual responsibility to the Prime Minister and to Cabinet collectively, and to both former </p>
<p>and future governments.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> In 2009, three former Cabinet Secretaries</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> told the House of Lords Select </p>
<p>Committee on the Constitution:</p>
<p>“… each of us, as Secretary of the Cabinet, has been constantly conscious of </p>
<p>his responsibility to the Cabinet collectively and of the need to have regard to the </p>
<p>needs and responsibilities of the other members of the Cabinet (and indeed of other </p>
<p>Ministers) as well of those of the Prime Minister. That has coloured our relationships </p>
<p>with Number 10 as well as those with other Ministers and their departments.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>21. </b> During Sir Andrew Turnbull’s tenure, the Cabinet Secretary was Head of the Home </p>
<p>Civil Service, with leadership of the Civil Service as a whole. This role placed on the </p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary a duty of care for the well-being of civil servants and the responsibility </p>
<p>to be a fair employer.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The Cabinet Secretary has line management responsibility for departmental </p>
<p>Permanent Secretaries across Whitehall.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The first edition of <i>The Cabinet Manual</i>, published in October 2011, ascribes the </p>
<p>following specific responsibilities to the Cabinet Secretary:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Cabinet Secretary is head of the Cabinet Secretariat.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Cabinet Secretary, unless unavoidably absent, attends all meetings of </p>
<p>Cabinet and is responsible for the smooth running of Cabinet meetings and for </p>
<p>preparing records of its discussions and decisions.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Permanent Secretaries are responsible to the Cabinet Secretary or the Head </p>
<p>of the Civil Service for the effective day-to-day management of the relevant </p>
<p>department, or the particular issues for which they are responsible …”</p>

<p>271</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The <i>Manual</i> also describes the Cabinet Secretary’s advisory role:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister decides – with the advice of the Cabinet Secretary – the overall </p>
<p>structure of the Cabinet committee system, including … the terms of reference of </p>
<p>each Cabinet committee.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>25. </b> The <i>Manual</i>, according to Sir Gus O’Donnell’s preface, records “the current position </p>
<p>rather than driving change”. It is quoted here on that basis.</p>
<p>PERMANENT SECRETARIES</p>
<p><b>26. </b> The Permanent Secretary (referred to in some departments as the Permanent </p>
<p>Under Secretary or PUS) is the most senior civil servant within a government </p>
<p>department. He or she is appointed Accounting Officer (AO) for that department.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The <i>Ministerial Code</i> explained that an AO takes personal responsibility for </p>
<p>the propriety and regularity of public finances, for keeping proper accounts, for the </p>
<p>avoidance of waste and extravagance and for the efficient and effective use of the </p>
<p>resources for which they are responsible.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>28. </b> In addition:</p>
<p>“Accounting Officers have a particular responsibility to see that appropriate advice </p>
<p>is tendered to Ministers on all matters of financial propriety and regularity and more </p>
<p>broadly as to all considerations of prudent and economical administration, efficiency </p>
<p>and effectiveness and value for money.”</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The PUS of the FCO is also designated Head of the Diplomatic Service.</p>
<p>NO.10 CHIEF OF STAFF</p>
<p><b>30. </b> In 1997, Mr Jonathan Powell was appointed as the first Chief of Staff in No.10.  </p>
<p>This was a new role for a political appointee.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Powell wrote:</p>
<p>“Robin [Butler, the Cabinet Secretary] told us we needed a special Order in Council </p>
<p>to allow Alastair [Campbell] and me to tell civil servants what to do. He thought </p>
<p>perhaps Tony would want another similar political appointee so he suggested we </p>
<p>allow for three positions with special powers.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>32. </b> That proposal became the Civil Service (Amendment) Order 1997 which exempted </p>
<p>“up to three situations in the Prime Minister’s Office which are designated by him” from </p>
<p>the principle of selection on merit based on a fair and open competition, allowing political </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>appointees to hold central executive roles.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> The Order was revoked by Mr Gordon </p>
<p>Brown when he took office in June 2007.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Powell described his role to the Inquiry as “to bring together the foreign and </p>
<p>domestic, the political and the Civil Service, the press and the policy bits of Number </p>
<p>10.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p>“It was my job to make sure that Number 10 was co-ordinated to make sure that </p>
<p>those things [provision of support and advice to the Prime Minister and government] </p>
<p>were happening … I followed the Prime Minister’s priorities, so I would shift from </p>
<p>subject to subject …”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>34. </b> In relation to Iraq, Mr Powell said that he operated more in a “link role”, ensuring that </p>
<p>Mr Blair was kept up to date and that his decisions were communicated rapidly.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>35. </b> In his book <i>The New Machiavelli</i> Mr Powell wrote:</p>
<p>“The most important task of a chief of staff is saying ‘no’. Politicians always like to </p>
<p>say ‘yes’, and it is important they continue doing so if they are to remain popular. </p>
<p>But it is not possible to see everyone who asks for a meeting, nor to attend every </p>
<p>event… so someone needs to refuse and take the flak for doing so. Likewise, not all </p>
<p>advice should be accepted and someone has to send it back asking for more work </p>
<p>or even rejecting it.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Mr Blair said of Mr Powell: “his main contributions to the office were a knowledge of </p>
<p>the Civil Service system, an extraordinary work rate… and a politics that was completely </p>
<p>and naturally New Labour”.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>THE SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE CO-ORDINATOR</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Commenting on the decision to create the post of Security and Intelligence </p>
<p>Co-ordinator, the Butler Review reported that it had been “represented to us </p>
<p>that this change had been particularly necessary after the terrorist attacks of </p>
<p>11 September 2001”.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The Butler Review commented that the effect of creating the post was:</p>
<p>“… that the Cabinet Secretary is no longer so directly involved in the chain through </p>
<p>which intelligence reaches the Prime Minister. It follows that the Cabinet Secretary, </p>
<p>who attends the Cabinet and maintains the machinery to support their decision-</p>
<p>making is less directly involved personally in advising the Prime Minister on security </p>

<p>and intelligence issues … the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator does not attend </p>
<p>Cabinet and is not part of the Cabinet Secretariat supporting Cabinet Ministers in </p>
<p>discharging their collective responsibilities in defence and overseas policy matters. </p>
<p>We understand that the Intelligence and Security Committee will shortly review how </p>
<p>this arrangement has worked.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>39. </b> Asked about his dual role in relation to the Chairman of the JIC, Sir David Omand </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that the Butler Report had commented that “as a result” of his </p>
<p>appointment, the “Cabinet Secretary is no longer so directly involved in the chain </p>
<p>through which intelligence reaches the Prime Minister” but that: “It wouldn’t be correct </p>
<p>to assume that any Cabinet Secretary had been in the loop in the provision of advice on </p>
<p>assessed intelligence.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> That had always been “a duty that had fallen on the Chairman </p>
<p>of the JIC”. Sir David told the Inquiry that a condition of appointment had been that he </p>
<p>“would not interpose his judgement on the content of the intelligence”.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Sir David told the Inquiry that his role in relation to the intelligence community was </p>
<p>to “make sure it was in good health, argue for its resources and negotiate those with </p>
<p>the Treasury, ensure that the Agencies were working together, try to generate some </p>
<p>efficiencies and be on the look out … for new ways in which the community could be </p>
<p>made more effective”.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>Departmental roles</b></p>
<p><b>The Cabinet Office</b></p>
<p><b>41. </b> The Cabinet Office contains the Cabinet Secretariats, which support the Cabinet </p>
<p>and Cabinet Committees, and draw staff from across government.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> In the period from </p>
<p>2001 to 2003, the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec)</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> was responsible for </p>
<p>foreign and defence policy issues, including Iraq.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>42. </b> In 2001 and 2002, of about a dozen staff in OD Sec, only two covered Iraq.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> In both </p>
<p>cases, Iraq was one part of their job.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Sir David Manning became Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of OD Sec in </p>
<p>September 2001. That marked a change from previous arrangements, in which the two </p>
<p>roles had been held by two different individuals.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Lord Wilson of Dinton, Cabinet Secretary from 1998 to 2002, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>the appointment of Advisers and their role as Heads of the relevant Secretariats in the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office had reflected Mr Blair’s desire to have his senior people around him: </p>
<p>“He had his own team. That is, to be honest, how he liked to work.”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Lord Wilson said </p>
<p>that he had been against the change.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The Butler Review commented that the effect of the decision to combine “two key </p>
<p>posts at the top of the Cabinet Secretariat” (the Heads of the Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>and of the European Secretariats), with the posts of the Prime Minister’s Advisers on </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs and on European Affairs, had been to: “weight their responsibility to the </p>
<p>Prime Minister more heavily than their responsibility through the Cabinet Secretary to </p>
<p>the Cabinet as a whole”.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>46. </b> The Butler Review acknowledged that the “view of the present post-holders is </p>
<p>that the arrangement works well, in particular in connecting the work of the Cabinet </p>
<p>Secretariat to that of the Prime Minister’s office”. It also recorded that “it was clear </p>
<p>from the departmental policy papers it had seen that there was very close co-operation </p>
<p>between officials in the Prime Minister’s office and in the FCO in policy making on Iraq”. </p>
<p>The Review commented: “It is nonetheless a shift which acts to concentrate detailed </p>

<p><b>47. </b> The Butler Review concluded that the changes to the key posts at the head of the </p>

<p>the Secretariat, then over a period of time it is likely that there will be an implicit </p>
<p>assumption that the Cabinet Secretary’s interests are being represented… so you </p>
<p>don’t really need to invite the Cabinet Secretary to the meeting.”</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Asked whether that had affected decision-making on Iraq, Sir David Omand </p>
<p>responded that:</p>
<p>“I think the Cabinet Secretary was not as present as previous Cabinet Secretaries … </p>
<p>would have been. Of course one of the reasons for that is that the Prime Minister </p>
<p>had given the Cabinet Secretary a very different agenda … the new Cabinet </p>
<p>Secretary was chosen explicitly on that basis.”</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Sir David agreed that the Cabinet Secretary could have “made a fuss” about that:</p>
<p>“But it would have been at the direct expense of not being able to devote the time </p>
<p>to sorting out reform and delivery across the government’s agenda.”</p>
<p> 29</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Describing the resource constraints in the Cabinet Office, Sir David Omand told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that he had “inherited an overspend where there wasn’t enough money to pay </p>
<p>for all” the units in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, which were “funded from the </p>
<p>same vote”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> The Treasury had kept them, he expected “deliberately”, on a “very tight </p>
<p>leash in order to restrain the growth of Downing Street”. Sir David had found it “quite </p>
<p>hard” to staff the Cabinet Office at the level he would have wanted and it had been </p>
<p>necessary to prioritise.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> In relation to Iraq, Sir David said:</p>
<p>“We did find money for OD Secretariat to expand… at the time of Iraq. We did find </p>
<p>money to enable the Joint Intelligence Committee’s assessment staff to work at full </p>
<p>tilt as the crisis – the run up to the campaign – developed.</p>
<p>“But it was a bit of a struggle and not necessarily ideal. It was also the case that </p>
<p>the Overseas and Defence Secretariat, who were hard pressed on Iraq, were also </p>
<p>valiantly providing me the sole support I had to work on a counter-terrorism strategy. </p>
<p>I have nothing but praise for them. They did a fantastic job, but it was a stretch.”</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Sir David added:</p>
<p>“In a sense, one of the lessons … is that you can’t enter into a run-up to a major </p>
<p>conflict and continue with business as usual. There was a certain sense that the </p>
<p>government was trying to do everything as well as manage this very major military </p>
<p>operation – I don’t think that’s possible.</p>

<p>… for that period that dominated the work of that group of Ministers. They delegated </p>
<p>everything else. That didn’t happen… on Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Sir David Manning recognised that the teams working on Iraq were small and </p>
<p>heavily loaded, and that fatigue was a factor, but told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I did not feel that, at official level, we were unable to manage the decision making </p>

<p><b>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office</b></p>

<p>32</p>
<p> They included:</p>

<p>“co-ordination and leadership of the UK’s international policies”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“expert foreign policy advice for Ministers and the Prime Minister, feeding into </p>

<p>“rapid gathering, analysis and targeting of information for the Government and </p>
<p>others”.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> In the period from 2001 to 2003, prime responsibility within the FCO for information </p>
<p>on other countries fell to the relevant regional department. For Iraq, that was the </p>
<p>Middle East Department (MED), under the supervision of the Director, Middle East </p>
<p>and North Africa.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> The FCO Political Director, later known as the Director General (Political), is the </p>

<p>policy advice to Ministers on those issues.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The Political Director is a member of the FCO Board and reports to the PUS.</p>

<p>of attention over the next months. It discussed contingency plans being put in place. </p>
<p>Work was in hand on staffing and establishing emergency units [see Section 6.5]. </p>
<p>Procedures were due to be tested in January … Board members stressed the need </p>

<p>that he held daily meetings at 0900 to co-ordinate FCO activity, chaired in his absence </p>
<p>by another FCO Board member or Mr Edward Chaplin (FCO Director, Middle East and </p>
<p>North Africa). He also described the Iraq-related responsibilities of FCO senior officials:</p>

<p>involved a wide spread of senior managers, because we may well have to sustain </p>
<p>an intense crisis for a significant period …</p>

<p>I propose to take responsibility under you as overall co-ordinator …</p>
<p>“MED and Personnel Command discussed again this week the staff numbers </p>

<p><b>The Secret Intelligence Service and C</b></p>
<p><b>66. </b> The 1994 Intelligence Services Act placed the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) on </p>
<p>a statutory basis, giving the Foreign Secretary responsibility for the work of SIS, defining </p>
<p>the functions of the Service and the responsibilities of its Chief, who is known as C.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>67. </b> The principal role of SIS is the production of secret intelligence on issues concerning </p>
<p>Britain’s vital interests in the fields of security, defence, foreign and economic policies </p>
<p>in accordance with requirements established by the Joint Intelligence Committee </p>
<p>(JIC) and approved by Ministers. SIS uses human and technical sources to meet </p>
<p>those requirements, as well as liaison with a wide range of foreign intelligence and </p>
<p>security services.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>68. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the Service is not the Foreign Office. It’s not a policy department. It’s a </p>
<p>department which is essentially an operational department, which contains a </p>
<p>lot of people with some really remarkable knowledge and expertise.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Under Section 2 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994, the Chief is responsible for </p>
<p>the efficiency of the Service and it is:</p>
<p>“… his duty to ensure –</p>

<p>that there are arrangements for securing that no information is obtained </p>

<p>on any matter relating to its work”.</p>
<p>42</p>

<p><b>72. </b> Intelligence collected by the three Intelligence Agencies – SIS, the Security Service </p>

<p>and the Intelligence Agencies.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> Sir Richard Dearlove, Chief of SIS, travelled with </p>
<p>Mr Blair and had, in Lord Wilson’s words: “seized his chance, quite understandably, </p>
<p>and got to know the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister got to know him”.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Asked about the pressures on SIS as a result of their success in producing material </p>
<p>for the dossier, and when Mr Blair was relying on them and had put them on a pedestal, </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry that was:</p>
<p>“… a fragile and dangerous position, as one was well aware at the time. I don’t deny </p>
<p>that. But such are the events of government sometimes.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Asked about his joint visits to Washington with Sir Richard Dearlove, Sir David </p>
<p>Manning told the Inquiry that they “probably reflected the new weight that the intelligence </p>

<p>“It’s in a sense inevitable because the Americans chose to play it this way. [George] </p>

<p><b>76. </b> Sir David also commented that:</p>
<p>“… after 9/11 you see a completely new emphasis in Whitehall from Ministers, and </p>
<p>indeed in terms of budgetary provision, for the Agencies. The fact that they had </p>
<p>become the natural interlocutors of key players in the Bush Administration, and … </p>
<p>given … much higher priority for resourcing … reflect[ed] a sort of shift in weight in </p>
<p>the system.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Asked whether Sir Richard Dearlove spent more time with Mr Blair than his </p>
<p>predecessors, Sir David commented that he did not know; but:</p>
<p>“Richard was certainly part of the group the Prime Minister consulted regularly, </p>
<p>and … had access to the Prime Minister … pretty much when he wanted it.”</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Asked for his observations on how the relationships between the intelligence </p>
<p>services, in particular Sir Richard Dearlove, and Mr Blair, Mr Straw and himself had </p>
<p>changed, Sir David told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… because the whole terrorism issue moved so rapidly up the agenda, and </p>
<p>because there is a sense that we are vulnerable to asymmetric threats in a way </p>
<p>that we haven’t been in the past, there is a new recognition of the importance of the </p>
<p>Agencies, a new willingness among Ministers to fund and resource the Agencies, </p>
<p>and a much greater dependence on advice from the Agencies on threats that are not </p>
<p>the conventional threats that we have been used to.</p>
<p>“… in addition … you have two rather remarkable personalities as the Heads of </p>
<p>[their respective] Agencies, Richard [Dearlove] and Eliza [Manningham-Buller] </p>
<p>… and if you find that the American system is using the Agencies really rather </p>
<p>extensively, then it does change the pattern and the way we work, partly because </p>
<p>the Government puts much more emphasis on the Agencies and much less, in my </p>
<p>view – and I think it’s a mistake – on the traditional departments, but partly because </p>
<p>we don’t have a lot of choice because this is the sort of network that’s developing.</p>
<p>“… in a way I think you have to accept that the Heads of the Agencies are much </p>
<p>more like the traditional Permanent Under Secretaries, that their departments are </p>
<p>frequently better funded to deal with these issues than the traditional departments </p>
<p>are, have more resource, can act more quickly …</p>
<p>“So I think there has been a shift in the way that Whitehall operates, and I think it </p>
<p>is inevitable that, as a result of that shift, the Heads of the Agencies have greater </p>
<p>weight in the system …”</p>

<p><b>79. </b> Sir David added that when, in crises, time was very short, there was a “tendency”, </p>
<p>if a message was being passed through an Agency, for that Agency to deliver it.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Asked if the Agencies were being drawn into giving policy advice without necessarily </p>
<p>having the experience fully to occupy that role, Sir David responded that they did </p>
<p>“give more policy advice than in the past”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> Because of the way the process had </p>
<p>changed they had “found themselves almost being sucked into giving that advice </p>
<p>from time to time”. They had found themselves more in a “policy influencing role, </p>
<p>than was traditional”.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Asked for the perspective from No.10 on whether SIS had oversold what it could </p>
<p>deliver, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry: “I can only say, looking back … that the fact </p>
<p>was the intelligence does feel as though it delivered more than it actually did. I think </p>
<p>quite quickly after the invasion it became clear that some of them felt that too.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>82. </b> In relation to Sir Richard Dearlove’s role, Sir David Omand said that:</p>
<p>“SIS were very much in the inner council. They had proved their worth to the Prime </p>
<p>Minister in a number of really very, very valuable pieces of work, not just delivering </p>
<p>intelligence, but … conducting back channel diplomacy, and that, I’m sure weighed </p>
<p>heavily on the Prime Minister’s calculation that, ‘These are people I should be </p>
<p>listening to.’</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… it is quite tempting to comment if you are the confidant of the Prime Minister – </p>
<p>and you can go back to Churchill and his intelligence advisers … to find this in the </p>
<p>role of the then Chief of the SIS in Churchill’s inner council. It is quite tempting to go </p>
<p>over that line and start expressing an opinion on the policy itself. I wasn’t there to </p>
<p>know if that happened … I’m making a more general point.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Sir David added:</p>
<p>“I think there were certainly people in the intelligence community, and there are still </p>
<p>some, who believe that something will turn up in Syria, and I am certainly not going </p>
<p>to break my own rules and say categorically that won’t happen. We could all still be </p>
<p>surprised. But there was a sense in which, because of past successes – very, very </p>
<p>considerable successes supporting this government, that SIS overpromised and </p>
<p>underdelivered, and when that became clear that the intelligence was very hard to </p>
<p>find … they really were having to bust a gut to generate the intelligence.</p>
<p>“I think the Butler Committee really uncovered that the tradecraft at that point </p>
<p>wasn’t as good as it should have been for validation… that’s one of the background </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>100. </b> Lord Boyce, CDS from February 2001 to May 2003, told the Inquiry that his </p>
<p>responsibility was to advise on military capability and capacity.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>101. </b> As the principal military adviser to the Defence Secretary and the Government/</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the CDS will attend Cabinet or its sub-committees as required and will </p>
<p>draw on the operationally focused advice provided by the Service Chiefs of Staff and </p>
<p>senior civil servants through the Chiefs of Staff Committee.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>102. </b> The CDS, advised by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS) and the Service </p>
<p>Chiefs, is responsible for the formulation of the military strategy and its coherence with </p>
<p>government policy. Following the Defence Secretary’s direction, the CDS is responsible </p>
<p>for the planning, direction and conduct of all military operations.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Through a CDS Directive, he:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Appoints the operational commander.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Provides strategic direction.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Identifies the military conditions for success.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Designates the theatre and joint operations area.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Specifies force levels and resources.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Promulgates the constraints on the use of force.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sets the strategic intelligence requirements.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>104. </b> The Chiefs of Staff Committee (COS)<b> </b>is the main forum through which the CDS </p>
<p>seeks and obtains the collective military advice of the single Service Chiefs of Staff, </p>
<p>and through which he discharges his responsibility for the preparation and conduct </p>
<p>of military operations.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>105. </b> The Committee is chaired by the CDS. The three Service Chiefs of Staff and the </p>
<p>VCDS are the only other full members. Responsibility for the decisions and advice that </p>
<p>emerge rests solely with the CDS. More information on COS is set out below.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that it was important that he, the CDS and the PUS </p>
<p>“worked together, otherwise we had problems”:</p>
<p>“… it was important for me to enjoy the confidence of the military, but at the same </p>
<p>time ensure that those responsible for developing policy on the Civil Service side </p>
<p>were comfortable with where we were going.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Hoon added that “one of the great successes” of the MOD was the extent to </p>
<p>which it was “genuinely joined up” and the “real integration between the civil servants </p>

<p>and the military”. He had “excellent relationship[s]” with each of the Chiefs of Defence </p>
<p>Staff with whom he worked, and “very regular … informal and formal meetings”. In </p>
<p>the course of “campaigns like Iraq”, such meetings were “on a daily or more than </p>
<p>daily basis”.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>ROLES WITHIN THE MOD</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The principal task of the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS)</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> was the provision of </p>
<p>intelligence to inform MOD policy formulation and procurement decisions, and to support </p>
<p>military operations.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>109. </b> DIS worked closely with other UK intelligence organisations and with overseas </p>
<p>allies.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> Its sources included human, signals and imagery intelligence, as well as open </p>
<p>sources. The DIS produced a number of reports on the state of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>110. </b> The Defence Crisis Management Organisation (DCMO) is tasked to provide </p>
<p>“politically aware military advice to inform the strategic commitment of UK forces to </p>
<p>overseas joint and combined operations”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>111. </b> The DCMO comprises the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) and elements </p>
<p>of the MOD Central Staff, single service frontline commands and other relevant </p>
<p>departments.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p><b>112. </b> As head of PJHQ, the Chief of Joint Operations (CJO) is responsible for the </p>
<p>planning and execution of joint (tri-Service) operations.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>113. </b> CJO reports directly to the CDS for contingency planning and advice on the </p>
<p>conduct and resourcing of current operations.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> At the operational level, CJO is </p>
<p>responsible for the deployment, direction, sustainment and recovery of deployed forces </p>
<p>in order to deliver the military strategy set out in the CDS’s Directive.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> The CJO is the Commander Joint Operations for current operations for which he </p>
<p>is responsible.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> The MOD Central Staff advises both the PUS and CDS. Between 2001 and 2009 it </p>
<p>was led jointly by the VCDS and the Second Permanent Secretary (2nd PUS),<b> </b>supported </p>
<p>by a joint staff.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>286</p>
<p><b>116. </b> The two most senior members of the Central Staff with responsibilities for decisions </p>
<p>on military operations were the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments) </p>
<p>(DCDS(C)) and the Policy Director. They were supported by the Assistant Chief of </p>
<p>Defence Staff Operations (ACDS(Ops)) and the Director General Operational Policy </p>
<p>(DG Op Pol).</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>117. </b> In the period from 2002 to 2003, DCDS(C) was supported by the Strategic </p>
<p>Planning Group (SPG).</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fry, DCDS(C) from July 2003 to January 2006, </p>
<p>stated that he was “responsible for the military strategic advice to the Chiefs of Staff”.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that the Policy Director was responsible for leading </p>
<p>the effort to balance political and military considerations in producing advice.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>THE CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE</p>
<p><b>120. </b> The Chiefs of Staff Committee is supported by the Chiefs of Staff Secretariat </p>
<p>(COSSEC), which ensures that minutes and decisions are promulgated swiftly, a record </p>
<p>of outstanding actions is prepared and maintained, and papers are prepared and </p>
<p>circulated to support discussions.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> The papers prepared for COS meetings and the minutes of its discussions </p>
<p>(although they are not a verbatim record) provide a major source of information for </p>
<p>the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> From time to time, the Chiefs of Staff also hold discussions which are unminuted. </p>
<p>Those include early discussions on Iraq in the first half of 2002 and Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>(Informal) (COS(I)) meetings.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> By early 2002, the COS Committee was already meeting at least once a week, </p>
<p>often designated as COS (Operations), to discuss operational issues in addition to the </p>
<p>regular cycle of meetings on non-operational issues.</p>
<p><b>124. </b> In 2002, there were 71 meetings of the COS Committee. Issues related to </p>
<p>Afghanistan constituted the main business until 19 September, when COS discussed </p>
<p>a paper addressing potential UK support to US operations against Iraq.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>125. </b> From 19 September, the COS Committee met weekly, usually on a </p>
<p>Wednesday morning, to discuss Iraq, and other operational issues.</p>

<p>287</p>
<p><b>126. </b> The agenda for the weekly COS (Operations) meetings usually comprised a </p>
<p>briefing from the Chief of Defence Intelligence, followed by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“political/military overview”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>operational planning;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>media; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>next steps.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> By the autumn of 2002, COS (Operations) meetings were attended by a range of </p>
<p>military and civilian officials or their representatives.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> In late 2002/early 2003, that included the MOD PUS, the Chief of Defence </p>
<p>Logistics, the DCDS(C), the Chief of Defence Intelligence, the Deputy Chief of Defence </p>
<p>Staff (Equipment Capability), the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel), the </p>
<p>Policy Director, the Director General of Corporate Communications and, frequently, </p>
<p>senior officials from some or all of the Cabinet Office, the FCO, SIS and GCHQ.</p>
<p><b>129. </b> The first recorded attendance by a DFID representative was on 19 February 2003.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Meetings with Defence Ministers often followed COS (Operations) meetings. The </p>
<p>papers examined by the Inquiry for the period between 2001 and 2009 suggest that they </p>
<p>were essentially briefing meetings and no records of the discussions were produced.</p>
<p><b>131. </b> The MOD has conducted an extensive search of its archives and no records of </p>
<p>minutes for these meetings have been located.</p>
<p><b>132. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that attendance at COS meetings provided </p>
<p>“transparency of what the military were doing” for other departments, and that they </p>
<p>would provide inputs setting out their thinking.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit added that it was “a very important way of making sure people </p>
<p>understood the tempo of planning”.</p>
<p><b>134. </b> General Sir John Reith, Chief of Joint Operations from August 2001 to July 2004, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that PJHQ had a “very, very close relationship” with the MOD and in </p>
<p>particular with the Commitments Staff:</p>
<p>“… every single paper that we produced at PJHQ was staffed through the … MOD </p>
<p>before it went under my signature into the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and we had a </p>
<p>VTC [video conference] every morning … I was on regular VTCs for the op[erations] </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff meetings and for the Ministerials.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>The Department for International Development</b></p>
<p><b>135. </b> In 2003, the Department for International Development (DFID) was responsible </p>
<p>for leading the Government’s contribution to eliminating poverty. The International </p>
<p>Development Act, which came into effect in June 2002, had established poverty </p>
<p>reduction as the overarching purpose of British development assistance.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Within DFID, the Iraq Team in the Middle East and North Africa Department </p>
<p>included advisers with expertise on conflict, humanitarian assistance, governance, </p>
<p>infrastructure, economics and social development who provided analysis to inform </p>
<p>decisions.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> The DFID Iraq Team worked closely with the FCO and drew on the FCO’s </p>
<p>Iraq-related research and analysis.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> Advisers were drawn from the relevant DFID professional cadres with consultants </p>
<p>brought in to provide advice on specific issues and projects where required.</p>
<p><b>138. </b> In addition, DFID’s Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department (CHAD) provided </p>
<p>specific policy and operational advice on Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Decision-making machinery pre-conflict</b></p>
<p><b>139. </b> Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that between January 1998 and January 1999 he had </p>
<p>attended and noted 21 Ministerial discussions on Iraq; 10 in Cabinet, of which seven </p>
<p>had “some substance”; five in the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP); and </p>
<p>six ad hoc meetings, including one JIC briefing.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>140. </b> The Cabinet Office informed the Inquiry that there was no discussion of Iraq in </p>
<p>DOP in 1999 or 2000, and that the four discussions in Cabinet in early 1999 (the last on </p>
<p>7 March) were confined to brief updates on the No-Fly Zones.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> There is no record of </p>
<p>any Cabinet discussion of Iraq in 2000.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> In contrast, Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that between 9/11 and January 2002 </p>
<p>he attended 46 Ministerial meetings on international terrorism and/or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those were: 13 Cabinet meetings (four of which were very short); 12 meetings of a new </p>
<p>Cabinet Committee, DOP(IT) (Defence and Overseas Policy (International Terrorism)), </p>
<p>which was set up as a sort of “War Cabinet”; and 21 ad hoc meetings, although many </p>
<p>of those had taken place “round the Cabinet table”.</p>
<p><b>The Defence and Overseas Policy Committee</b></p>
<p><b>142. </b> DOP, formally a Sub Committee of the Cabinet, was created in 1963, with Terms of </p>

<p>International Development Secretary. The CDS attended as required.</p>
<p><b>The conventions used in Cabinet minutes</b></p>
<p>The <i>Guide to Minute Taking</i> produced by the Cabinet Office in June 2001 said that the </p>
<p>first purpose of a minute was to set out the conclusions reached so that those who have to </p>
<p>take action know precisely what to do; the second purpose was to “give the reasons why </p>
<p>the conclusions were reached”.</p>
<p>The <i>Guide</i> said:</p>
<p>“A good minute of a meeting will be:</p>
<p>i. </p>
<p>brief but intelligible;</p>
<p>ii. </p>
<p>self-contained;</p>
<p>iii. </p>
<p>in the main, impersonal; and</p>
<p>iv. </p>
<p>to the full extent that the discussion allows, decisive.”</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>The <i>Guide</i> made clear that a minute was “not a substitute for a verbatim record” and </p>
<p>should not reproduce points made by every speaker. Instead they should be grouped into </p>
<p>paragraphs which develop the argument.</p>
<p>Points should be attributed to an individual when “a specifically departmental view has </p>
<p>been put forward, or a suggestion has been made to safeguard a departmental interest”, </p>
<p>or when a speaker reserves their position or registers dissent. Dissent to the conclusions </p>
<p>of a Cabinet meeting should only be recorded if the dissenting Minister indicates an </p>
<p>intention to resign.</p>
<p>The <i>Guide</i> advised that when the Chair had summed up a discussion “it is usually </p>
<p>convenient to record this as a formal summing up” to record “the sense of the meeting” </p>
<p>and avoid lengthy conclusions. A minute should end with conclusions which are “clear </p>
<p>and precise”.</p>
<p>The <i>Guide</i> explained that conventions govern the formulae used to indicate different </p>
<p>kinds of action, which reflected “the constitutional position of Ministers as individually </p>
<p>responsible for matters covered by their department while sharing in the collective </p>
<p>responsibility of members of the Government”. The formulae also distinguished the </p>
<p>positions of the Chair of a Committee and its Secretariat. They were:</p>
<p>“The Committee–</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>Approved [a memorandum].</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>Agreed [on a course of action].</p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>Agreed to resume their discussion …</p>

<p><b>The Ad Hoc Meeting (the War Cabinet)</b></p>
<p><b>144. </b> In June 2002, officials began to discuss changes to the Government’s machinery </p>
<p>for Iraq policy and planning.</p>
<p><b>145. </b> Recommendations to improve Whitehall co-ordination at official and Ministerial </p>
<p>level were put to Mr Blair in mid-September.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Mr Tom McKane, Deputy Head of OD Sec, sent Sir David Manning a note on </p>
<p>possible machinery “for managing Iraq” on 2 September.</p>
<p>91 </p>
<p>He recalled that he and </p>
<p>Sir David had already agreed that, “following the pattern of Afghanistan”, there should </p>
<p>be two groups of officials: an “inner group” chaired by Sir David (or Mr Desmond Bowen </p>
<p>who would shortly be taking over from Mr McKane) and a more junior “wider group”, </p>
<p>chaired by Mr Bowen or Mr Drummond.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Mr McKane proposed that the inner group “should begin work once you [Sir David </p>
<p>Manning] decide that the time is right”. It would comprise the Chair of the JIC or Chief of </p>
<p>the Assessments Staff, the FCO Middle East Director, the DCDS(C) and/or Mr Ian Lee </p>
<p>(MOD Director General Operational Policy), and representatives of all three Intelligence </p>
<p>Agencies and the Home Office. Mr McKane asked whether it should also include the </p>
<p>Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) and a No.10 information specialist. He proposed that the </p>
<p>wider group “should meet periodically from now on and, inter alia, address the issues set </p>
<p>out in Jim Drummond’s minute of 30 August”.</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Mr McKane wrote that “we also need to consider the composition of a Ministerial </p>
<p>Group”. He recommended the creation of a separate Ad Hoc Sub-Committee of </p>
<p>DOP, chaired by the Prime Minister, with the participation of the Foreign and Defence </p>
<p>Secretaries and the Intelligence Chiefs. DOP “could meet less frequently and be the </p>
<p>means of formalising decisions”. Mr McKane also suggested that Lord Goldsmith, the </p>
<p>Attorney General, be invited “to be in attendance at both these groups, as required” and </p>
<p>Mr Robin Cook, the Leader of the House, “be invited to attend DOP”.</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Sir David Manning put the proposals to Mr Blair on 12 September.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At official level, </p>
<p>Sir David recommended that he or Mr Bowen should chair an inner group, to include </p>
<p>the JIC, the FCO, the MOD, SIS, the Security Service, GCHQ, the Home Office and </p>
<p>Sir David Omand, the Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary.</p>

<p>No.10 and the FCO.</p>
<p><b>151. </b> In his advice to Mr Blair, Sir David Manning adjusted slightly Mr McKane’s proposal </p>
<p>for a Ministerial Group. He suggested:</p>
<p>“If we follow the Afghan precedent, we would set up an Ad Hoc Group (perhaps </p>
<p>technically a Sub-Committee of DOP under your chairmanship) to include Jack </p>
<p>[Straw], Geoff [Hoon], CDS [Admiral Sir Michael Boyce], C [Sir Richard Dearlove] </p>
<p>and No.10. The idea would be to keep it tight with meetings in the Den. If we move </p>
<p>to military action, we would, of course, need to widen this to include John Prescott </p>
<p>[the Deputy Prime Minister], David Blunkett [the Home Secretary] and perhaps </p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>“This leaves the question of what to do about the Attorney. I assume that </p>
<p>you would not want him to attend your Ad Hoc Group except by invitation </p>
<p>on specific occasions.”</p>

<p>“… in one sense I would like to say ‘yes’, because it would be in a way an easy </p>
<p>enough concession to make. My frank belief is it would not have made a great deal </p>
<p>of difference, no. The committee meetings that we had, small ‘a’, small ‘h’, ad hoc </p>
<p>meetings, I think there were 28 of them, 14 of which were minuted. I had the right </p>
<p>people there … no-one was saying to me ‘Do it a different way’. I mean, if someone </p>
<p>had I would have listened to it, but I have to say to you in addition when I looked, </p>
<p>for example, at Mrs Thatcher’s War Cabinet, it didn’t have the Chancellor of the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>156. </b> A member of OD Sec wrote to Sir David Manning on 30 January with a draft minute </p>
<p>from Sir Andrew Turnbull to Mr Blair setting out “on a contingency basis” a proposal for </p>
<p>“meeting and briefing arrangements for handling any conflict with Iraq”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> The official </p>
<p>suggested that Sir David might like to discuss the issue with Mr Blair before the draft </p>
<p>was submitted to Sir Andrew.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> The draft minute proposed that, “given the sensitivity of the issues to be </p>
<p>discussed”, the “War Cabinet” should be a “very small, informal group” “limited to </p>
<p>the Foreign Secretary, the Defence Secretary, CDS, C, John Scarlett plus a small </p>
<p>Secretariat”. There was also “a case for including a non-departmental Cabinet Minister </p>
<p>who is not quite so close to the action”. The membership could also be “extended <b>as </b></p>
<p><b>necessary on a case by case basis</b>, if there was a need to involve any other Minister </p>
<p>(such as the Attorney General or Development Secretary) in the discussions”.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> The draft stated:</p>
<p>“The core group could be formally constituted as a Cabinet Committee. But I </p>
<p>recommend that it be established as an Ad Hoc Ministerial Committee. This would </p>
<p>help foster an air of informality and obviate the need to publish any composition and </p>
<p>terms of reference.”</p>
<p><b>159. </b> The covering minute to Sir David stated that:</p>
<p>“In terms of managing the business this is fine. But in the absence of a formally </p>
<p>constituted ‘War Cabinet’ as we had with Afghanistan, which was the public face </p>
<p>of decision taking, could lead to unhelpful speculation about how the conflict was </p>
<p>being managed. Other Ministers might also feel excluded. One way round the </p>
<p>problem would be for DOP to be convened occasionally (thereby bringing in Clare </p>
<p>Short and Gordon Brown) when there is a need for a wider discussion – perhaps </p>
<p>before Cabinet each week. This would be in addition to more regular meetings of </p>
<p>the inner group.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> The draft minute stated that COBR should be “activated in the immediate run </p>
<p>up to any military action, and manned on a 24 hour basis”; and that: “As during the </p>
<p>Afghanistan conflict, David Manning would chair official-level meetings (both in </p>
<p>restricted and wider formats) to co-ordinate and galvanise Departmental activity and </p>
<p>to ensure that you are properly briefed on developments.” A daily intelligence update, </p>
<p>an ‘Overnight Sitrep’ prepared early each morning “covering the main international and </p>
<p>military developments”, and “a more detailed thematic ‘Evening Round-Up’ following the </p>
<p>Afghanistan model” were also proposed.</p>

<p>293</p>
<p><b>161. </b> The official also informed Sir David that the MOD was planning on the basis of </p>
<p>a daily press briefing at 1000, and the importance of striking a balance between the </p>
<p>various briefings in theatre, London and Iraq.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Sir David Manning sent the minute to Mr Jonathan Powell, writing: “Grateful if we </p>
<p>could discuss.”</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>163. </b> An ‘Ad Hoc Meeting’ of Ministers took place daily from 19 March to 12 April, with </p>
<p>the exception of Sundays 30 March and 6 April. The Committee then met five times </p>
<p>before the end of April.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to Sir Andrew Turnbull on 5 March stating:</p>
<p>“I am sure you have this in hand already, but in case it might help, I should like to </p>
<p>offer you my thoughts on the procedure for handling the legal basis for any offensive </p>
<p>operations … in Iraq – a subject touching on my responsibilities since it is the CDS </p>
<p>who will need to be assured that he will be acting on the basis of a lawful instruction </p>
<p>from the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary.</p>
<p>“It is not possible to be certain about the precise circumstances in which this would </p>
<p>arise because we cannot be sure about the UN scenario involved … Clearly full UN </p>
<p>cover is devoutly to be desired – and not just for the military operation itself …</p>
<p>“My purpose in writing, however, is not to argue the legal merits of the case … but to </p>
<p>flag up … that the call to action from President Bush could come at quite short notice </p>
<p>and that we need to be prepared to handle the legalities so we can deliver …</p>
<p>“In these circumstances, I suggest that the Prime Minister should be prepared </p>
<p>to convene a special meeting of the inner ‘war’ Cabinet (Defence and Foreign </p>
<p>Secretaries certainly, Chancellor, DPM [Deputy Prime Minister], Home Secretary </p>
<p>possibly, Attorney General, crucially) at which CDS effectively receives his legal and </p>
<p>constitutional authorisation. We have already given the Attorney General information </p>
<p>and MOD briefings on objectives and rationale, and I understand that John Scarlett </p>
<p>is conducting further briefing on the basis of the intelligence material.</p>
<p>“While it is not possible to predict the timing of the event precisely … could </p>
<p>conceivably be as early as 10 March … in the event, albeit unlikely, that the </p>
<p>Americans lost hope in the UN and move fast. Michael Jay may have a better fix on </p>
<p>this, but I guess the more likely timing would be for Security Council action around </p>
<p>the weekend of 15/16 March, and therefore for a meeting after that.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>165. </b> In a minute of 14 March, Mr Powell recorded that “we have agreed” that Mr Blair </p>
<p>would start to hold daily meetings of a ‘War Cabinet” from 0830 on 19 March. Mr Powell </p>

<p>101</p>
<p> The minute said:</p>

<p>OD Sec would produce a short note recording the main decisions after each </p>
<p>meeting, which would be “sent only to those who attend”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There might also be a case for having weekly meetings of DOP (including the </p>
<p>Chancellor and Home Secretary in addition), perhaps convening just before </p>
<p>Cabinet. This would provide an opportunity for wider Ministerial involvement, </p>
<p>including on day after issues. I suggest this is something that David Manning </p>
<p>keeps under review.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>COBR was being activated on a 24 hour basis on 18 March: “As during </p>
<p>the Afghanistan conflict” Sir David Manning would “chair official level </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The Assessments Staff were producing daily written intelligence updates, which </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>178. </b> The Chairman of the JIC<b> </b>is “responsible for the broad supervision of the work </p>
<p>of the JIC” and “specifically charged with ensuring that the Committee’s warning </p>
<p>and monitoring role” was “discharged effectively”. He also has direct access to the </p>
<p>Prime Minister.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the JIC was designed to be at the interface </p>
<p>between intelligence and policy.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> The Chairman of the JIC played a key role:</p>
<p>“… to represent the views, which are very thoroughly considered, of the JIC itself. </p>
<p>He doesn’t have a separate status, separate from the Committee itself. He carries </p>
<p>his authority, because he is carrying the authority of the Committee and he is </p>
<p>representing those views.”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that he was “answerable” to Sir David Omand “for </p>
<p>the efficient functioning of the Committee and the Secretariat”, but he was “responsible </p>
<p>for the presentation of intelligence assessment to Government”.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>181. </b> The JIC is supported by the Joint Intelligence Organisation (JIO), including the </p>
<p>Assessments Staff, comprising analysts seconded to the Cabinet Office from other </p>
<p>departments. The JIO<b> </b>is “responsible for drafting assessments of situations and issues </p>
<p>of current concern”, taking “into account all sources of information, including intelligence </p>
<p>reports produced by the Agencies, diplomatic reporting and media reports”.</p>
<p><b>182. </b> The Assessments Staff’s draft Assessments are subject to formal inter-</p>
<p>departmental scrutiny and challenge in Current Intelligence Groups (CIGs), which </p>
<p>bring together working-level experts from a range of government departments and the </p>
<p>intelligence agencies. In the case of Iraq between 2001 and 2003, the CIG brought </p>
<p>together the desk-level experts from the FCO (including MED and RA), MOD (including </p>
<p>DIS), the Cabinet Office and the intelligence agencies, and any other department with </p>
<p>an interest in the issue being considered.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> The JIC’s terms of reference from 2001 to 2005 included responsibilities to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“monitor and give early warning of the development of direct or indirect foreign </p>
<p>threats to British interest, whether political, military or economic”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“on the basis of available information, to assess events and situations relating to </p>
<p>external affairs, defence, terrorism, major international criminal activity, scientific, </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“keep under review threats to security at home and overseas and to deal with </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“report to the Secretary of the Cabinet”, except where “special assessments” </p>
<p>were required by the Chiefs of Staff, which would be “submitted to them directly </p>
<p>in the first instance”.</p>
<p><b>184. </b> The JIC agrees most Assessments before they are sent to Ministers and senior </p>
<p>officials, although some papers, including urgent updates on developing issues, are </p>
<p>issued under the authority of the Chief of the Assessments Staff.</p>
<p><b>185. </b> The current JIC terms of reference make clear that it is expected to draw on “secret </p>
<p>intelligence, diplomatic reporting and open source material.”</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>186. </b> JIC Assessments are most frequently produced in response to a request from a </p>
<p>policy department which determines the precise issues to be addressed. The JIC also </p>
<p>commissions Assessments and can direct that the ground covered in any Assessment </p>
<p>should be amended if it considers that is required.</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Some CIG Assessments are issued under the authority of the Chief of the </p>
<p>Assessments Staff and are noted but not discussed by the JIC, including where the </p>
<p>content is regarded as routine or as an update of previous Assessments.</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Iraq was regularly considered by the JIC in 2000 and 2001, with the focus </p>
<p>on weapons of mass destruction (WMD), sanctions and the implications of the </p>
<p>No-Fly Zones.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Sir John Scarlett considered that Iraq had been one of the top priorities for the </p>
<p>JIC for most of his time as Chairman.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>190. </b> As Chairman of the JIC, Mr Scarlett attended many of the meetings on Iraq held by </p>
<p>Mr Blair and provided advice and briefing, including in response to requests from No.10.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> In late July 2002, Mr Scarlett was asked to provide updated intelligence on Iraq on </p>
<p>a weekly basis for Mr Blair’s weekend box.</p>

<p>HE AD HOC GROUP ON IRAQ</p>
<p><b>196. </b> On 26 June 2002, Mr Webb informed Mr Hoon’s Private Office that MOD officials </p>
<p>were encouraging the Cabinet Office to supplement the Pigott Group (an MOD-led, </p>
<p>inter-departmental group of senior officials – see Section 6.4) with a broader body </p>
<p>involving a wider range of departments with a policy interest in Iraq and the region.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>197. </b> Those ideas began to take shape on 8 August, when Mr Jim Drummond, </p>

<p>117</p>
<p> Mr Drummond explained </p>
<p>that one consequence of existing Whitehall mechanisms for discussing Iraq, including </p>
<p>in particular the Pigott Group’s focus on military matters, was that “we are focusing </p>
<p>a lot on military aspects and less on the alliance building, morning after, unintended </p>
<p>consequences etc. Come September there may be a case for a tighter grip from </p>
<p>the Centre.”</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Drummond raised the issue with Sir David Manning again on 30 August. He </p>
<p>recalled that Sir David had commented earlier in the summer that it was too soon to </p>
<p>think about management of the unintended consequences of conflict, but that the issue </p>
<p>would probably need to be discussed in the autumn.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Mr Drummond enclosed a “skeleton” paper on the subject prepared by a Cabinet </p>
<p>Office junior official and suggested meeting to discuss the paper and Whitehall </p>
<p>machinery for Iraq at the same time.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> The Cabinet Office paper on unintended consequences focused on the </p>
<p>possible impact of war on UK interests and on countries in the region, rather than on </p>
<p>post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p><b>201. </b> The FCO produced a more substantial paper on the unintended consequences of </p>
<p>conflict for the region and beyond on 20 September (see Section 6.4).</p>

<p>Mr Hoon on 17 September:</p>
<p>“Mindful of the difficulties (and frustrations) we have experienced in the past in </p>
<p>establishing the right machinery and processes to run crucial politico/military </p>
<p>campaigns, I saw David Manning yesterday to discuss the arrangements which </p>
<p>might be presented to the Prime Minister, designed to help successful delivery of </p>
<p>an Iraq campaign.</p>
<p>“I reminded David of the importance of a small ‘core’ Ministerial team, meeting very </p>
<p>regularly to execute daily business (as distinct from less frequent policy meetings </p>
<p>and Cabinet itself). I outlined the linkage needed with the wider COBR and DOP </p>
<p>machinery that would pull in government departments and agencies as a whole …</p>
<p>“David said that he had little influence over such matters as distinct from Jonathan </p>
<p>[Powell]. However, he took the point, especially about the importance of acting </p>
<p>through key Ministers in small groups. The position at present was that the Prime </p>
<p>Minister had decided over the weekend on the following:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>no Ministerial meetings at this stage;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>a preference, when they became necessary, for the ‘late Afghan’ model to </p>
<p>apply – ie PM; Defence Secretary; Foreign Secretary; CDS; C; Scarlett; </p>
<p>Attorney General and Alastair Campbell as appropriate;</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>meanwhile for Restricted COBR meetings to begin on a twice weekly basis </p>
<p>under Manning’s chairmanship;</p>
<p>d. </p>
<p>for a wider DOP Committee of officials to begin work, under Bowen’s </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>207. </b> Sir Kevin commented:</p>
<p>“This seems satisfactory for the time being, although we shall need to watch to </p>
<p>ensure that (b) does not begin without you being present and that (c) provides the </p>
<p>framework we need to link effectively with the contingency planning in the MOD </p>
<p>(and perhaps to begin to consider tricky issues of wider relevance, eg the effect on </p>
<p>energy prices and oil aftermath management). I should have preferred Bowen to run </p>
<p>a restricted officials forum, given the other pressures on Manning’s time, the need </p>
<p>to begin setting a regular rhythm, and some of the wider issues to be confronted. </p>
<p>But I do not think we can do better for the present.”</p>
<p><b>208. </b> At official level, the cross-Whitehall Ad Hoc Group on Iraq (AHGI) met for the first </p>
<p>time on 20 September 2002. It became the principal forum for co-ordination of planning </p>
<p>and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein or post-conflict Iraq (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>209. </b> Mr Bowen told the Inquiry that when the AHGI started its work in September 2002, </p>
<p>the context was “a serious policy commitment to deal with weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>in Iraq”.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> Conflict was just one of “any number of outcomes”.</p>
<p>COBR(R)</p>
<p><b>210. </b> In his 12 September minute to Mr Blair, Sir David Manning recommended that he </p>
<p>should chair an “Inner Group”, to include the JIC, the FCO, the MOD, SIS, the Security </p>
<p>Service, GCHQ, the Home Office and Sir David Omand.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>211. </b> A “Wider Group”, tasked by the Inner Group and chaired by OD Sec, would include, </p>
<p>additionally, DFID, the Metropolitan Police, the Treasury, the Department of Trade and </p>
<p>Industry and media specialists from No.10 and the FCO.</p>
<p><b>212. </b> The Inner Group, which discussed a range of issues including counter-terrorism </p>
<p>and Afghanistan and was not minuted (although actions were recorded in some </p>
<p>instances), was known as the Restricted COBR or COBR(R); the wider group was </p>
<p>the AHGI.</p>
<p><b>213. </b> Sir David Manning told Mr Blair that:</p>
<p>“This Wider Group would be tasked as necessary by the Inner Group.”</p>
<p><b>214. </b> When he reported the new arrangements to Mr Hoon on 17 September, </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit explained that the Prime Minister had decided there should be no </p>
<p>Ministerial meetings at this stage, but that twice weekly Restricted COBR meetings </p>
<p>chaired by Sir David Manning and a wider officials’ group under Mr Desmond Bowen </p>
<p>(Mr McKane’s successor), should begin their work.</p>

<p>some of the wider issues to be confronted.”</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Asked to explain the Whitehall arrangements, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that the Restricted group chaired by himself or his deputy included “all those who had </p>
<p>access to the most sensitive intelligence”.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> It was not focused solely on Iraq, and often </p>
<p>had other pressing issues to deal with but:</p>
<p> “… it was an opportunity to bring – to report on the progress that different </p>
<p>departments had made, on the latest assessment that may have come out of the </p>
<p>agencies, the political issues that were being confronted by the Foreign Office, </p>
<p>the difficulties that the Ministry of Defence might be encountering and so on and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that the role of COBR(R) was “to take the fallout from </p>
<p>that War Cabinet meeting and try and take things forward”.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>Creation of the Iraq Planning Unit</b></p>
<p><b>223. </b> The inter-departmental (FCO/MOD/DFID) Iraq Planning Unit (IPU), based in </p>
<p>the FCO, was established on 10 February to improve Whitehall co-ordination on </p>
<p>post-conflict issues.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Although the IPU was an inter-departmental unit, its head was a senior member of </p>
<p>the Diplomatic Service and it was integrated into the FCO management structure.</p>
<p><b>225. </b> The draft terms of reference stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IPU would report to Mr Chaplin in the FCO, but without defining the </p>
<p>relationship between the Unit and senior officials in DFID and the MOD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IPU would work “within broad policy guidelines set by the Cabinet Office”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Its main purpose would be to provide “policy guidance on practical questions” </p>
<p>that UK civilian officials and military commanders would face in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IPU was intended “to bring influence to bear on US plans”.</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Tasks assigned to the IPU by the AHGI included consideration of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the shape of the Iraqi political process needed to underpin the transition to </p>
<p>Iraqi rule;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>management of Iraq’s oil; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether and where the UK should run its own sector before the restoration of </p>
<p>Iraqi sovereignty.</p>
<p><b>227. </b> After the creation of the IPU, the AHGI remained responsible for co-ordination of all </p>
<p>post-conflict planning and preparation across government, including consular planning </p>
<p>and civil contingencies.</p>
<p><b>228. </b> On 3 February, Mr Ehrman reported to Mr Ricketts that the Pigott Group had </p>
<p>decided that there was a need for a senior FCO official to co-ordinate full-time with </p>
<p>MOD, DFID and others the rapidly increasing volume of work on aftermath planning.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>229. </b> Mr Ehrman suggested that “in addition to work on overall legality … we will need </p>
<p>sub-groups on WMD, OFF [the Oil-for-Food programme], SSR [Security Sector Reform], </p>
<p>humanitarian, reconstruction, judicial, possibly terrorism. All this to feed into and </p>
<p>influence the various aftermath groups in Washington.”</p>

<p>303</p>
<p><b>230. </b> Mr Ricketts informed Mr Chaplin on 4 February that he had agreed with </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay and Mr Ehrman that:</p>
<p>“… the FCO should consolidate the lead we have already taken in this area </p>
<p>[post-conflict issues] with the work that Dominick Chilcott has been doing under </p>
<p>your supervision.</p>
<p>“I am sure that this work will now grow fast, particularly with the prospect of </p>
<p>the UK inheriting responsibility for a good slice of southern Iraq following a </p>
<p>military conflict.”</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Mr Bowen chaired a meeting in the Cabinet Office on 4 February, attended by </p>
<p>the FCO, MOD and DFID, at which it was decided to set up an inter-departmental </p>
<p>(FCO, MOD and DFID) unit, headed by an FCO official, Mr Chilcott, to “prepare for </p>
<p>the aftermath in practical operational terms”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> Wider strategy would continue to be </p>
<p>co-ordinated through the AHGI.</p>
<p><b>232. </b>  In a letter to Mr Ehrman recording the outcome of the meeting, Mr Bowen </p>
<p>explained that there was “a good deal of uncertainty about American intentions in </p>
<p>administering Iraq in the event of (and after) hostilities to remove Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>regime”. Meetings in Washington that week were likely to bring greater clarity but were </p>
<p>unlikely to produce decisions.</p>
<p><b>233. </b> Mr Bowen reported that the meeting had recognised that:</p>
<p>“… even if some of the big strategic issues remained unresolved, a lot of detailed </p>
<p>management issues were likely to arise. Much was likely to emanate from </p>
<p>CENTCOM, which had the prospectively imminent task of administering a country </p>
<p>whose leadership had been removed. With this in mind we agreed that we should </p>
<p>set up an Iraq Operational Policy Unit with contributions from the FCO, DFID </p>
<p>and MOD … My view was that we needed an integrated unit with high calibre </p>
<p>representation to work through the sort of issues that would confront the Coalition </p>
<p>on the ‘day after’. <b>Their initial remit would be to develop policy guidance to </b></p>
<p><b>enable the administration of Iraq pending the appointment of a transitional </b></p>
<p><b>civil administration, consistent as far as possible with the longer term vision </b></p>
<p><b>for the future of Iraq.</b> They would need to work their way, with the US, through </p>
<p>issues as diverse as humanitarian relief, policing, administration of justice, local </p>
<p>government and provision of utilities, environmental recovery and priorities for the </p>
<p>return to normality. The view we all reached was that this unit ought to be up and </p>
<p>running from Monday 10 February … It will need staff who think strategically and </p>
<p>operationally and have some background in state reconstruction from other cases </p>
<p>(in order to feed in the lessons of eg Kosovo and Afghanistan).”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Bowen explained that the unit would work alongside the FCO consular and </p>
<p>emergency units, and with the Defence Crisis Management Centre (DCMC) in the MOD </p>
<p>and the Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department (CHAD) in DFID.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> The Iraq Planning Unit (IPU), headed by Mr Dominick Chilcott, was established on </p>
<p>10 February.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>236. </b> On 17 February, Sir Michael Jay sent draft terms of reference for the IPU to </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, copied to Permanent Secretaries. The draft, </p>
<p>which had already been discussed with DFID, the MOD and the Cabinet Office, stated:</p>
<p>“The unit will operate within broad policy guidelines set by the Cabinet Office. </p>
<p>In the FCO, it will report to the Director Middle East and North Africa Command </p>
<p>[Mr Chaplin]. Its main customers will be British military planners in PJHQ, </p>
<p>MOD and, mainly through them, British officers and officials seconded to the </p>
<p>Pentagon and CENTCOM.</p>
<p>“The main purpose of the unit will be to provide policy guidance on the practical </p>
<p>questions that British civilian officials and military commanders will face, in the </p>
<p>event of a conflict in Iraq. The advice will be designed to help them to minimise the </p>
<p>suffering of the Iraqi people and to deal with the civil administration of any sector </p>
<p>of Iraq under the control of British forces, particularly during the period before a </p>
<p>transitional civilian administration is established. It will aim to ensure that British </p>
<p>operational military planning for the post-conflict phase in Iraq is consistent with </p>
<p>and promotes the UK’s policy objectives on the future of Iraq. In doing so it will take </p>
<p>particular account of the key role of the UN.</p>
<p>“The unit will aim to bring influence to bear on US plans by providing similar </p>
<p>guidance, through PJHQ and MOD, to seconded British personnel working within </p>
<p>the US military planning machinery and through the Embassy to the NSC and other </p>
<p>parts of the US Administration.</p>
<p>“The unit will also provide a focus in Whitehall for developing policy advice </p>
<p>and recommendations, as required, on strategic questions concerning a post </p>
<p>Saddam Iraq.</p>
<p>“The role of the unit will be reviewed in three months.”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>237. </b> The record of the 17 February meeting of the AHGI stated that the IPU had been </p>
<p>formed initially “to meet a UK military planning need for detailed policy guidance on </p>
<p>occupation issues”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> In the event of UK participation in the occupation of Iraq it was </p>

<p><b>238. </b> The record of the next meeting, on 21 February, described the co-ordinating role </p>
<p>of the AHGI:</p>
<p>“… the Ad Hoc Group draws together work related to Iraq as follows:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Work on post-Saddam issues led by the Iraq Planning Unit. This includes </p>
<p>the HMT [HM Treasury]-led sub-group on economic and financial issues;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Consular planning; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>HMT/CCS [Civil Contingencies Secretariat]-led domestic contingency </p>
<p>planning (the Stephens Group).</p>
<p>“AHGI receives updates on military and intelligence issues, but these issues </p>
<p>are handled elsewhere. AHGI provides a forum for deciding how to cover any </p>
<p>new Iraq-related issues. There is some read across from pre-existing DTI and </p>
<p>HMT Whitehall groups looking at oil.”</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>239. </b> After expressions of concern by Permanent Secretaries about the possible impact </p>
<p>on the UK of war in Iraq, Sir Andrew Turnbull had agreed in January 2003 that the AHGI </p>
<p>should conduct further work on domestic contingencies.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Chilcott told the Inquiry that, although numbers were small (“maybe only </p>
<p>six, eight, ten, for the first couple of weeks”), the IPU drew on expertise elsewhere </p>
<p>in Whitehall that allowed it to pull together a strategic view.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> While military planners </p>
<p>and PJHQ were planning what was needed as troops occupied territory and became </p>
<p>“responsible … for the administration of where they were”, the IPU was “thinking about </p>
<p>the political process and the big issues about the development fund for Iraq or oil policy </p>
<p>or what to do about war criminals or the importance of legitimacy and legal questions”.</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Asked how influential the IPU had been, Mr Chilcott stated:</p>
<p>“… I don’t think our main issue was having to convince other parts of the </p>
<p>government machinery that they should be doing things that they didn’t want to do.</p>
<p>“I think we were really synthesising the views and expertise across government.</p>
<p>“Where we needed to have clout … was in influencing the United States, and I think, </p>
<p>there, we … had no more clout than a sort of body of middle to senior ranking British </p>
<p>officials would have had with their American counterparts.”</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Chilcott warned against being “dazzled” by the IPU’s late creation: “a lot of </p>

<p>set up sooner:</p>
<p>“… one of the lessons is obviously you can’t begin this sort of thinking too early, </p>
<p>and although we did begin serious thinking about the day after in the preceding </p>
<p>October … we could have created the IPU earlier. We could have had a greater </p>
<p>sense of the reality of what we were doing. I think also, because it was contingency </p>
<p>planning, because right up until the last moment we didn’t know for sure that we </p>
<p>were going to be involved in the military action, that maybe psychologically had an </p>
<p>effect on us …”</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>243. </b> On the relationship with the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance </p>
<p>(ORHA), Mr Chilcott said that: “ORHA in some ways weren’t really our counterparts </p>
<p>because they were the sort of operational implementers … as well as the drawers up of </p>
<p>the plan, whereas we … were writing policy papers and briefing and lines to take.”</p>
<p>143</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Mr Bowen told the Inquiry one reason for establishing the IPU was to set up a </p>
<p>counterpart to ORHA: “as soon as we … understood where the centre of gravity was in </p>
<p>America … we set up … a centre of gravity that could interact with it”. At this early stage </p>
<p>in the relationship, before misgivings about ORHA had begun to emerge in Whitehall, </p>
<p>that seemed still to be the intention.</p>

<p><b>The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation</b></p>
<p><b>245. </b> On 27 March, Mr Bowen sent Sir Andrew Turnbull a draft minute addressed </p>
<p>to Mr Blair, recommending the creation of an “Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>Reconstruction” chaired by Mr Straw.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> Mr Bowen advised that he had opted for an ad </p>
<p>hoc group because it was “inherently more flexible and less ponderous than a formal </p>
<p>sub-group of DOP”.</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull wrote to Sir Kevin Tebbit on 31 March, seeking his and, among </p>
<p>others, Sir David Manning’s agreement to a slightly revised version of the draft minute </p>
<p>produced by Mr Bowen on 27 March.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> Sir Andrew advised that the revised draft had </p>
<p>already been agreed with Sir Michael Jay and Mr Chakrabarti.</p>

<p><b>247. </b> The draft minute proposed:</p>
<p>“… a new Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation reporting to you [Mr Blair]. </p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary [Mr Straw] should chair … Its terms of reference would be: </p>
<p>‘to formulate policy for the rehabilitation, reform and development of Iraq’.”</p>
<p><b>248. </b> The new Ministerial Group would be supported by an officials group, led by the </p>

<p><b>249. </b> The Inquiry has not seen a final version of Sir Andrew Turnbull’s minute.</p>
<p><b>250. </b> Mr Chakrabarti wrote to Sir Andrew Turnbull on 1 April, confirming that the new </p>
<p>groups proposed in Sir Andrew’s draft minute to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… seem the best way to take forward the detailed implications of any SCR’s </p>
<p>content, and what can be done before its passing … The key will be to agree </p>
<p>very quickly on the work programme and to task those with the knowledge and </p>
<p>experience in the subject areas to take the lead while consulting others with an </p>
<p>interest in ensuring all the workstreams fit together into a coherent – and affordable </p>
<p>– strategy. We must draw on the lessons learnt from other post-conflict situations </p>
<p>such as Afghanistan, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone and Bosnia.”</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull informed Mr Straw on 7 April that Mr Blair had agreed a new </p>
<p>committee should be established “to formulate policy for the rehabilitation, reform and </p>
<p>development of Iraq”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> Mr Straw would chair; other members would be the Chancellor </p>
<p>of the Exchequer, the Defence Secretary, the International Development Secretary and </p>
<p>the Trade and Industry Secretary. The committee would be supported by a group of </p>

<p>149</p>
<p><b>255. </b> The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq (AHGI) met for the first time on </p>
<p>16 September 2004, chaired by Mr Blair.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> It was established “to ensure the UK </p>
<p>government approach to Iraq was fully co-ordinated in the period up to Iraqi elections in </p>
<p>January 2005”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair intended that the Group should meet regularly.</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Mr Blair wrote a note to his Private Secretary on 25 February 2005 instructing </p>
<p>that Mr Straw be “put in charge” of the AHGI and asked to minute him each week with </p>
<p>actions on “eg reconstruction in the South; Sunni outreach; progress on security plan”.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>257. </b> On 10 March, in his first meeting as Chair, Mr Straw explained that Mr Blair “had </p>
<p>asked a core group of Ministers to meet on a weekly basis to focus more closely on the </p>
<p>delivery of policy in Iraq”.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>258. </b> On 18 March, Mr Blair reminded Mr Quarrey: “I need J[ack] S[traw] to do me a note </p>
<p>each week on progress (to keep him at it).”</p>

<p><b>The Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (Iraq)</b></p>
<p><b>260. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that the AHGI was set up “briefly” in order to </p>
<p>“give extra urgency to Whitehall work ahead of the Iraqi elections”.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> That was “very </p>
<p>complicated” and so, after the UK General Election in May 2005, arrangements were </p>
<p>“simplified” and a new Committee was established.</p>

<p> It continued </p>

<p><b>263. </b> After taking office as Prime Minister in June 2007, Mr Gordon Brown reorganised </p>
