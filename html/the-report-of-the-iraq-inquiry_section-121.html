<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of the UK’s Security Sector Reform (SSR) strategies, policies </p>
<p>and plans; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decision to disband the Iraqi Army;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to US&#8209;led SSR strategy developed in Baghdad;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the implementation of SSR in the South of Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the deployment of UK police officers to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>broader planning and preparation for the conflict in Iraq and its aftermath, which </p>
<p>is described in Section 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decision to remove some members of the Ba’ath Party from public office </p>
<p>after May 2003, a process known as de&#8209;Ba’athification, which is described in </p>
<p>Section 11.1; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq, which is described in </p>
<p>Sections 10.1 to 10.3; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the wider deployment of civilians to Iraq, which is described in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>Definition of terms</b></p>
<p><b>Security Sector Reform</b></p>
<p>The term “Security Sector Reform” (SSR) is used in this report to refer to work </p>
<p>to rebuild and reform Iraq’s security and justice institutions. The Organisation for </p>
<p>Economic Co&#8209;operation and Development (OECD) defines SSR as development work </p>
<p>that helps societies to “escape from a downward spiral wherein insecurity, crime and </p>
<p>underdevelopment are mutually reinforcing”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The OECD defines the security and justice sectors to include the following:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>core security actors (for example, armed forces, police, gendarmerie,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> border </p>
<p>guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>security management and oversight bodies (for example, ministries of defence </p>
<p>and internal affairs);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>justice and law enforcement institutions (for example, the judiciary, prisons, </p>
<p>prosecution services, traditional justice systems); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>non&#8209;statutory security forces (for example, guerrilla armies and private militias).</p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>OECD DAC, <i>Handbook on Security System Reform</i>, 2007.</p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>A gendarmerie is a military force charged with policing duties in a civilian population.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>The term “Security Sector Reform” is not used consistently, and is sometimes used </p>
<p>interchangeably with phrases such as “security system reform” and “Rule of Law”. The </p>
<p>term “Rule of Law” is often used to refer specifically to the justice sector.</p>
<p><b>Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration </b></p>
<p>Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) programmes are designed to </p>
<p>improve security and stability in post&#8209;conflict environments.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> DDR aims to deal with the </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict security problem that arises when those who were fighting in a conflict </p>
<p>(combatants such as soldiers or militia) are left without livelihoods or support networks.</p>
<p>DDR programmes usually include a process of removing weapons from combatants, </p>
<p>taking combatants out of military structures and helping them to reintegrate into society, </p>
<p>sometimes including integration into new security structures.</p>
<p><b>Iraqi Security Forces and Iraqi Police Service</b></p>
<p>The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) includes both the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Police Service </p>
<p>(IPS). However, these terms are not used consistently and the ISF is sometimes used to </p>
<p>refer solely to the Iraqi Army.</p>
<p><b>Police officers</b></p>
<p>For the purposes of the Report, the Inquiry has used the terms “civilians” and “police </p>
<p>officers” but not “civilian police officers”. That adheres to the widespread distinction </p>
<p>between police officers from the wide range of staff working within police forces who </p>
<p>are civilians. </p>
<p>Some of the documents referenced in the Report refer to “civilian police officers” as a </p>
<p>way of describing serving police officers seconded to Iraq. It appears that this description </p>
<p>is to draw a distinction between the military police (Royal Military Police and Ministry of </p>
<p>Defence police) and police officers from territorial forces in England, Wales, Scotland and </p>
<p>Northern Ireland. While the Inquiry may have reproduced the term “civilian police officers” </p>
<p>(sometimes abbreviated to CivPol) in footnotes or in direct quotes, it has otherwise </p>
<p>referred to “police officers” or “military police officers” in order to establish the same </p>
<p>distinction.</p>
<p><b>Pre&#8209;conflict consideration of SSR</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> Planning and preparation for the post&#8209;conflict period is described in detail in Section </p>
<p>6.5. One of the earliest references to SSR in Iraq identified by the Inquiry is in a </p>
<p>paper prepared for the Chiefs of Staff Strategic Think Tank on Iraq on 18 June 2002.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper, by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Strategic Planning Group (SPG), was </p>
<p>circulated to a limited number of senior MOD addressees. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The paper identified “post&#8209;conflict strategy” as one of eight components of a UK </p>
<p>military strategy for Iraq, recognising the need to “acknowledge that there will be </p>
<p>a post&#8209;conflict phase with an associated commitment, manpower and finance bill”. </p>
<p>Development of an SSR model, support for training and provision of equipment were </p>
<p>identified as tasks to be undertaken in the “medium term (six months to two years)”.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> From 20 September, the Cabinet Office&#8209;led Ad Hoc Group on Iraq (AHGI) </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinated all non&#8209;military cross&#8209;government work on post&#8209;conflict issues. The creation </p>
<p>and role of the AHGI is addressed in Section 2.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> In preparation for the first meeting of the AHGI, Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head </p>
<p>(Foreign Affairs) of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), </p>
<p>wrote to Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head of OD Sec, suggesting departmental </p>
<p>responsibilities for different strands of post&#8209;conflict planning.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Mr Drummond proposed </p>
<p>that reform of the security sector and civil service should be led by the MOD and the </p>
<p>Department for International Development (DFID). </p>
<p><b>7. </b> On 27 September, the AHGI discussed a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) </p>
<p>paper on scenarios for the future of Iraq.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> The paper stated: </p>
<p>“… we would not expect the armed forces and security services to switch allegiance </p>
<p>to any new government en masse in the event of wholesale regime change. It is </p>
<p>more likely that key tribal leaders would seek to establish tribal/regional power </p>
<p>bases.” </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The paper concluded that, in order to achieve its overarching priorities, the UK should </p>
<p>“if possible avoid the root and branch dismantling of Iraq’s governmental and security </p>
<p>structures”.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The AHGI called for the material on SSR in the paper to be expanded.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>10. </b> The following week, the FCO produced a paper entitled ‘Models for Administering </p>
<p>a Post&#8209;Saddam Iraq’.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> Early drafts described the military challenge of providing </p>
<p>security, including starting a Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) </p>
<p>programme (see Box, ‘Definition of terms’, earlier in this Section), but did not address </p>
<p>comprehensive reform of the security sector. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>11. </b> A later version of the paper, provided to the AHGI on 11 October, contained an </p>
<p>additional recommendation that:</p>
<p>“… the US and Coalition partners would need to retain overall responsibility for </p>
<p>Iraq’s security for some time after the conflict. How the different security&#8209;related </p>
<p>tasks (including Security Sector Reform) should be carried out and by whom needs </p>
<p>further consideration.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The record of the 11 October AHGI meeting did not mention SSR.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> A document </p>
<p>describing “contingency planning work” circulated alongside it recorded that the FCO </p>
<p>was drafting a paper on the topic. </p>
<p><b>13. </b> During October and November 2002, the FCO produced several drafts of a paper </p>
<p>on SSR.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> An early version, forwarded to the Cabinet Office on 18 October, listed a range </p>
<p>of post&#8209;conflict security issues that would need to be addressed in Iraq, including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What security structures would be appropriate for a post S[addam] H[ussein] </p>
<p>Iraqi Government? How do we arrive at an answer? What are the threats, </p>
<p>internal and external? Should we undertake a comprehensive review of the </p>
<p>armed forces?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To what extent do the size, task and organisation of the new security structures </p>
<p>depend on whether Iraq develops into a federation?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To what extent should the Kurds be integrated into the national structures? How </p>
<p>might this be achieved?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How do we replace an excessively large security apparatus with something ‘right </p>
<p>sized’? Reform or abolition? Which parts of the security apparatus might be loyal </p>
<p>to a new government and which not?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To what extent should we punish those members of the security apparatus who </p>
<p>have committed crimes against the Iraqi people (eg torture)?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Are we obliged to work with the new Iraqi Government on SSR or can it be </p>
<p>imposed?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How do we reform the working culture of the security sector so that it operates </p>
<p>on the basis of humanitarian values in support of legitimate government?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How can we resettle or rehabilitate those pre&#8209;Saddam individuals removed </p>
<p>from the security sector so that they do not work clandestinely for the </p>
<p>re&#8209;establishment of a S[addam] H[ussein]&#8209;type regime?”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The draft FCO paper on SSR informed a Cabinet Office paper of 1 November which </p>
<p>explored what Iraq could look like after Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> The Cabinet Office paper </p>
<p>drew together strands of work from across Government and was written as a steering </p>
<p>brief for talks on post&#8209;conflict issues in Washington with the US and Australia. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The paper assumed that the international community and UN would be willing to </p>
<p>assist with reconstruction. Following a period of transitional military government (up to </p>
<p>six months), the UN was expected to “rule” Iraq for about three years. SSR planning was </p>
<p>considered in the context of preparation for a UN administration.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The paper stated:</p>
<p>“There will need to be a Security Sector Reform process … Having dismantled </p>
<p>Saddam’s security apparatus, there will need to be a new one. This will require a </p>
<p>comprehensive plan agreed with and led by the US. The judiciary will need a total </p>
<p>rebuild as will the police. Decisions will need to be taken on the size and scope of </p>
<p>the Army and intelligence services.” </p>
<p><b>17. </b> The first round of talks between the US and UK on post&#8209;conflict planning took place </p>
<p>in Washington on 6 November.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> Reporting on the talks to Sir David Manning, the Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the OD Sec, Mr Drummond wrote:</p>
<p>“We are agreed on the need for rapid and comprehensive reform of existing </p>
<p>security structures. Very few of the many current structures can be allowed to </p>
<p>remain. We can expect the US to maintain a tight grip on this, but urged them to </p>
<p>think about the wider security sector including police and the need to arrive with </p>
<p>a plan (ie not as in Afghanistan).”</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Drummond chaired a meeting of the AHGI on 8 November.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> The Washington </p>
<p>talks were discussed in the meeting, but SSR was not. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> In mid&#8209;December, the FCO Middle East Department produced a paper describing </p>
<p>different models of interim administration for Iraq.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> That was shared with the US on </p>
<p>12 December. The FCO identified “initiating Security Sector Reform, especially the </p>
<p>reform of the police” as a “key element” that any international administration would need </p>
<p>to address in the short term. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The FCO Middle East Department explored further the issue of SSR in a separate </p>
<p>paper which was completed on 10 December.</p>

<p><b>21. </b> The final version of that SSR paper was produced in consultation with officials from </p>
<p>the MOD and DFID.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> As in earlier drafts, the paper did not propose how to conduct SSR, but instead </p>
<p>sought to identify which issues would need to be addressed by an SSR strategy.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Building on the earlier paper, it listed the issues in six categories: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What security structures would be appropriate? That should be based on an </p>
<p>assessment of the internal and external threats to Iraq, as well as consideration </p>
<p>of its future constitutional shape and the relative affordability of its armed forces. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Who should be in charge? The organisation of the international body that would </p>
<p>manage SSR activity should be given a high priority, “ideally before military </p>
<p>action”. That body would need to interact closely with the post&#8209;conflict interim </p>
<p>administration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Methodology. To what extent could reform be imposed by the US military or </p>
<p>UN&#8209;led government, and how far should the exclusion of members of the Tikriti </p>
<p>clan (Saddam Hussein’s clan) be taken?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DDR. Reducing the “bloated security sector” raised questions about resettling </p>
<p>those who had been removed and identifying mechanisms to bring perpetrators </p>
<p>of crimes against humanity to justice.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative change. How to reform the working culture of the </p>
<p>security sector, “particularly the police and the courts, so that it operates on the </p>
<p>basis of humanitarian values in support of a legitimate government”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Accountability. The new SSR structures should “ideally” be accountable to </p>
<p>civilian control. Enshrining the principle of civilian oversight would be “key to </p>
<p>establishing a fully accountable security apparatus”.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The FCO offered some “provisional” conclusions, including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From the outset, SSR should be at the centre of post&#8209;conflict work, rather </p>
<p>than outside it as happened in Afghanistan … we should begin discussing the </p>
<p>mechanism for the international community’s engagement in SSR before military </p>
<p>action begins.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As any SSR plan will have to address a number of complicated issues, we </p>
<p>should set up a UK working group now to start the detailed assessment to </p>
<p>enable us to engage with the US (and the academic community in the UK) </p>
<p>on SSR.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The new Iraqi administration should be involved as early as possible in the </p>
<p>process so as to feel ownership of the new structures.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There are some security organisations, staffed with Tikritis and Saddam’s </p>
<p>kinsmen and with a record of oppression, which should have no further future in </p>
<p>a post&#8209;S[addam] H[ussein] Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need to find out more about the civilian police and the judiciary.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ministers will need to decide the level of engagement of the UK in SSR, given </p>
<p>our limited and stretched resources.”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The paper was tabled as a living document “open to comment and improvement” </p>
<p>at the AHGI meeting on 13 December.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> The AHGI was told that “a Whitehall working </p>
<p>group on SSR in Iraq has now been established and can undertake further work”. The </p>
<p>SSR paper was one of four that the FCO had handed to Mr Zalmay Khalilzad, US </p>
<p>National Security Council (NSC) Senior Director and Ambassador at Large to the Iraqi </p>
<p>Opposition, “in an attempt to shape US thinking”. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> The second series of meetings between the UK, US and Australia to discuss </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict planning took place on 22 January 2003.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> In preparation, the FCO Middle </p>
<p>East Department drafted an “Annotated Agenda/overarching paper”. That was submitted </p>
<p>to Mr Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary, for approval of the “general line” that the UK </p>
<p>proposed to take in discussion.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> On SSR, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“Our handling of the defeated Iraqi forces will be critical. We shall need a DDR plan </p>
<p>for them, consistent with our vision for the future of Iraq’s armed forces. Experience </p>
<p>in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan has shown that we need to ensure consistency </p>
<p>between first steps and a longer&#8209;term vision on Security Sector Reform. As well as </p>
<p>ensuring the efficient use of our own resources, we shall want to find a way to allow </p>
<p>partners to join in SSR implementation. Does this work require new impetus?”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Straw approved the recommendations on 20 January. He reported that </p>
<p>Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, had told him the US working assumption was </p>
<p>that the US and UK would be in Iraq for a long time after military action.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The FCO paper was also shared with the US and Australia.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>29. </b> On 16 January, Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy </p>

<p>paper.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> The first suggested agenda item was security. “Key issues” for discussion </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to dismantle Iraq’s secret security agencies, and to handle the defeated </p>
<p>armed forces?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to provide legitimate and transparent law and order, and the necessary civil </p>
<p>structures to deliver them?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the co&#8209;operation of the Iraqi police …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>longer&#8209;term Security Sector Reform and DDR planning.”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Reporting to Mr Straw after the talks, Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle </p>
<p>East and North Africa, said that the exchanges had gone “better than expected”, but </p>
<p>also explained that “as we suspected, apart from on humanitarian relief and immediate </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict reconstruction, the US have not yet made much progress on a lot of the </p>
<p>day&#8209;after agenda”.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> No discussion of SSR was recorded in reports of the Washington talks to Ms Clare </p>
<p>Short, International Development Secretary, or Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Neither was it referred to in the reporting telegram from the Embassy. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> An FCO official who attended the talks reported to Mr Dominick Chilcott in the </p>
<p>Middle East Department that the “key message” was that Mr Donald Rumsfeld, </p>
<p>US Secretary of Defense, had ordered his staff to plan both the military and civil </p>
<p>administration of Iraq, and that this work was “going ahead fast, whether we like it </p>
<p>or not”.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> Plans were expected to be signed off in about a week’s time. Once that </p>
<p>had happened, the official judged that it would be “very difficult to reverse what </p>
<p>had been decided”. </p>
<p><b>33. </b> Following the talks, Mr Drummond proposed that six working groups should be </p>
<p>established to “pursue issues which require further planning”.</p>

<p>were tasked to consider planning for SSR.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>34. </b> On 20 January, the MOD Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) proposed the </p>
<p>creation of a ‘Common Document’ to provide a framework for UK Phase IV </p>
<p>28</p>
<p> planning.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was conceived as a “cross&#8209;Government agreed UK ‘manifesto’, from which we </p>
<p>would be able to guide subsequent engagement with the US”. It would also provide a </p>
<p>“mechanism for systematically identifying issues that needed to be resolved”.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The draft described a number of elements of SSR work, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disarmament/demobilisation and the future shape of the military; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>aspirations for the criminal justice system; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consideration of the military role in police mentoring.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the Common Document at their meeting on </p>
<p>29 January and concluded that it “would establish a framework UK policy, which would </p>
<p>… provide guidance to the embedded UK staffs charged with influencing US thinking”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>37. </b> The same day, Mr Bowen shared a draft paper on UK campaign objectives for Iraq </p>
<p>with Sir David Manning.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> The paper identified a number of “immediate military priorities” </p>
<p>for the Coalition in the aftermath of hostilities, including “lay plans for the reform of Iraq’s </p>
<p>security forces”. Mr Bowen commented that “it will be important … that we share the </p>
<p>same military objectives with the US, otherwise the strategic direction of the campaign </p>
<p>risks falling apart”. The objectives are addressed in further detail in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> On 4 February, Mr Drummond proposed that a special meeting on “aftermath” </p>
<p>should replace the AHGI scheduled for 7 February.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> That meeting would be used to </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinate a response to two US planning papers on post&#8209;war reconstruction and </p>
<p>would also cover the “state of preparedness” on a range of issues, including an agenda </p>
<p>item on SSR. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> The AHGI appears to have used the meeting to focus on preparing key messages </p>
<p>on post&#8209;conflict issues for Mr Hoon and Sir David Manning’s visit to Washington the </p>
<p>following week.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40. </b> A meeting about the post&#8209;conflict period took place at PJHQ offices on 5 February.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To support the discussion, PJHQ tabled a paper entitled ‘Iraq – Phase IV Subjects’.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>28 </p>
<p>Phase IV is a military term that describes the time after combat operations, when activities are </p>
<p>conducted to stabilise and reconstruct the area where combat took place. It can also be described as </p>
<p>“Stage IV”.</p>

<p><b>Iraq Planning Unit</b></p>
<p>The Iraq Planning Unit (IPU) was established on 10 February with Mr Dominick Chilcott, </p>
<p>FCO Middle East Department as its head. Its remit was “to develop policy guidance </p>
<p>to enable the administration of Iraq pending the appointment of a transitional civil </p>
<p>administration, consistent as far as possible with the longer&#8209;term vision for the future </p>

<p> Mr Bowen, defining the purpose of the Unit, wrote:</p>
<p>“They would need to work their way, with the US, through issues as diverse as </p>
<p>humanitarian relief, policing, administration of justice, local government and provision </p>
<p>of utilities, environmental recovery and priorities for the return to normality.”</p>
<p>The IPU was inter&#8209;departmental but based in the FCO.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>54. </b> On 12 February, responsibility for the ‘Iraq Stage IV Subjects Document’ was </p>

<p><b>55. </b> On 29 January, Mr Peter Gooderham, Political Counsellor at the British Embassy </p>
<p>Washington, reported that the NSC had asked whether the UK, as one of the Occupying </p>
<p>Powers, would be willing to take lead responsibility for reforming the Iraqi judicial system </p>
<p>and Iraqi Police Service (IPS).</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> The NSC said that the justice sector would be run by the </p>
<p>military Coalition in the immediate aftermath, but the Iraqis should “regain responsibility </p>
<p>for law and order as quickly as possible”. That was described as having “something up </p>
<p>and running within 60 days”. The UK would be “best suited” to take on this role because </p>
<p>of its “wealth of experience and expertise”. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> On 31 January, the UND submitted advice to Mr Straw, alerting him to the request </p>
<p>and stating that “this would be a massive undertaking, with implications for the UK’s role </p>
<p>as an ‘Occupying Power’, that should more properly be an international effort mandated </p>
<p>by the UN”.</p>

<p><b>63. </b> Mr Drummond wrote to Sir David Manning on 14 February to outline key messages </p>
<p>for the US on “winning the peace”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> Addressing the US request that the UK “lead on </p>
<p>reviving the Iraqi Justice system”, Mr Drummond reported that:</p>
<p>“We have asked for clarification of whether they see this as a short term revival </p>
<p>of existing structures minus the Ba’ath influence or a much longer term reform </p>
<p>agenda.”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> The following week, Mr Chilcott informed Mr Straw that an assessment of UK </p>
<p>capabilities in the field of police and judicial reform had been sent to the US, and that </p>
<p>a minute on the subject was in preparation, but was awaiting “greater clarity on UK </p>
<p>commitments”.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> In an accompanying document, Mr Chilcott described the UK  </p>
<p>position as: </p>
<p>“No commitment, but UK could consider providing support for UN&#8209;led justice sector </p>
<p>reform, providing we had the right UN cover.”</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr Straw responded the following day without comment on the UK’s role in </p>
<p>judicial reform.</p>

<p> The Government has been unable to supply evidence of any further </p>
<p>consideration of the US request.</p>
<p><b>SSR planning during the build&#8209;up to invasion</b></p>
<p><b>66. </b> In February and early March 2003, the main effort within the FCO and No.10 was </p>
<p>the pursuit of a further UN Security Council Resolution, as described in Section 3.7. </p>
<p>During this period, much of the debate around post&#8209;conflict management of Iraq focused </p>
<p>on the prospect of the UK taking responsibility for a geographical region following the </p>
<p>invasion, as described in Section 6.5. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> The MOD Iraq Secretariat briefed Mr Hoon on 10 February ahead of a visit to </p>
<p>Washington.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> They advised that US aftermath planning was “impressive on details”, but </p>
<p>“riddled with holes at the political and strategic levels”. The MOD identified a number of </p>
<p>factors for consideration:</p>
<p>“SSR will be a huge issue, both in dismantling the current infrastructure and growing </p>
<p>a new one. Will the US look to the current Iraqi police to maintain law and order, </p>
<p>or will it train a new force? If US AID<b> </b>[Agency for International Development] are </p>
<p>legally prevented from paying police or military salaries, how will SSR be funded </p>
<p>prior to the utilisation of oil revenues? What will the new security apparatus look </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>75. </b> The paper listed a number of mission objectives, including the formation of an </p>

<p><b>76. </b> The paper was structured to match the US organisation of Phase IV into three </p>
<p>stages: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Alpha – military administration while UN agencies and Non&#8209;Governmental </p>
<p>Organisations (NGOs) “tackle the humanitarian crisis”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bravo – an “international civil transitional administration”, supported by </p>

<p>ambitious reforms … to transform Iraq along the lines of the vision”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Charlie – the handover to a democratically elected Iraqi Government, during </p>
<p>which the international community would continue to support the restructuring of </p>
<p>Iraq’s economy and public administration. “Training of the armed forces and of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The MOD produced a number of papers in March that discussed SSR. </p>
<p><b>81. </b> On 7 March, an MOD “Red Team”, which had been established within the Defence </p>
<p>Intelligence Staff (DIS) (as described in Section 6.2), produced a report seeking to </p>
<p>identify “the optimum structure of the Immediate and Interim Administrations in Iraq </p>
<p>and other measures most likely to obtain and retain the support of the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The report stated that “law and order, including the judicial process, will require special </p>
<p>handling”. It stated that:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… once an assessment has been made of the effectiveness of local police </p>
<p>forces it should be increasingly possible to include them in military&#8209;led law and </p>
<p>order operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the judicial system is largely dysfunctional and … some form of interim judicial </p>
<p>system may be necessary; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the prison system is likely to require a complete overhaul and supervisory </p>
<p>regime, although the infrastructure may be useable.”</p>
<p><b>82. </b> The Red Team advised that: </p>
<p>“Expectations that the Coalition Forces will be able to deliver these responsibilities </p>
<p>[those of an Occupying Power under international law] are high; so if there is doubt </p>
<p>over our ability to meet them in an ‘exemplary’ fashion we should take steps to lower </p>
<p>expectations as early as possible.”</p>
<p><b>83. </b> On 11 March, the DIS issued a further assessment of the “political and security </p>
<p>environment” that Coalition troops would encounter in Basra.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> Though not specifically </p>
<p>focused on SSR, some of the judgements in the document illustrate the UK’s </p>
<p>pre&#8209;invasion understanding of the Iraqi security sector in what would become its Area </p>
<p>of Operations (AOR).</p>
<p><b>Area of Operations and Area of Responsibility</b></p>
<p>Area of Operations (AO) refers to the UK military’s area of combat operations during the </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq (Phase III of operations).</p>
<p>Area of Responsibility (AOR) refers to the area for which the UK military was responsible </p>
<p>during the post&#8209;conflict Occupation of Iraq (Phase IV of operations). </p>
<p>The two terms were often used interchangeably, sometimes in the same document. </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>84. </b> On the Iraqi police, the assessment stated:</p>
<p>“We have very little reporting on the organisation of Iraq’s Civil Police. And we have </p>
<p>no information specific to Basra … We have little idea as to how the police will act </p>
<p>during a Coalition attack or in the aftermath. Limited anecdotal reporting suggest </p>
<p>[sic] that they are likely to disappear from the street.”</p>
<p><b>85. </b> The establishment of law and order was described as an “important” factor in the </p>
<p>reaction of the Basra populace to Coalition control. However, the DIS judged that “in the </p>
<p>absence of a civil police force and other security forces this will prove difficult”.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The paper also addressed the dismissal of Ba’ath Party members from the military </p>
<p>and civil administration. The DIS assessed that:</p>
<p>“Directorate of General Security (DGS), DGI (Directorate of General Intelligence), </p>
<p>SSO (Special Security Organisations) elements and Ba’ath Party militia should be </p>
<p>disbanded. Ba’ath leadership (<i>Udw Firqa</i>/Fara) might also need to be detained …</p>
<p>“… But within Basra City there seems to [sic] no organisation with a better </p>
<p>understanding of tribal relationships, the civil populace, internal security matters and </p>
<p>provision of public services than the Ba’ath Party. Many party members will not have </p>
<p>been involved in repressive activity. We assess that Ba’ath Party members will have </p>
<p>to be utilised by any military administration, at least in the early phases of control.”</p>
<p><b>87. </b> On 18 March, the day before the invasion began, the MOD Defence Advisory </p>
<p>Team (DAT) produced a paper on SSR and the future Iraqi armed forces.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> The paper </p>
<p>was designed “to inform UK policy making and assist in advancing US thinking on </p>
<p>these topics”. Much of its content revisited the themes discussed in the FCO paper of </p>
<p>10 December 2002, which had already been shared with the US. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> The MOD paper listed the range of SSR activities in which the UK could be </p>
<p>expected to participate as follows: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DDR;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clearance of unexploded ordnance (de&#8209;mining);</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>of coherence between primary Coalition partners over SSR Policy”. The paper stated:</p>
<p>“Whilst the UK may try and influence the shape and content of such an SSR </p>
<p>strategy, the reality is that it will have to accommodate to the plans of the senior </p>
<p>Coalition partner/lead international body and their intentions for this area of activity.”</p>

<p><b>94. </b> A later Directive, issued on 30 July, included a “key” priority:</p>

<p><b>Planning the deployment of police officers</b></p>
<p><b>96. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of UND until June 2003, </p>
<p>described UND’s involvement in police matters as “essentially operational”.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Since </p>
<p>1997 UND had managed a Whitehall system to identify, train and deploy civilian police </p>
<p>overseas. Mr Pattison said:</p>
<p>“Obtaining sufficient UK police officers to take part in international policing was </p>
<p>always a struggle. We needed to get the co&#8209;operation of Chief Police Officers. And </p>
<p>we needed to find ways of attracting volunteers … We cast the net as wide as we </p>
<p>could, including canvassing recently retired officers.</p>
<p>“In most cases the overseas requirement was for armed police, which rules out </p>
<p>most UK officers. So we focused on getting UK officers into niche roles where their </p>
<p>expertise would add to the international police force’s skills, rather than into front line </p>
<p>executive policing.</p>
<p>“… And deploying UK police was not straightforward: all UK overseas police officers </p>
<p>are volunteers, ACPO [Association of Chief Police Officers] and the Home Office </p>
<p>would only agree to deployment when certain conditions were met (security, in </p>
<p>mission support structure) and the funding had to be identified.”</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Mr Pattison told the Inquiry that UND had not been tasked to undertake any </p>
<p>preparatory work, but had identified a potential problem and acted to address it.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said that there was no&#8209;one in Whitehall pulling together knowledge of policing to </p>
<p>design the kind of police operation needed in Iraq. In his recollection, “awareness of our </p>
<p>responsibilities under the Geneva Convention and Hague regulations did not inform our </p>
<p>thinking about policing in the run&#8209;up to the war.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Responsibilities under the Geneva and Hague regulations included that, as an </p>
<p>Occupying Force, the UK would assume responsibility for ensuring public order and </p>
<p>safety within their AO.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>99. </b> UND had assumed that the UK would not provide an “executive” police force (“a </p>
<p>force to do actual policing”) for Iraq, which would be a “massive undertaking”.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> Instead </p>
<p>the focus would be on supplying a “small number” of UK police to provide training and </p>
<p>advice on SSR, as had happened in other international policing missions. It was judged </p>
<p>that those police would need to be armed. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> Mr Pattison told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We were aware of the constraints and we were aware of roughly how many police </p>
<p>we could provide to do training and it wasn’t very many. This would have to be a </p>
<p>wholly voluntary force. Any police deployed would need the approval of their Chief </p>
<p>Constable. There were duty of care issues.</p>
<p>“You know, this was not going to be one of those situations where you could simply </p>
<p>turn on a tap of British police to go and help. It was going to be very difficult. We </p>
<p>[UND] certainly understood that, but I’m not aware that there was ever a serious </p>
<p>discussion of post&#8209;conflict police issues.”</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>101. </b> On 23 January, a junior official wrote to the Head of the UND Peacekeeping </p>
<p>Section to seek authorisation to proceed with “plans for the training of a small contingent </p>
<p>(30 officers) of Ministry of Defence Police for immediate deployment should they be </p>
<p>required”.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> The Minute stated: </p>
<p>“… we are taking these steps mindful of our experience in Kosovo, where the </p>
<p>Prime Minister committed us to deployment of UK civpol shortly after the liberation </p>
<p>of Pristina … In that exercise police were on the ground within a month but only </p>
<p>following a great deal of effort.”</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Following a Cabinet meeting on 10 April, Mr David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, </p>
<p>told officials that he wanted to be in a position to offer, or react very quickly to a request </p>
<p>for, assistance in re&#8209;establishing policing in Iraq.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> He was reported to have been </p>
<p>thinking more of offering specialist advice than substantial numbers of police officers. </p>
<p><b>103. </b> Home Office officials were told by Mr Pattison that the FCO’s preferred approach </p>
<p>was to proceed with the initial deployment of a small MOD police contingent before </p>
<p>deciding whether to ask the Home Office for any assistance from other forces. </p>

<p>87</p>
<p><b>104. </b> Mr Blunkett was said to be “disappointed” by that response and told Mr Blair that </p>
<p>he was “very keen to make his own contribution”. He instructed his officials to make </p>
<p>contact with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to explore the possibilities, </p>
<p>which they did on 14 April. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Chief Constable Paul Kernaghan, the lead on international affairs for ACPO, </p>
<p>responded:</p>
<p>“ACPO and I are very keen to play a full and appropriate part in supporting the UK’s </p>
<p>contribution to liberating the people of Iraq. The form of assistance we can provide </p>
<p>depends on the mission envisaged and crucially clear political direction.”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Blunkett relayed CC Kernaghan’s offer to Mr Straw, confirming his own </p>
<p>“commitment to the rehabilitation of Iraq, and in particular to the principle of the provision </p>
<p>of UK policing assistance as soon as practicable”.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> Mr Blunkett emphasised that both </p>
<p>CC Kernaghan and he were “ready and willing to engage with you in working towards </p>
<p>identifying civilian policing requirements in Iraq and how they might best be met”. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> CC Kernaghan wrote to Mr Pattison, offering his services and suggesting that the </p>
<p>FCO might wish to convene a meeting to bring together the key players from the FCO, </p>
<p>Home Office and relevant policing interests to ensure a co&#8209;ordinated approach.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> He had </p>
<p>already discussed the matter with the Chief Constable of the MOD police and they were </p>
<p>“agreed that an integrated response between all elements of the UK police service is the </p>
<p>best approach”.</p>
<p><b>108. </b> On 23 April, a meeting between the FCO, the Home Office, the MOD and ACPO </p>
<p>agreed that the MOD police would deploy two officers – at the rank of Superintendent </p>
<p>and either Inspector or Chief Inspector – “to enhance the police advice available to </p>
<p>GOC [General Officer Commanding] 1 UK Armoured Division” and that the FCO would </p>
<p>try to place a UK Chief Inspector inside the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p>
<p>Assistance (ORHA).</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> It was confirmed that, in the meantime, CC Kernaghan should </p>
<p>visit Iraq to gather information “to enable FCO/ACPO/Home Office to plan the UK’s </p>
<p>contribution”. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> CC Kernaghan’s record of the meeting concluded that “at this point in time there is </p>
<p>no clear shared vision of the future but instead a strong determination by the agencies </p>
<p>represented to provide meaningful support based on a professional assessment of </p>
<p>the situation”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>110. </b> The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation (AHMGIR – see box later </p>
<p>in this Section) discussed an IPU paper on SSR on 8 May.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> No Home Office Minister </p>
<p>was available to attend the meeting but Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, did </p>
<p>attend. In advance of the meeting Mr Blunkett spoke to Lord Goldsmith and confirmed </p>
<p>the Home Office’s willingness to contribute resources and expertise to assist UK efforts </p>
<p>to shape SSR work in Iraq. They agreed that it would be useful for their two departments </p>
<p>to work together on the matter. </p>
<p><b>111. </b> The Home Office recognised that its potentially relevant expertise covered a range </p>
<p>of areas, including terrorism and security, immigration and asylum, drugs, policing </p>
<p>and prisons.</p>
<p><b>112. </b> Lord Goldsmith reported to the AHMGIR that he and Mr Blunkett were willing to </p>
<p>put more resources into helping the police and justice work in Iraq.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>113. </b> CC Kernaghan visited Iraq in late May.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> In his visit report he observed: “Effective </p>
<p>policing in Iraq requires operational officers to be armed.” Given that, and the fact that </p>
<p>the vast majority of police officers in the UK did not routinely carry firearms and so were </p>
<p>not trained in their use, he did not believe that they would be effective in an operational </p>
<p>role in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> CC Kernaghan thought that UK involvement in police training would be more </p>
<p>appropriate. He commented that the pressure to deploy police officers on operational </p>
<p>duties was likely to be immense.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Following an agreement for the UK to provide a Chief Constable to be the senior </p>
<p>policing adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) within the Iraqi Ministry </p>
<p>of Interior (MOI), on 6 June 2003 ACPO issued a notice advertising a secondment </p>
<p>opportunity for a senior UK police officer.</p>

<p><b>SSR across Iraq: after the invasion</b></p>

<p>and the events that followed it in Section 9.1. The start of efforts to reconstruct Iraq is set </p>
<p>out in Section 10.1. </p>
<p><b>117. </b> Shortly after the start of Operation TELIC,</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> the IPU circulated a “core script” on </p>

<p>89</p>
<p>media interest grew.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> Until that point, the Government had been “reluctant” to discuss </p>
<p>openly how post&#8209;conflict Iraq would be managed, but this was to be given greater </p>
<p>prominence as military action began. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> The script was also circulated to all Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates </p>
<p>to aid the briefing of “key contacts”.</p>

<p><b>120. </b> Lt Gen Reith updated the Chiefs of Staff on Phase IV planning on 21 March.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He warned that Phase IV delivery remained subject to “uncertain US dynamics at the </p>
<p>pol/mil [politico&#8209;military] level” and identified a number of key issues that still required </p>
<p>resolution (see Section 6.5), including how to approach SSR.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Bowen circulated a draft paper to senior officials in the FCO, MOD and DFID on </p>
<p>25 March that set out “British Post&#8209;Conflict Objectives” (see Section 9.1).</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> On SSR, the </p>
<p>draft stated that the UK would, with others, assist reform in Iraq by: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the observance of human rights, and legal and judicial reform; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping Iraq generate reformed and accountable security forces acting in </p>
<p>accordance with human rights standards.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> Mr Bowen suggested that officials should show the draft paper to their Ministers, </p>
<p>if they had not already done so: “We will then see the outcome of the Prime Ministerial </p>
<p>visit to Camp David and consider formal submission early next week.”</p>
<p><b>123. </b> The AHMGIR met on 10 April.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> Ministers agreed that the UK should participate </p>
<p>in work being done by the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs (ORHA), </p>
<p>headed by retired US Lieutenant General Jay Garner. The UK should lead a group on </p>
<p>security sector management and planning for SSR.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>124. </b> On 14 April, Mr Blair told the House of Commons that:</p>
<p>“… around 2,000 police officers have reported for work, there are some joint patrols </p>
<p>in being and the head of the civil police department, not to be confused with the </p>
<p>special security forces, has ordered police to return to work.” </p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>125. </b> In a conversation with President Bush on 14 April, Mr Blair stated that the Iraqi </p>
<p>police clearly needed to be re&#8209;organised and deployed.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> There could be a role for </p>
<p>foreign police contingents.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief US Central Command (CENTCOM), </p>
<p>issued his ‘Freedom Message to the Iraqi People’ on 16 April 2003.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> It instructed the </p>
<p>Iraqi armed forces and security organisations to:</p>
<p>“… lay down their arms … and … obey the orders of the nearest Coalition military </p>
<p>commander. All other Iraqis should continue their normal daily activities; officials </p>
<p>should report to their places of work until told otherwise.”</p>
<p><b>127. </b> On 21 April, OHRA entered Iraq.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>128. </b> In late April, the UK AO was declared “permissive”, first by UK forces on </p>
<p>22 April</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> and a few days later by the UN Security Co&#8209;ordinator.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> The Coalition defined </p>
<p>“permissive” environments as ones to which humanitarian assistance organisations </p>
<p>could have access, although they should use all precautionary measures and notify the </p>
<p>Coalition Forces.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>129. </b> Section 8 describes the evolution of the boundaries of the UK AO. On </p>
<p>24 April, Ministers agreed that “the size of the UK military sector will depend on the </p>
<p>permissiveness of the environment and the extent of other nations’ contributions, but </p>
<p>the current assumption was that it would comprise four, or possibly five provinces in </p>
<p>the South”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>130. </b> As Occupying Power in those provinces, the UK had responsibility for the provision </p>

<p>91</p>
<p><b>Resolution 1483</b></p>
<p>Resolution 1483 was adopted on 22 May 2003.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> In relation to security and SSR, the </p>
<p>Security Council called upon the Coalition to: </p>
<p>“… promote the welfare of the Iraqi people through the effective administration of </p>
<p>the territory, including in particular working towards the restoration of conditions of </p>
<p>security and stability and the creation of conditions in which the Iraqi people can </p>
<p>freely determine their own political future.”</p>
<p>Resolution 1483 also provided for a UN Special Representative who would, in </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordination with the Coalition, encourage “international efforts to rebuild the capacity of </p>
<p>the Iraqi civilian police force” and “promote legal and judicial reforms”.</p>
<p><b>131. </b> The report of a visit to Iraq by DFID officials described how the “justice and </p>
<p>security teams” within ORHA had: </p>
<p>“… drawn up extensive plans covering law and order, transitional justice, longer </p>
<p>term institutional reform in the justice sector and limited DDR. Justice sector plans </p>
<p>have been developed over two years, are well thought through and, with the </p>
<p>requisite UN authority, would provide an excellent basis for future work. The likely </p>
<p>breakdown in public administration and the implications for law and order were </p>
<p>identified before the Iraq conflict began. Unfortunately, this advice was disregarded </p>
<p>by the US Administration and the Coalition military.” </p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>132. </b> The AHMGIR met on 24 April.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> In discussion, it was stated that the UK had </p>
<p>“plenty of good expertise on Security Sector Reform and should play a prominent role”. </p>
<p>Ministers agreed that the UK should lobby the US to create a “comprehensive strategy” </p>
<p>and to involve UK personnel in ORHA scoping studies. There was no attendee from the </p>
<p>Home Office. </p>
<p><b>133. </b> Ministers also agreed that UK forces should continue to exercise a policing function </p>
<p>while attempting to revive the local police forces and courts. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> On 2 May, ORHA issued a call to all Baghdad employees of the MOI, the IPS, </p>

<p>92</p>
<p><b>135. </b> On 6 May, President Bush announced the appointment of Ambassador Paul </p>
<p>Bremer as the Presidential Envoy to Iraq and head of the CPA (see Section 9.1).</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The CPA quickly subsumed ORHA, retaining many of its staff.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>136. </b> Within the CPA, Ambassador Bremer’s Senior Adviser for National Security and </p>
<p>Defense was Mr Walt Slocombe.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> A former New York City Police Commissioner, </p>
<p>Mr Bernard Kerik, became the CPA’s senior adviser to the MOI.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> On 6 May, Mr Straw announced to Parliament that Mr John Sawers had been </p>
<p>appointed as the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq:</p>
<p>“Mr Sawers will work alongside Chris Segar, head of the newly opened British office </p>
<p>in Baghdad, particularly in relation to the political process and our work in the Office </p>
<p>of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance.” </p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>138. </b> On 8 May the AHMGIR discussed a paper on SSR produced by the IPU.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper stated:</p>
<p>“Reform across the full range of security activities (armed forces, intelligence </p>
<p>agencies, justice and law enforcement institutions) is an essential element of the </p>
<p>overall Coalition strategy to establish a united and representative Iraqi Government </p>
<p>and to create the conditions under which the Coalition can eventually disengage.</p>
<p>“The objective must be the transformation of Iraq’s security institutions so that </p>
<p>they play an effective, legitimate and democratically accountable role in providing </p>
<p>external and internal security for Iraq’s citizens … UK experience suggests that </p>
<p>a coherent strategy will need effective burden sharing and … the extended </p>
<p>involvement of NGOs and other SSR actors. Immediate decisions and urgent action </p>
<p>is needed to deal with the potential problems of unemployed and disaffected military </p>
<p>and security service personnel.”</p>
<p><b>139. </b> The paper described the US approach as “embryonic” and assessed that it “tends </p>
<p>to approach elements of the security sector separately”. It also stated that “we must </p>
<p>recognise that influencing US views may prove difficult, and will undoubtedly require </p>
<p>considerable and sustained effort”.</p>
<p><b>140. </b> The paper reported that Mr Slocombe was assembling a team to deploy to Iraq </p>
<p>later that month to establish the “Office of the Senior Advisor for the Ministry of Defence </p>
<p>Iraq and the Iraqi National Defence Force”. He was reported to be “actively seeking </p>

<p>110</p>
<p> The immediate UK priorities were therefore aimed </p>
<p>at seeking to influence the development of US policy. Although the paper recommended </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>UK personnel should be deployed, including the creation of an SSR secretariat </p>
<p>within ORHA, to advise on cross&#8209;cutting SSR issues.</p>

<p>112</p>
<p> It also placed individuals in senior </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>147. </b> In a meeting with Ambassador Bremer and Mr Sawers on 16 May, some of the </p>
<p>Iraqi leaders present argued that the scope of the recently announced de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>policy should be “broadened to include the security services and army, private </p>
<p>companies set up under Saddam, and the media”.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> Bremer promised that there would </p>
<p>be a further proclamation on the security services and army in the days ahead. </p>
<p><b>148. </b> On 23 May, CPA Order No.2 – “Dissolution of Entities” – “dissolved” (or disbanded) </p>
<p>a number of military and other security entities that had operated as part of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> The dissolved entities included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the government ministries responsible for Defence, Information and Military </p>
<p>Affairs; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the intelligence agencies; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the armed forces; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the paramilitary forces which were closely associated with Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p><b>149. </b> CPA Order No.2 also stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>military ranks were cancelled;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>conscripts were released; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a termination payment would be paid to those dismissed, except to senior party </p>
<p>members; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pensions would continue to be paid, except to senior party members.</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Neither the IPS nor the MOI were dissolved. Reflecting on the Order several years </p>
<p>later, Ambassador Bremer wrote in the <i>New York Times</i> that the “police force, which we </p>
<p>did recall to duty, has proven unreliable and is mistrusted by the very Iraqi people it is </p>
<p>supposed to protect”.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>151. </b> In his book <i>State of Denial</i>, Mr Bob Woodward suggested that an early draft of the </p>
<p>Order had proposed disbanding the MOI.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> At Lt Gen Garner’s suggestion, that had not </p>
<p>been implemented, in order to preserve the IPS who were employed by the MOI.</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Existing members of the organisations listed above were dismissed from their </p>
<p>former employment, with effect from 16 April (the date of Gen Franks’ declaration).</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Order No.2 also announced:</p>
<p>“The CPA plans to create in the near future a New Iraqi Corps,</p>

<p>121</p>
<p><b>154. </b> There was nothing in CPA Order No.2 that prevented former employees of the </p>

<p><b>155. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i>, the account of US involvement in Iraq by the US Special Inspector </p>
<p>General for Iraq Reconstruction, records that Order No.2 was drafted by Mr Slocombe.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>156. </b> In a 2004 interview, Mr Slocombe observed that the reasons for disbanding the </p>
<p>Iraqi Army were both political and practical: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Army had effectively disappeared after the invasion and its barracks had </p>
<p>been heavily looted: “We didn’t disband the army. The army disbanded itself … </p>
<p>Furthermore, even if they had come back … all the facilities were trashed.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The structure of the former Iraqi Army was such that it would have required </p>
<p>substantial reform to be a suitable modern army: “… it was a conscript army </p>
<p>with overwhelmingly Shia conscripts and overwhelmingly Sunni officers … </p>
<p>The Iraqi Army had 11,000 general officers. The American Army … has </p>
<p>300 general officers.” </p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Lieutenant General Jonathon Riley, who served in Baghdad in 2003 as Deputy </p>
<p>Head of the Coalition Military Assistance Training Team (CMATT), told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>the CPA was left with no choice but to disband the army:</p>
<p>“He [Ambassador Bremer] is criticised for doing it, but I believe that by the time </p>
<p>he made that decree, the army had disbanded itself and what was left of its </p>
<p>infrastructure had been largely torn apart by the population, which had lost all </p>
<p>respect for its own army. A very bad situation to be in.”</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>158. </b> According to the RAND Report, <i>After Saddam: Pre&#8209;war Planning and the </i></p>
<p><i>Occupation of Iraq</i>:</p>
<p>“… the decision to disband the Iraqi armed forces was … made in Washington … </p>
<p>in early May 2003, before the deployment of Ambassador L Paul Bremer to </p>
<p>Baghdad.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr Douglas Feith, the former US Under Secretary for Defense and Policy, </p>
<p>recorded in his memoir that he had been briefed by Ambassador Bremer and </p>
<p>Mr Slocombe on 9 May 2003 about “their plan to dissolve the Iraqi Army”.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>160. </b> According to <i>Hard Lessons</i>, the US Department of Defense (DoD) had not </p>
<p>discussed the Order with senior officials from other US agencies before approving it.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secretary Powell recalled that “There was no meeting on it; there was no, ‘Gee, is this </p>
<p>a good idea?’ You couldn’t even tell who had decided it.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Major General Tim Cross, a senior secondee to ORHA, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>the decision to demobilise the army had been made “against all advice from Garner </p>
<p>and myself”.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>162. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary between 2001 and 2005, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was not aware of any discussion with us, with the UK, before those judgements </p>
<p>were taken. After they were taken, the Americans said to us … that it had to happen </p>
<p>anyway, because the army had disappeared. Well, true, but not the 10,000 officers. </p>
<p>So I didn’t quite buy that.”</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Ambassador Bremer had specifically raised the issue of “dissolving the MOD and </p>
<p>the security and intelligence organisations” and “establish[ing] a new national army” </p>
<p>in his first meeting with Mr Sawers on 12 May.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> Mr Sawers had not expressed any </p>
<p>concerns and commented that Ambassador Bremer had made a “good dynamic start”. </p>
<p><b>164. </b> Mr Slocombe met Mr Hoon in London on 13 May.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> Mr Slocombe produced a </p>
<p>record of this meeting for Ambassador Bremer (a leaked copy of which has appeared </p>
<p>on the internet), which stated:</p>
<p>“If some UK officers or officials think we should try to rebuild and reassemble the old </p>
<p>RA [regular army] they did not give any hint of it …”</p>
<p><b>165. </b> The MOD record of Mr Hoon’s meeting with Mr Slocombe on 13 May stated that </p>
<p>Mr Slocombe had: </p>
<p>“… outlined … the plans for … the new Iraqi Armed Force. He emphasised that this </p>
<p>would be a new Army, rather than a reconstituted version of the old.”</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>166. </b> There is nothing in the record to suggest that Mr Hoon or those accompanying him </p>
<p>raised any concerns.</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Mr Hoon offered UK support with the training of the NIA and stated that it was </p>
<p>important that police reform took place in the context of a wider SSR process, “including </p>
<p>lawyers, judges, prison officers”.</p>
<p><b>168. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Simon Webb, MOD Policy Director, about the meeting.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Webb said that he had expected the Iraqi Army to be retained and reformed but </p>
<p>observed:</p>
<p>“Of course, life then became particularly complicated when the army disappeared, </p>
<p>because of course Saddam [Hussein] had himself … dispersed the army so that it </p>
<p>couldn’t become a political threat to him. Under this … strange command structure </p>
<p>he had introduced in 2002, the army just … gave up and went away. So when </p>
<p>Walt Slocombe showed up … it seemed a bit odd to … summon the army back in </p>
<p>again when you knew that actually you really wanted a rather different army from </p>
<p>a democratisation point of view.”</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Mr Ian Lee, MOD Director General Operational Policy, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>although he had met Mr Slocombe when the latter visited London in May 2003, he did </p>
<p>not recall a discussion on the disbandment of the Iraqi military.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>170. </b> The Chiefs of Staff met on 14 May.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> Minutes of the meeting recorded that “the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification process was anticipated to render all those officials senior to the rank </p>
<p>of Lieutenant Colonel as ‘out of play’”. No concerns about that were recorded, nor do </p>
<p>the minutes contain any mention of concern about Mr Slocombe’s plan to rebuild the </p>
<p>Iraqi Army from scratch.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Adm Boyce told the Inquiry that he had “laid down … that we should not … </p>
<p>go through de&#8209;Ba’athification or indeed disband the Iraqi Army. I saw that as being </p>
<p>absolutely essential for the future.”</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry about the impact of dissolving Iraqi military and </p>
<p>security entities:</p>
<p>“… these were policies that added to the difficulties, because we might have </p>
<p>addressed the security vacuum by trying to encourage Iraqi police, Iraqi military, to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate with us, instead of which, they are disbanded and then become natural </p>
<p>dissidents and potential insurgents.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>173. </b> That view was shared by Mr Hoon, who told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… some of the security difficulties, particularly in and around Baghdad were the </p>
<p>result of disaffected people, no longer receiving their salary, joining the insurgency </p>
<p>and, indeed, putting their expertise to use in the sense that there was a clear </p>
<p>suggestion to me that some of the attacks became more sophisticated as some </p>
<p>[former] military people became involved … </p>
<p>“… I think that it would have been better to have that stability in that immediate </p>
<p>aftermath and I think that, to some extent, disbanding the army fuelled the </p>
<p>insurgency in a way that made it much harder to contain.”</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I don’t think it is credible to lay the insurgency, the roots of the insurgency, in the </p>
<p>decision to disband the army … The decision to formally disband the army was not </p>
<p>something that inspired or triggered the insurgency. It may, in some areas, have </p>
<p>compounded it, but it wasn’t the fundamental reason behind it.”</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>175. </b> The Order to disband the army also reduced the rate at which the security forces </p>
<p>were later re&#8209;established. General Sir John Reith told the Inquiry that if the army had not </p>
<p>been disbanded “there was still some structure there we could have built on, whereas, </p>
<p>as it was, we really had to start from scratch”.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely, who became Senior British Military </p>
<p>Representative – Iraq (SBMR&#8209;I) in October 2004, described the impact on army </p>
<p>capability: </p>
<p>“The Iraqi Army, of course, as a result of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s </p>
<p>decision to disband the army, had been starting from scratch in many areas. So the </p>
<p>competence of commanders was in many cases way below that which you would </p>
<p>expect of their rank.”</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>177. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations from </p>
<p>May 2003 to July 2003, told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… one advantage that the Iraqi Army has had subsequently over the Iraqi police </p>
<p>force is that it was created ab initio and thus did not contain some of the flaws that </p>
<p>manifested themselves in the Iraqi police force in subsequent years.”</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Mr Sawers had reported to the FCO in London on 20 May that the question of </p>
<p>“what to do about military pay and pensions” was one of the “problems in the pipeline”.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No further details were provided.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Maj Gen Cross prepared a note for Mr Blair on 22 May setting out some points to </p>
<p>make in a forthcoming discussion with President Bush.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> Those included a reference to </p>
<p>the recent de&#8209;Ba’athification announcement having “created some inevitable difficulties”. </p>
<p><b>180. </b> Maj Gen Cross also raised a concern about what he understood to be the </p>
<p>emerging policy decision not to pay pensions to former military personnel. He </p>
<p>commented that “there are dangers in excluding such a large and possibly well armed </p>
<p>group” from arrangements that were to apply to other members of the public sector.</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Although no details of the amount of that payment and the arrangements for </p>
<p>receiving it were given in the Order itself, those dismissed by CPA Order No.2 were </p>
<p>entitled to a termination payment (unless they were a “Senior Party Member” within the </p>
<p>terms of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Order).</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> Those who had previously been receiving a </p>
<p>pension from one of the dissolved organisations would continue to receive that pension </p>
<p>(again, unless they were a “Senior Party Member”).</p>
<p><b>182. </b> A telegram from FCO London to Washington, dated 30 May, identified the problem </p>
<p>of large numbers of people (and in particular those with military training) out of work and </p>
<p>without prospect of further employment.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> The FCO commented: </p>
<p>“… the Coalition needs a policy to reduce the perverse incentives for … [that group] </p>
<p>to drift towards the hard core actively opposing the Coalition … one solution might </p>
<p>be to create a workfare scheme – a pool of labour drawn specifically from those left </p>
<p>unemployed by the disbandment of the security apparatus, to meet urgent short </p>
<p>term requirements … </p>
<p>“In the medium term, Security Sector Reform (SSR) will make a significant </p>
<p>contribution to resolving this issue.”</p>
<p><b>183. </b> An alternative proposal for re&#8209;employing former army personnel was put forward </p>
<p>by the Cabinet Office in the Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR on 12 June.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> Officials </p>

<p>149</p>
<p> Mr Sawers’ own view was that the sums being proposed </p>
<p>“may not be enough to solve the problem”, adding:</p>
<p>“Bremer has an open mind on this, though does not want to burden a future Iraqi </p>
<p>Government more than necessary, nor be more generous to ex&#8209;soldiers than to </p>
<p>civilians … At a meeting with leading Iraqis today Bremer sought views on how </p>
<p>to deal with the ex&#8209;military. The great majority of those present – including Shia </p>
<p>Islamists – argued that regular payments should be made to ease the security threat </p>

<p>Mr Blair that: “Baghdad remains key; and the key to Baghdad is security.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> Sir David’s </p>
<p>view was that:</p>
<p>“Police training could have a disproportionate impact. (Police are conspicuous by </p>

<p>the task of providing police training for six weeks.”</p>

<p><b>190. </b> The proposal to deploy 16 Air Assault Brigade was supported by Major General </p>
<p>David Richards, the Assistant Chief of the General Staff, who had been sent to Iraq by </p>
<p>Mr Hoon and General Sir Michael Walker, CDS, to scope the potential for a UK role in </p>
<p>improving SSR.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>191. </b> The deployment was also encouraged by Mr Sawers, who emphasised the </p>
<p>strategic importance of taking action in the immediate future to avoid further deterioration </p>
<p>in security.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>192. </b> On 23 May, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary, wrote to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning to explain that the MOD advised against the deployment to Baghdad, on the </p>
<p>basis that it was “likely to have only a marginal effect” and might divert effort away from </p>
<p>the South of Iraq, where the UK was seeking to implement an “exemplary approach”.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>193. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed SSR on 29 May, when they considered a paper </p>
<p>prepared by the SPG.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> The paper had been circulated to the FCO and the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office, though not to DFID, the Home Office or other departments with responsibility for </p>
<p>wider security or justice issues.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>194. </b> The SPG defined SSR as addressing “all aspects of the security sector (police, </p>
<p>judiciary, penal service, border security, intelligence services and armed forces) as part </p>
<p>of a long term holistic programme of change”. Although SSR was normally led by DFID, </p>
<p>with the MOD, the FCO and the Home Office as stakeholders, for Iraq the IPU had been </p>
<p>given the lead “for the development of UK strategy through the Cabinet Office”. </p>
<p><b>195. </b> The SPG recognised that SSR in Iraq was part of both the security and </p>
<p>reconstruction efforts, and defined the SSR goal for Phase IV as:</p>
<p>“To establish as soon as possible the core elements of a legitimate, accountable, </p>
<p>sustainable Security Sector – which safeguards the Rights of Citizens and provides </p>
<p>adequate Defence of future Iraqi Sovereignty.”</p>
<p><b>196. </b> The paper concluded with an assessment of the level of UK military resource </p>
<p>that should be devoted to that task, commenting that “we may face a requirement to </p>
<p>provide additional resources” and that there was “a choice about the degree of military </p>
<p>involvement” which would “have implications for both the level [sic] resources and the </p>
<p>length of time we are likely to be engaged”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>197. </b> In the area of Iraq under UK control, UK forces were “likely to be faced with a </p>
<p>variety of low level military activities required of Coalition Forces by the US to enable </p>
<p>SSR implementation (e.g. oversight of recruiting procedures, provision of training advice </p>
<p>and resources)”. </p>
<p><b>198. </b> The SPG’s recommendations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We should proceed on the basis of minimal engagement in SSR in Iraq </p>
<p>coherent with current Ministerial intent.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We should seek clarification of where the funding for engagement in SSR will </p>
<p>be forthcoming.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That the UK should seek clarification from the US on “who will decide size and </p>
<p>shape of internal security forces”. </p>
<p><b>199. </b> The minutes of the Chiefs of Staff meeting recorded that the MOD “should remain </p>
<p>flexible on the degree to which the UK should be militarily involved, but be forward </p>
<p>leaning in those areas where valuable assistance could be offered.”</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>The police structure in the UK</b></p>
<p>In his statement to the Inquiry, Chief Constable Paul Kernaghan described the police </p>
<p>structure in the UK during the Iraq conflict.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> There were 52 territorial forces: the Home </p>
<p>Office was responsible for the 43 forces that cover England and Wales, the Scottish </p>
<p>Executive for the eight forces in Scotland and the Northern Ireland Office for the Police </p>
<p>Service in Northern Ireland (PSNI). Each force was headed by a Chief Constable (or </p>
<p>Commissioner), who were members of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within ACPO, discrete “business areas” were led by individual Chief Constables “in </p>
<p>addition to other duties”.</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2008, CC Kernaghan was the lead on international affairs for ACPO in </p>
<p>addition to his role as Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> CC Kernaghan had first been informed of a potential requirement to deploy </p>
<p>police officers to Iraq in an email from a junior Home Office official on 14 April.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That exchange is also referred to earlier in this Section. The junior official explained:</p>
<p>“As you know, we would expect the FCO, who lead on the UK contribution to the </p>
<p>policing element of international peacekeeping/crisis management operations, </p>
<p>to initiate any request for policing assistance in Iraq. No formal approach has yet </p>
<p>been made. But in view of the Home Secretary’s keen interest, I spoke to Stephen </p>
<p>Pattison, Head of the UN Department at the FCO, to find out what their thinking was. </p>

<p>He considers that an initial, fairly small, deployment of armed police officers to Basra </p>
<p>would be useful in the first instance. The idea being that they would seek out credible </p>
<p>elements of the local police force and encourage them (e.g. to act against looters etc).</p>
<p>“To meet this requirement, the International Policing Unit was looking to recruit about </p>
<p>20 Ministry of Defence Police officers, after the MDP [Ministry of Defence Police] </p>
<p>had made a short reconnaissance visit … Stephen Pattison said that he would like </p>
<p>to see how this initiative worked out, before deciding whether to ask the HO [Home </p>
<p>Office] for any assistance from other (i.e. ACPO) forces.” </p>
<p><b>201. </b> In his response CC Kernaghan asked a number of questions about how the UK </p>
<p>government envisaged any civilian policing assistance fitting in with the current military </p>
<p>role and volunteered to visit Iraq “to consult with appropriate Coalition commanders/</p>
<p>administrators and assess the input the UK could make”.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>202. </b> CC Kernaghan told the Inquiry that he was “quite clear” that he could not </p>
<p>offer valid professional advice unless he had “first hand exposure to the realities of </p>
<p>contemporary Iraq”.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>203. </b> On 23 May, CC Kernaghan reported to Mr Blunkett and Mr Straw on his visit </p>
<p>to Iraq the previous week, undertaken to assess the possibilities for a UK police </p>
<p>contribution to the Coalition effort and the scale of the task involved.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> CC Kernaghan </p>
<p>identified a number of challenges that he judged the Coalition powers would need to </p>
<p>overcome in order to deliver effective law and order within Iraq: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The absence of strategic direction or professionally informed planning. As well </p>
<p>as the disorganisation he encountered in ORHA (which he attributed in part to </p>
<p>the transition to the CPA), CC Kernaghan highlighted the absence of a clear </p>
<p>plan from either of the two Occupying Powers for maintaining law and order or </p>
<p>operating an effective criminal justice system. He observed that, in the course </p>
<p>of his visit, it had become apparent that the UK had been preparing for the </p>
<p>potential Occupation for some time and stated that it was a matter of “regret” </p>
<p>that professional police advice from the UK had not been sought until April 2003.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Criminal justice infrastructure was “totally degraded with police stations, </p>
<p>courthouses and prisons having been looted by the local population and in some </p>
<p>cases their own staff”. CC Kernaghan commented that: “Looting does not do </p>
<p>justice to the level of destruction inflicted and I can best liken the outcome to the </p>
<p>progress of locusts across a field of corn.” He suggested that a prison facility </p>
<p>“meeting minimum international standards was also a high priority” and that </p>
<p>the old Iraqi prison facilities that had been discovered indicated that “humane </p>

<p>treatment of prisoners was an unknown concept.” Prisoners were, at the time, </p>
<p>being held in the theatre internment facility designed for prisoners of war. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The difference between the social norms and attitudes of the Occupying Powers </p>
<p>and the local people and their neighbours in the wider region. That divergence </p>
<p>was going to be a significant issue: “If the [Coalition Powers] are going to ensure </p>
<p>that their values and concept of human rights are respected in Iraq, excellent. </p>
<p>Equally, if they feel that legally they cannot change Iraqi society on those lines, </p>
<p>it would be helpful for that reality to be spelt out. This is particularly relevant to </p>
<p>policing, as any international officer serving in Iraq could not be associated with </p>
<p>operational policing which did not reflect the human rights position of their parent </p>
<p>country. Ambiguity and obfuscation would not survive long in the glare of media </p>
<p>and domestic political scrutiny.”</p>
<p><b>204. </b> After returning to the UK from a visit to Iraq, Mr Blair sent a personal note to </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> Sir David Manning provided copies to Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, Mr Watkins </p>
<p>and Mr Powell, but instructed “It must not go wider”.</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Blair wrote that:</p>
<p>“… the task is absolutely awesome and I’m not at all sure we’re geared for it. This is </p>
<p>worse than re&#8209;building a country from scratch.”</p>
<p><b>206. </b> He went on to explain that security in Baghdad had to be dealt with at once; police </p>
<p>training was vital and urgent. </p>
<p><b>207. </b> During May, the CPA Interior Ministry’s International Police Assistance Team (IPAT) </p>
<p>– comprising 15 policing experts from the UK, US, Canada and Denmark – carried </p>
<p>out an assessment of the Iraqi police, to inform the CPA’s plans for reconstituting and </p>
<p>developing policing in Iraq.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> The Coalition had originally intended to conduct the </p>
<p>policing assessment as part of a wider justice sector assessment; however, because </p>
<p>“the law and order situation was in a critical state of disarray … the … priority was </p>
<p>defined as establishing the police forces” and the work on policing was taken forward in </p>
<p>advance of wider work on the justice sector. The team produced a 56&#8209;page assessment </p>
<p>of the state and future of policing in Iraq on 30 May. </p>
<p><b>208. </b> The IPAT assessed that the law and order situation varied across Iraq. It </p>
<p>explained that the arrangements for recalling and reinstating the Iraqi police had varied </p>
<p>geographically and that individual Coalition commanders had taken different approaches </p>
<p>to the training and re&#8209;use of existing police: </p>
<p>“This effectively began the creation of four potentially different police forces in Iraq: </p>
<p>North, Central, South Central and South.” </p>

<p><b>209. </b> The IPAT commented: </p>
<p>“Encouragingly, the Iraqi police are co&#8209;operating and demonstrating a willingness to </p>
<p>work alongside the Coalition Forces in order to address the law and order situation.”</p>
<p><b>210. </b> The IPAT explained that ORHA had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>issued guidelines “to ensure that a standardised approach is utilised while </p>
<p>re&#8209;organising the police within each military area of responsibility”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>established “criteria for vetting existing and screening newly recruited </p>
<p>personnel”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that programmes of instruction to re&#8209;train all existing personnel and new </p>
<p>recruits would be complete by mid&#8209;June; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increased salary levels; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>begun vetting of senior police officers in response to the de&#8209;Ba’athification Order. </p>
<p><b>211. </b> The IPAT assessment concluded: </p>
<p>“The Iraqi Police, as currently constituted and trained, are unable to independently </p>
<p>maintain law and order and need the assistance and guidance of Coalition Force </p>
<p>assets (or some similar follow on force) to accomplish this task.”</p>
<p><b>212. </b> The Iraqi police would need to be “redesigned and redeveloped” if they were to </p>
<p>become capable of engendering public trust and confidence and being able to recover </p>
<p>from the “years of neglect” and the “repressive command structure” that prohibited </p>
<p>training, proactivity and initiative. </p>
<p><b>213. </b> The IPAT recommended demilitarising the structure and ethos of the police and, </p>
<p>while it recommended that the new police force should be recruited primarily from those </p>
<p>who served in the previous Iraqi police, there should be tight vetting arrangements, </p>
<p>retraining and “the establishment of an aggressive Office of Professional Standards … </p>
<p>that ferrets out corruption while immediately addressing unprofessional, unethical or </p>
<p>criminal behaviour within the Service”. </p>
<p><b>214. </b> The IPAT set out a summary of the principles to be applied to vetting. It explained </p>
<p>that the purpose was both “to remove unacceptable personnel from the existing … </p>
<p>service” and to prevent unsuitable individuals joining the reconstituted police service. </p>
<p>In addition to physical fitness and basic Arabic literacy, the criteria included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No affiliation with the Ba’ath Party in accordance with … CPA Order No.1;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No reported history of human rights violations or history of mistreatment or </p>
<p>abuse of other persons;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No criminal history involving violence, theft or violating the public trust;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No reported history of a propensity to engage in violence or criminal acts; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No reported history of immoral or unethical activity.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>215. </b> The IPAT explained that once applicants had met those minimum requirements, </p>
<p>they would be investigated in line with the de&#8209;Ba’athification Order to check that they </p>
<p>were not disqualified from employment. Absolute disqualifications would include: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Former regime security organisation affiliation (RG [Republican Guard] or worse); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Senior Ba’ath Party membership; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Terrorist organisation affiliation; or </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Human rights violations and crimes against humanity.”</p>
<p><b>216. </b> The IPAT did not provide any details of how the information on which to make </p>
<p>judgements about individual cases was to be obtained and evaluated. Nor was there any </p>
<p>information about who would make the judgements. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> Training programmes for existing police officers were to comprise an initial </p>
<p>three&#8209;week transitional training programme followed by a longer&#8209;term capacity&#8209;building </p>
<p>programme, to include monitoring and mentoring, “until an effective, locally acceptable </p>
<p>police force is established that incorporates principles of community policing and full </p>
<p>respect for the human rights of individuals”.</p>
<p><b>218. </b> The IPAT assessed that that could not be achieved “without significant international </p>
<p>assistance” and estimated that “a requisite force” would comprise 6,633</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> international </p>
<p>police advisers, an unspecified number of whom would have executive powers. Training </p>
<p>sites should be opened in Baghdad, Basra, al&#8209;Anbar and Northern Iraq. Those whom the </p>
<p>IPAT had spoken to as part of its research had “expressed a wish for US and UK police </p>
<p>as trainers and supervisors”, though the IPAT was of the opinion that “consideration </p>
<p>should obviously be given to a wider pool than this and should also include consideration </p>
<p>of other Arab police forces”. There was no detail about how those advisers would be </p>
<p>sourced. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> The IPAT stated: </p>
<p>“… a policy decision is needed as to the end state of the police … so that there is </p>
<p>an overarching vision and focus … Two models are available. One is the classic </p>
<p>single national police force with specialised units at the centre and decentralised </p>
<p>administration. The second is a police force which reflects a federal government </p>
<p>structure.”</p>
<p><b>220. </b> Former Deputy Chief Constable (DCC) Douglas Brand, who served as the UK’s </p>
<p>senior policing representative in Baghdad from July 2003, told the Inquiry that he </p>
<p>recalled seeing the IPAT assessment prior to his deployment and thought that it was </p>
<p>“high on aspiration but very low on actual, practical capability … not least, there wasn’t </p>
<p>a great deal of understanding of the local culture and context”.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>168 </p>
<p>The report quotes two figures; 6,663 and 6,633. The Inquiry believes the latter is the correct figure.</p>

<p>passports, citizenship and disaster relief and Mr Slocombe focused on the development </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Armed Forces.</p>
<p>179 </p>
<p>Mr Kerik’s team at this stage comprised 12 people with an </p>
<p>additional five consultants on short&#8209;term assignments. </p>
<p><b>228. </b> A record of the IPU’s SSR team’s visit to Iraq at the start of July stated:</p>
<p>“Although Kerik has a clear vision on his aspirations for a police force there currently </p>
<p>appears to be a lack of strategic direction for the whole of Iraq with his focus firmly </p>
<p>on Baghdad. That said it is understood that guidance has been given to the regions </p>
<p>but they have largely been left to fend for themselves. It is expected that this will </p>
<p>change as the international policing effort is established. Kerik offered much praise </p>
<p>for the efforts and progress made in the Basra area by UK forces.” </p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>UK policing strategy: summer 2003</b></p>
<p><b>229. </b> On 5 June, Mr Straw sent a number of papers to Mr Blair including a three&#8209;page </p>
<p>policing strategy produced by the UND.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> It referenced the CPA’s assessment of 30 May </p>
<p>and commented that, in the FCO’s view, the immediate objective was “to stabilise the </p>
<p>security situation by creating an effective interim police force with international civilian </p>
<p>police working alongside Iraqi police and Coalition military forces”. </p>
<p><b>230. </b> The strategy stated that the longer&#8209;term objective was “to establish an effective, </p>
<p>viable and sustainable police force within a fully functioning security sector”. The initial </p>
<p>response would be deployment of “an armed International Police Monitoring Force … </p>
<p>to Baghdad and Basra, to conduct joint patrols with the current Iraqi police force and </p>
<p>Coalition military” requiring 3,000 armed police officers. Once the Iraqi police were </p>
<p>considered to have received sufficient initial training, the international presence would </p>
<p>have a longer&#8209;term training focus, eventually taking on a mentoring role. </p>
<p><b>231. </b> The UND paper suggested the following timetable:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By 14 June: CPA/Coalition agree strategy for reforming Iraq Police Force </p>
<p>[to include a decision on the model of police force required];</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By 21 June: Appointment of Police Commissioner to implement strategy; </p>

<p>109</p>
<p><b>232. </b> An FCO update to the MOD’s Iraq Secretariat stated that the strategy was “broadly </p>
<p>endorsed by the Prime Minister”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>233. </b> On 6 June, the UND contacted the US State Department to share its draft policing </p>
<p>strategy.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit and Gen Walker visited Baghdad and Basra in early June.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Kevin reported that Ambassador Bremer had expressed a desire to draw on </p>
<p>UK expertise from Northern Ireland and they had explored how the UK might offer </p>
<p>assistance. Sir Kevin also recorded that Gen Walker thought that the MOD Operational </p>
<p>Training and Advisory Group (OPTAG) should advise on the creation of a “Police and </p>
<p>Security Sector Reform Assistance” team.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> The UND responded with a formal minute defending the UK’s draft strategy. </p>
<p>The minute stated: </p>
<p>“Since 1997 there has been a Whitehall system in place for the deployment of UK </p>
<p>civilian police … The International Policing Unit in UND, FCO is in the lead … They </p>
<p>… have a large amount of experience and expertise to draw on. I do not see the </p>
<p>need to ask OPTAG to advise on setting up a new team … nor indeed do I see the </p>
<p>need for a new team to be set up at all.”</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>236. </b> The MOD’s Iraq Secretariat had also been in touch with Mr Kerik in Baghdad.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a result, they considered that the FCO’s policing strategy was “about three weeks </p>
<p>behind the curve” as Mr Kerik “doesn’t want an international force, he wants trainers </p>
<p>(about 7,000 of them).” </p>
<p><b>237. </b> The UND commented: </p>
<p>“Until we see a policing strategy from the Americans … I suggest we continue to sell </p>
<p>our proposal.” </p>
<p><b>238. </b> At the AHMGIR held on 12 June, the FCO’s policing strategy was not discussed.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead discussion on SSR focused on the deployment of UK personnel. </p>
<p><b>239. </b> The minutes also recorded: </p>
<p>“The US had asked for our advice on how to win hearts and minds and establish </p>
<p>security based on our Northern Ireland experience. The MOD would send a team.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>240. </b> The MOD deployed OPTAG to train US military trainers and “pass on UK expertise </p>
<p>in peace support operations” in June.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Andy Bearpark became the CPA Director of Operations and Director of </p>
<p>Operations and Infrastructure in June 2003. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The training of the new Iraqi police force was perceived of as an entirely civilian </p>
<p>lead, even though military resources might be required.”</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Straw met Ambassador Bremer in Iraq on 2 July.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> The record of the meeting </p>
<p>stated that Mr Kerik had made a request for “experienced police officers to help with </p>
<p>training and mentoring”. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> The nature of this request was clarified in the record of the IPU’s visit to Iraq in </p>
<p>early July, which stated:</p>
<p>“… a specific request for 100 UK Police Officers in a mentoring/tutoring role for the </p>
<p>next 18 months operating in Iraq was raised by Kerik.”</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>244. </b> Police secondees were expected to contribute in a range of areas including training </p>
<p>and mentoring, with some officers being expected to “have executive powers” (that is, to </p>
<p>be operational police officers).</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Acting DCC Brand deployed to Iraq on 4 July.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>246. </b> Before his deployment, the evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that there was </p>
<p>no clear understanding of what his role would be. There had “been a hint that the role </p>
<p>will be to head up the international policing effort”, but it was decided that he should </p>
<p>accompany the FCO’s SSR team on a visit to Baghdad and that “if there is a substantial </p>
<p>role for him it is intended that he will stay on”.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>247. </b> Former DCC Brand told the Inquiry that he had been “told that I should seek to </p>
<p>negotiate my way in with Bernard Kerik, but if that failed to return to the UK”.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>DFID officials summarised the conclusions and recommendations of the report as follows:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A holistic upgrade of legal competence was required. To practise under the </p>
<p>current system, lawyers needed only to register and attend a one&#8209;hour interview.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The roles of key actors in the court system needed clarification and re&#8209;definition: </p>
<p>specifically, prosecutors and defence lawyers should be more active and judges </p>
<p>should perform a less prosecutorial function.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The legal code should be clarified; choices needed to be made about which </p>
<p>statutes were valid and which were not.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Judges should be screened for Ba’ath Party status. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Legal associations needed to be strengthened to raise standards of </p>
<p>professionalism and self&#8209;regulation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Discrimination against women in the legal system was overwhelming. They were </p>
<p>not allowed to attend the judicial training course that was the basis for selection </p>
<p>as judges and prosecutors.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>The AHMGIR was briefed that some of the recommendations were already being put </p>
<p>into effect.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> On 17 June, Ambassador Bremer had announced the opening of a new </p>
<p>Iraqi Judicial College, the creation of a Judicial Review Committee (responsible for </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification of the judiciary) and the establishment of a Central Criminal Court. The </p>
<p>CPA also proposed to establish an Office of Human Rights and Transitional Justice, which </p>
<p>would operate alongside the Ministry of Justice. </p>
<p>Cabinet Office officials briefed members of the AHMGIR that: “We are generally content </p>
<p>with the direction of CPA policy, but believe that the UN and NGOs should be more </p>
<p>involved in the next stages.”</p>
<p>Ministers discussed the Judicial Review Team’s report at the AHMGIR on 26 June and </p>
<p>agreed that “subject to closer scrutiny” they should support the report’s recommendations </p>
<p>“including by providing specialist advice”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>A DFID&#8209;sponsored mission by the International Legal Assistance Consortium (ILAC) </p>
<p>visited Iraq from 13 to 30 August to scope projects for the reconstruction of the judicial </p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p> Four of the projects recommended by the mission formed the basis of the </p>
<p>£2.2m DFID&#8209;funded ILAC Justice Support Programme (see Box, ‘International Legal </p>
<p>Assistance Consortium’).</p>
<p>On 10 July, the AHMGIR considered a paper on judicial reform.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith said that corruption and intimidation had left the Iraqi judicial system in </p>
<p>a “worse state than expected” and that it would take a “long term commitment from the </p>
<p>international community and particularly the Arab world to rebuild”. He highlighted that Iraqi </p>
<p>people wanted a system that would deal with current crimes as well as legacy crimes.</p>
<p>Ministers agreed that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage qualified and vetted Iraqi legal experts to assist reconstruction of the </p>
<p>judicial sector;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage participation of the UN, Arab and international experts;</p>

<p><b>253. </b> The AHMGIR next discussed SSR on 17 July for which the IPU – which had been </p>
<p>renamed the ‘Iraq Policy Unit’ – provided an update paper.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> The paper stated that </p>
<p>there had been considerable progress in various SSR areas but that there was still no </p>
<p>cohesive strategy. That lack of strategy was described as “not necessarily … a cause for </p>
<p>current alarm” as it was a reflection of the rapidly moving situation in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> The paper described the splitting of SSR responsibilities as a “set back” and </p>
<p>informed Ministers that there were now four senior UK personnel in Baghdad working in </p>
<p>each of the main SSR areas (policing, intelligence, army and the MOD). Agreement that </p>
<p>DCC Brand would serve as Mr Kerik’s chief adviser was “an important gain”.</p>
<p><b>255. </b> The paper mentioned the requirement for approximately 7,000 international police </p>
<p>officers. The US intended to provide 700 and the UK 100. </p>
<p><b>256. </b> At the meeting of the AHMGIR, the IPU described the 7,000 target as “ambitious” </p>
<p>although they considered that the Organisation for Security and Co&#8209;operation in Europe </p>

<p>209</p>
<p> By that stage, a police donors’ conference should </p>
<p>have been held and international contributions established according to the original FCO </p>

<p>at the meeting or in the update paper.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> On 1 August, the UND wrote to DCC Brand asking him to push for a policing </p>

<p>“The UK and other states will be reluctant to engage in the reform of the Iraqi police </p>
<p>service unless we are shown that there is a clear strategy … If the CPA Interior </p>
<p>Ministry is genuinely considering the deployment of a significant mentoring mission, </p>
<p>it will urgently need to address these issues and make its case to a wider audience. </p>

<p><b>260. </b> On 8 July, Secretary Rumsfeld issued instructions to work up a plan and develop a </p>

<p>help.”</p>
<p><b>261. </b> That may be a reference to a video conference held on 3 July in which both </p>

<p>that the UK would “do our level best to meet any demand for additional resources”.</p>
<p>214</p>

<p>215</p>
<p> He estimated that Iraq needed 65,000&#8209;75,000 police officers and said that it </p>
<p>would take approximately six years to develop that size of force. Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>responded that it needed to be done in two years and allocated a US$120m budget from </p>
<p>Iraqi Government funds.</p>

<p>115</p>
<p>The next proposal, in September, was for a training college in Jordan</p>
<p> </p>
<p>which the CPA </p>
<p>considered could be made ready by November 2003.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> That facility would provide training </p>
<p>for 35,000 Iraqi police recruits in a series of eight&#8209;week training courses, each taking </p>
<p>1,500 students. </p>
<p>Training of new recruits began in Jordan on 29 November with 36 UK police officers </p>
<p>(a third of the training staff).</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> A further 40 UK officers were “on standby to join the … </p>
<p>project as it expands”. It was highlighted that: “Construction is behind schedule and </p>
<p>conditions poor.” </p>
<p>The first recruits to pass through the Jordan facility were existing recruits who had been </p>
<p>going through police training at the point of the invasion.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> Former DCC Brand described </p>
<p>the course as “very, very basic”.</p>
<p>Plans also progressed for police training inside Iraq. As mentioned in the CPA’s May </p>
<p>assessment of policing in Iraq, there were plans to open academies in Basra, Baghdad </p>
<p>and the North of the country. </p>
<p>Plans for an academy near Basra were initiated by the military and then taken on by DCC </p>
<p>Stephen White, Senior Police Adviser and Director of Law and Order for CPA(South). </p>
<p>The academy was to be known as the Regional Police Training Academy (RPTA) and </p>
<p>located at az&#8209;Zubayr, near Basra. </p>
<p>The Baghdad facility was run by a UK Chief Inspector and staffed by US military police.</p>

<p><b>New Iraqi security structures</b></p>
<p><b>265. </b> On 23 June, Mr Slocombe announced the formation of the New Iraqi Army (NIA).</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The plans for the NIA included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To have a full division equivalent of 12,000 soldiers, who would be trained and </p>
<p>operational in one year. By two years to have three divisions of 40,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To deploy battalions as they are trained, under the command of Iraqi officers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The military missions of the units will include protecting the nation’s borders, </p>
<p>provide military level security for certain routes and installations, help clear </p>
<p>mines and UXO [unexploded ordnance].”</p>
<p><b>266. </b> On 18 August, Ambassador Bremer signed CPA Order No.22, which set out the </p>
<p>mission and role of the NIA.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> It was to be responsible for:</p>
<p>“… the military defense of the nation, including defense of the national territory and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Although the NIA would have a role in internal disaster relief operations, the Order </p>
<p>was explicit that:</p>
<p>“The New Iraqi Army shall not have or exercise, domestic law enforcement functions, </p>
<p>nor intervene in the domestic political affairs of the nation.”</p>
<p><b>268. </b> Ambassador Bremer was established as Commander in Chief, pending transfer of </p>
<p>the role to an “internationally recognised, representative government, established by the </p>

<p><b>269. </b> Suitability for employment in the NIA would be judged on a number of criteria, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the absence of evidence of human rights violations or war crimes”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the absence of affiliation with the security and political control organs of the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“the absence of association with Extremist Organisations or other groups that </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>The GC is sometimes referred to as the Iraq Governing Council (IGC). The two titles refer </p>
<p>to the same body. The Inquiry has chosen to refer to the GC, for consistency, except </p>
<p>where quoting others who have used IGC. </p>
<p><b>273. </b> In July 2003, a new temporary Iraqi security force was established by US military </p>
<p>commanders in order to help fight the growing insurgency – the Iraqi Civil Defence </p>
<p>Corps (ICDC).</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> The concept was to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>give Coalition operations an Iraqi face;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>keep unemployed young men out of the insurgency; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase the number of security forces available.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>274. </b> ICDC personnel were locally recruited and expected to live at home. </p>
<p><b>275. </b> By August 2003, there were 23,000 ICDC personnel serving as linguists, security </p>
<p>personnel, drivers and humanitarian relief providers. They also participated in patrols, </p>
<p>convoys, cordons and checkpoints.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>276. </b> The ICDC was formally established by CPA Order No.28, signed by Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer on 3 September 2003.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> The Order explained that the ICDC was intended to be:</p>
<p>“… a security and emergency service agency for Iraq … composed of Iraqis who </p>
<p>will complement operations conducted by Coalition military forces in Iraq to counter </p>
<p>organized groups and individuals employing violence against the people of Iraq and </p>
<p>their national infrastructure.”</p>
<p><b>277. </b> The Order authorised the ICDC to perform “constabulary duties” including: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>patrolling urban and rural areas; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>conducting operations to search for and seize illegal weapons and other </p>

<p><b>278. </b> The ICDC operated under the authority of the Administrator of the CPA but was </p>
<p>subject to the supervision of Coalition Forces. <i>Hard Lessons</i> stated: </p>
<p>“… Because the ICDC was not part of the original CPA security sector plan, it posed </p>
<p>significant co&#8209;ordination problems from its inception …There was little coordination </p>
<p>with the Iraqi police or army and no accountability to any Iraqi ministry or the CPA.</p>
<p>“Some in CMATT feared the ICDC could become a parallel security structure, </p>
<p>competing with the police in local affairs and diluting the Iraqi Army’s authority at </p>
<p>the national level. But Coalition commanders valued the ICDC as a way to enable </p>
<p>Iraqis to provide security for their own country, while supplementing CJTF&#8209;7’s </p>
<p>[Combined Joint Task Force 7] overstretched forces.” </p>

<p>told the Inquiry that he believed the ICDC “was a success”.</p>

<p>238</p>
<p>DCC Brand told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… an opportunity arose for us to influence the direction in which the development </p>

<p>main area of expertise and doesn’t cause the problems of the intelligence people </p>
<p>having the power to arrest and detain and do whatever else they need to do to get </p>

<p>a decision. I could not get a special branch manager or somebody retired who had </p>
<p>that skill of being able to take the concept into reality, and so we lost the opportunity </p>
<p>and that disappeared.”</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>In April 2004, the Iraqi National Intelligence Service (INIS) was established. Its operational </p>
<p>officers and support staff had been trained and vetted and were based in Baghdad, with a </p>
<p>planned outstation in Basra.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> It included some former intelligence officers. </p>
<p>INIS was initially headed by former Major General Mohammed al&#8209;Shehwani, who had </p>
<p>been forced into exile by Saddam Hussein in 1984.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>In a paper by the MOD dated 6 June 2006, intelligence was one of the areas described as </p>
<p>“immature”, having been “placed deliberately at the back of the force generation process”.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>Later, in spring 2008, a new intelligence structure was developed in Basra.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> Lieutenent </p>
<p>General Barney White&#8209;Spunner, GOC MND(SE) from February to August 2008, described </p>
<p>that structure to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… at the end of the Charge of the Knights, General Mohammed and I put together, </p>
<p>I hope, quite a sophisticated counter&#8209;terrorist structure in Basra with a co&#8209;ordination </p>
<p>committee which brought all the Iraqi Security Forces together. We fused them into </p>
<p>various intelligence agencies … We were able to combine police and army posts </p>
<p>across the city.”</p>

<p><b>Global Conflict Prevention Pool Strategy</b></p>
<p><b>281. </b> On 1 August, Ministers from the FCO, DFID and the MOD were asked to agree a </p>
<p>joint FCO/DFID/MOD Iraq Strategy for the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP).</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Strategy aimed to provide a coherent framework for UK activities aimed at </p>
<p>preventing conflict in Iraq. It defined its “initial focus of activity” as SSR. Work on that </p>
<p>element of the Strategy was the most well developed, and Ministers were invited to </p>
<p>agree that expenditure on SSR activities could start immediately while work continued </p>
<p>to define the other elements of the Strategy. </p>
<p><b>Global Conflict Prevention Pool </b></p>
<p>The Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) was a UK Government fund bringing together </p>
<p>the work of the FCO, the MOD and DFID in conflict prevention.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> The aim was a more </p>
<p>strategic and cost&#8209;effective approach to conflict prevention and reduction. Activities </p>
<p>included conflict assessments, supporting peace initiatives and DDR programmes.</p>
<p><b>282. </b> The “second element” of the Strategy was assistance to “Iraqi governorates and </p>
<p>local administrations within the British AO as they develop to ensure that policy decisions </p>
<p>are made strategically and with an understanding of conflict prevention issues.”</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>included assistance to improve access to justice, encourage the involvement of women </p>
<p>in local administrations, and develop a fair and equitable prison service. The third </p>
<p>element was further studies and analyses to assist in the development of UK conflict </p>
<p>prevention strategies. The geographical spread of the programmes had not yet been </p>
<p>determined, although there were “good arguments” in favour of focusing in the South </p>
<p>to deliver an “exemplar southern model”.</p>
<p><b>283. </b> The estimated cost of the Strategy was £7.5m per year for the UK financial years </p>
<p>2003/04 and 2004/05. Of the £15m total, £9.5m was allocated for SSR, £4m for local </p>
<p>governance and £1.5m for further studies and analyses. The implementation plan for </p>
<p>the Strategy listed a number of SSR activities, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support for the police; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support for customs reform including the deployment of nine HM Customs and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the decision by the UN to withdraw from Iraq which they took around about the </p>
<p>middle of September after a security review, I think … was regrettable, and it meant </p>
<p>for several months they were not really playing any sort of role in Iraq. It also meant </p>
<p>when Lakhdar Brahimi [the UN’s Special Envoy to Iraq] arrived, initially in the end of </p>
<p>January 2004 and then again in April 2004, he was really working on his own.”</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>Policing strategy: Iraqiisation</b></p>
<p><b>286. </b> By early September 2003, the concept of “Iraqiisation” had started being used in </p>
<p>Whitehall (see Section 9.2). The term “Iraqiisation” did not have a common or precise </p>
<p>definition, but was generally used to mean the ability of the ISF to maintain security </p>
<p>independently, rather than under the leadership of the international forces. </p>
<p><b>287. </b> On 2 September, Mr Blair held a meeting of Ministers and senior personnel.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They included Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, Mr Hilary Benn (the International Development </p>
<p>Secretary), Gen Walker, Sir Richard Dearlove (Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service), </p>
<p>Mr John Scarlett (Chairman, Joint Intelligence Committee), Sir Jeremy Greenstock (the </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq from September), Mr Sawers (from </p>
<p>August the FCO Director General for Political Affairs) and No.10 officials.</p>
<p><b>288. </b> The account of the meeting stated that “the Prime Minister wanted action on </p>
<p>Iraq taken forward with a heightened sense of urgency” ahead of a planned telephone </p>
<p>conversation with President Bush to review progress. In relation to internal security, the </p>
<p>record stated:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister believes that the key to the security situation in Iraq is the rapid </p>
<p>mobilisation of an effective Iraqi police force. This should include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Police manpower up to 70,000 within three months, as a stage towards a full </p>
<p>force;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adequate trainers and secure training facilities;</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>290. </b> The paper reiterated that the existing strategy was to have 70,000 Iraqi police in </p>
<p>place by mid&#8209;2004 and a 40,000&#8209;strong Iraqi Army in place within a year. It stated that </p>
<p>the UK’s target was to have deployed 100 police trainers by the end of 2003, out of a </p>
<p>planned CPA total of 600. </p>
<p><b>291. </b> The paper reiterated that the “training of the police should be accelerated and </p>
<p>given a proper strategy (without which potential international contributors will not come </p>
<p>forward)” but did not give details of how this might happen. The IPU considered that the </p>
<p>key principles for what could be achieved were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Coalition should work through existing local leadership and customs and </p>
<p>Iraqis must take increasing security responsibility.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence on the threats should be improved.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>De&#8209;Ba’athification principles should be applied flexibly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Key programmes should be accelerated and made more effective, including </p>
<p>by bringing police and army reform under a single head and providing more </p>
<p>resources.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition Forces should be released for counter&#8209;terrorism tasks by giving basic </p>
<p>security tasks to Iraqi forces. </p>
<p><b>292. </b> In conclusion, the paper stated: </p>
<p>“While we develop Iraqi capability and broaden the international security presence, </p>
<p>we must keep threats under control. This means more Coalition Forces are needed </p>
<p>in the short term …” </p>
<p><b>293. </b> There was no proposal for where this resource should come from, nor was </p>
<p>there an assessment of whether it was realistic to train 70,000 police officers within a </p>
<p>three&#8209;month period as suggested by Mr Blair. </p>
<p><b>294. </b> Another briefing paper, produced by Mr David Richmond,</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> stated that although </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer agreed with the importance of accelerating recruitment he did not: </p>
<p>“… think that a target of 70,000 within the next three months is achievable. The </p>
<p>cost would be huge and, however successful we were in speeding up training, the </p>
<p>overwhelming majority of new recruits would end up with no training at all. This </p>
<p>would be counter&#8209;productive.”</p>

<p><b>295. </b> The IPU paper was considered by the AHMGIR on 4 September.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> The minutes </p>
<p>recorded that the IPU stated: </p>
<p>“The US had elaborate plans for Security Sector Reform, but faster action was </p>
<p>needed. We should give priority to the rapid expansion of the Civil Defence </p>
<p>Corps and the Facilities Protection Service … We should consider encouraging </p>
<p>neighbourhood security schemes and working with tribal leaders in rural areas.” </p>
<p><b>296. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock was recorded as warning that the proposals “were not </p>
<p>enough to bring the impact required in the short term”.</p>
<p><b>297. </b> Ministers agreed that ideas in the paper were “useful but required further work </p>
<p>which should be taken forward urgently”.</p>
<p><b>298. </b> Ahead of a video conference with President Bush on 5 September (see </p>
<p>Section 6.2), Mr Blair sent the President a Note which stated: </p>
<p>“Iraq has 37,000 police. We need to double that. Given the number of trainers and </p>
<p>their facilities, that will take a year. We cannot wait that long. So: if we need to treble </p>
<p>or quadruple the trainers and expand the numbers of Iraqi police even beyond </p>
<p>that contemplated, we should do it. Some of the Governing Council believe that in </p>
<p>certain areas, they should decide how far to take de&#8209;Ba’athification in order to speed </p>
<p>up the process. There may be good constraints/reasons why these things should </p>
<p>not happen or take time, but we have to be very clear that the priority is to get </p>
<p>movement fast. There must also be a top quality intelligence capability given to the </p>
<p>Iraqis to act on the threat. This is essential.”</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>299. </b> The record of the video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush stated </p>
<p>that Mr Blair said a “big push” was required in boosting numbers and speeding up </p>
<p>training of Iraqi Security Forces.</p>

<p>which is addressed in Section 9.2).</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> The IPU maintained that the focus should be on </p>
<p>the ICDC and the police “as the most likely to produce quick results, while continuing </p>
<p>to support the longer&#8209;term development of the New Iraqi Army”. It did not address </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s concept of trebling the trainers available or expanding Iraqi police numbers. </p>
<p><b>301. </b> For ICDC development, the IPU said that more UK Short Term Training Teams </p>
<p>were required and that national funding should be used to avoid “procedural delays”. </p>

<p>The MOD was also pursuing deployment of 12 non&#8209;commissioned officers to assist with </p>
<p>training of the Iraqi Army. </p>
<p><b>302. </b> The IPU assessed that “the main problem in developing the Iraqi Police is the </p>
<p>slowness with which CPA is developing its strategy, concept and timelines for reform” </p>
<p>and that “in the absence of a central strategy, we are pursuing regional options”. </p>
<p><b>303. </b> In the meeting, most of the actions in the paper were agreed although the </p>
<p>minutes make no mention of the use of national resources to progress SSR.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> It was </p>
<p>also suggested that DCC Brand could potentially produce a policing strategy and that </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock should lobby Ambassador Bremer on the “necessity of having </p>
<p>a strategy”. </p>
<p><b>304. </b> On 14 September, Sir Jeremy Greenstock sent a teleletter to Sir Nigel </p>

<p>Private Secretary) and Sir Hilary Synnott (Head of CPA(South)).</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“Security will colour everything. The right way forward is Iraqiisation, particularly </p>
<p>in the police. Bremer and his advisers are clear on the principle. But there is as </p>
<p>yet no central plan for police training, and no CPA focal point for driving it forward. </p>
<p>I am going to have to expend ammunition on this soon. Meanwhile London (and </p>
<p>Washington) should be maximising the input of resources into the police area, not </p>
<p>just training but also the provision of cars, equipment, radios etc. All this should </p>
<p>be prepared now, even if Ministers only sign it off when they see the planned </p>
<p>requirement set out. It is truly urgent.”</p>
<p><b>305. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting of the AHMGIR on 18 September </p>
<p>re&#8209;affirmed the requirement for a “coherent overall policing strategy”.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> Cabinet Office </p>
<p>officials reported that the UK was lobbying Ambassador Bremer and Washington to </p>
<p>expedite creation of a strategy and operational plan, and was offering the services of </p>
<p>DCC Brand to write them. The paper did not reflect Mr Blair’s desire to treble the number </p>
<p>of police trainers. </p>

<p>126</p>
<p><b>A co&#8209;ordinated UK Government policy on SSR – but no </b></p>
<p><b>mention of Iraq</b></p>
<p>In September 2003, a Whitehall policy seminar was held to look at best practice on </p>
<p>SSR.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> To coincide with that, officials within the FCO, the MOD and DFID had planned to </p>
<p>publish a report on SSR best practice. The MOD minute to Ministers stated that “SSR is </p>
<p>an area that necessitates high levels of co&#8209;operation and co&#8209;ordination between all three </p>
<p>Departments” and that the Departments had, in the Global Conflict Prevention Pool SSR </p>
<p>Strategy, a “common objective of helping governments of developing and transitional </p>
<p>countries fulfil their legitimate security functions through reforms that will make the delivery </p>
<p>of security more democratically accountable, as well as more effective and efficient”. </p>
<p>However, there was “currently no joint policy brief to guide practitioners” beyond a 1999 </p>
<p>DFID statement on the link between poverty and security, which had become out of date.</p>
<p>There was no mention of Iraq in the SSR report or the Ministerial foreword.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>307. </b> On 19 September, DCC Brand produced an “Info Memo” for Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>containing a plan for Iraqi police training and development.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> DCC Brand wrote that the </p>
<p>goal was to establish a 65,000&#8209;70,000 member Iraqi police force over 18 months to two </p>
<p>years with an estimated annual cost of US$970m. That would require 600 international </p>
<p>trainers and 1,500 international police advisers and mentors with executive authority. </p>
<p><b>308. </b> DCC Brand broke the plan down into four strands:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Police recruitment and selection (US$5m) – to identify and initially screen at </p>
<p>least 33,000 qualified candidates with a team of 25 police and 150 MOI staff.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Police training (US$150m) – to be run in Iraq and Jordan. Existing police officers </p>
<p>would receive a three&#8209;week Transitional Integration Programme and new recruits </p>
<p>would receive an eight&#8209;week basic police skills recruit course.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Police institutional reform and development (US$800m) – to create a </p>
<p>“uniformed 1,500 member International Coalition Police Force (ICPF) which </p>
<p>will have executive authority and authorised to be armed, and will implement </p>
<p>new organisational structures, standard operating procedures, training and </p>
<p>equipment guidelines for police throughout Iraq under command of a CPA </p>
<p>appointed commissioner”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Developing police operational capacities (US$20m) – to focus on developing </p>
<p>specialised skills to deal with organised kidnapping, extortion and trafficking.</p>

<p><b>309. </b> The only comment on the plan seen by the Inquiry came from CC Kernaghan who </p>
<p>expressed concerns about the ICPF, writing:</p>
<p>“To avoid problems later on, this concept requires thought and staff work now.” </p>
<p>272</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>310. </b> The Inquiry has not been able to establish what became of that plan: it has not </p>
<p>seen any further reference to it in contemporary papers.</p>
<p><b>311. </b> At a video conference with President Bush on 13 October, Mr Blair stressed the </p>
<p>importance he attached to Iraqiisation of the police and ICDC.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>312. </b> By mid&#8209;October no agreed CPA policing strategy had been produced. Despite that, </p>
<p>on 17 October an update from Mr Straw’s office to No.10 stated: “We judge that the </p>
<p>Coalition now has a credible and deliverable strategy to train 30,000 Iraqi police over the </p>
<p>next year.” </p>

<p><b>International contribution to police trainers</b></p>
<p>Following US/CPA/UK discussions in Amman and London on international police trainers, </p>

<p>3 October.</p>
<p>276</p>

<p>The Police Contributors Conference, originally planned for 30 June, was held on </p>
<p>20 October in London and hosted by the FCO.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> It was attended by representatives from </p>
<p>EU Member and Accession States, the European Council, Canada, Australia, Jordan and </p>
<p>Singapore. The focus of the event appears to have been to encourage countries to deploy </p>
<p>police trainers to staff the training facility in Jordan (see Box, Police training academies’), </p>
<p>rather than into Iraq. “Firm” pledges of support in the form of trainers for the Jordan </p>
<p>facility were received from Canada (20), Poland (10) and the Czech Republic (10), with </p>
<p>other countries reported to be likely to decide on contributions after the Madrid Donors’ </p>

<p>The target for 70,000 police should be reached by August 2004 rather than </p>
<p>March 2005. As a result training of the Iraqi Army will be slowed, but the Army </p>

<p>I had to say ‘Okay, in that case then, why don’t you give me the military to train? </p>
<p>I have read a few war books, I have seen a few war films, it can’t be as difficult as </p>
<p>that, or is that as ridiculous as what you are suggesting, which is we recruit 30,000 in </p>
<p>30 days, call them police, label them police, give them weapons and say ‘You are </p>
<p>now in the police’ but actually have no capability to do the things that policemen </p>
<p>should do at all?”</p>

<p><b>319. </b> CC Kernaghan visited Iraq for the second time in mid&#8209;November 2003.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> His visit </p>
<p>was affected by a “security ‘lockdown’” which meant he was unable to travel into Basra </p>
<p>and so met Sir Hilary Synnott in Basra Airport.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>320. </b> In his report to the Home and Foreign Secretaries, CC Kernaghan commented: </p>
<p>“… the ‘bad luck’ factor has kicked in with a vengeance … The security situation is </p>
<p>not good and will become worse, but the answer to many aspects of the problem </p>
<p>is an effective Iraqi security infrastructure … It is quite clear that the current level of </p>
<p>UK police assistance is unsustainable in that it is insufficient to deliver a coherent </p>
<p>package of support and I suggest that the UK Government has to decide to either </p>
<p>increase our assistance or withdraw our support altogether.”</p>
<p>286</p>
<p><b>321. </b> CC Kernaghan stated that he “detected the lack of a clear vision” for policing </p>
<p>within Iraq and was concerned that a “hybrid US City department/UK police service” </p>
<p>was being created. He commented that he was “unclear as to the overall CPA Iraq </p>
<p>‘model’ and whether or not a single tier national service is being created”. CC Kernaghan </p>
<p>also reported that senior officials were “reluctant to be definitive as to the CP[A]’s </p>
<p>strategic plan” because “meetings in Washington (and London) might well totally change </p>
<p>existing plans”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>322. </b> A Cabinet Office Ministerial update on 19 November stated: </p>
<p>“The CPA has no current plans to draw up a formal policing strategy. Their view is </p>
<p>that command, control and administrative arrangements for the police will depend </p>
<p>heavily on unsettled constitutional issues and thus must await further political </p>
<p>progress … Partly in this context, Jim Daniel, a senior ex&#8209;HO [Home Office] adviser, </p>
<p>sent<b> </b>by us to help generate a policing strategy has decided to resign.” </p>
<p>287</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>323. </b> The update did not state the UK’s view of the CPA position but said: </p>
<p>“In response, we are following up a new request from DCC Brand … for additional </p>
<p>UK officers to support him in implementing the existing training plan.”</p>
<p><b>324. </b> As early as May 2003, Sir David Manning and Ambassador Bremer recognised that:</p>
<p>“De&#8209;Ba’athification and the dissolution of security ministries would create a new </p>
<p>reservoir of angry men. So there was a need to step up patrols and tighten up </p>
<p>security.” </p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>325. </b> At the end of 2003, as security worsened, the debate around the extent to which </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification should be applied to the Iraqi Security Forces was ongoing. </p>
<p><b>326. </b> Between October and December, the issue of re&#8209;employing Ba’athist security </p>
<p>personnel was mentioned three times in communications between Mr Blair and </p>
<p>President Bush. </p>
<p><b>327. </b> On 7 October, in a video conference with President Bush Mr Blair “urged </p>
<p>sensitive handling of demobilised ex&#8209;Iraqi Army soldiers”.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>328. </b> In a video conference on 27 October, Mr Blair highlighted the possibility of </p>
<p>re&#8209;mobilising “former Ba’athist intelligence officers”.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>329. </b> Before President Bush’s visit to the UK in November 2003, Mr Rycroft gave </p>
<p>Mr Blair a copy of a paper entitled ‘Iraq: Security’, for discussion with President Bush.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The document was described as “Jeremy’s paper” and the Inquiry assumes that it was </p>
<p>written by Sir Jeremy Greenstock. Under the heading “Iraqiisation” it said:</p>
<p>“<i>Must accept previously Ba’athist elements in the security forces</i>, provided not linked </p>
<p>with former repression. Militias … need to be brought in in an inclusive transparent </p>
<p>way … plans for this should be drawn up immediately with IGC.”</p>

<p><b>330. </b> Mr Blair gave President Bush a slightly revised version of Sir Jeremy’s paper, in </p>
<p>which this text had not been altered.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>331. </b> Mr Richmond visited Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, in mid&#8209;November.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dominant theme of his discussions was local concerns about unemployment as a </p>
<p>result of the dismantling of Iraqi military structures. </p>
<p><b>332. </b> Mr Richmond reported:</p>
<p>“Unemployment had forced many to do illegal acts, including attacks on the </p>
<p>Coalition. They wanted to help the Coalition and could do much to improve the </p>
<p>security situation if they could be given back their jobs; they were also keen to serve </p>
<p>their country. They complained about de&#8209;Ba’athification which made it impossible </p>
<p>for most of them to be employed by the State. The governor said that 50 percent </p>
<p>had joined the Ba’ath Party not out of conviction but because it was a condition of </p>
<p>employment; 40 percent for material gain; and only some 10 percent because they </p>
<p>supported Ba’athist ideology … </p>
<p>“Jerry Thompson (CPA advisor for security affairs) explained the acceleration of </p>
<p>recruitment to the ICDC, police and the New Iraqi Army [NIA], but he pointed out </p>
<p>the different nature of the NIA and the fact that it would be much smaller than the </p>
<p>old army. Recruiting in Ramadi would start in January. He encouraged them to </p>
<p>participate.”</p>
<p><b>333. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 4 December, Mr Blair was recorded </p>
<p>to have underlined the importance of Iraqiisation, including involving the Sunni </p>
<p>community and ex&#8209;Ba’athists.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>334. </b> In mid&#8209;November a new political timetable for Iraq was announced, which brought </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>336. </b> Also in November, Secretary Rumsfeld ordered Major General Karl Eikenberry, </p>
<p>former US Security Co&#8209;ordinator and Chief of the Office of Military Co&#8209;operation in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, to assess what reforms were necessary to produce enough capable Iraqi </p>
<p>forces to take over security responsibilities.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> His report, published in February 2004, </p>
<p>is described later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> In December 2003, the CPA produced a plan to achieve the accelerated timetable </p>
<p>for transfer of authority by the end of June 2004.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>338. </b> The plan included a section on security which stated that to meet the accelerated </p>
<p>timeline, the following changes were required:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an accelerated stand&#8209;up of the IMOD and the National Command Authority;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accelerated development of internal security capabilities in the MOI  </p>
<p>(Anti&#8209;Terrorist Branch, criminal intelligence);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a focus on anti&#8209;corruption capacity&#8209;building; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accelerated recruitment, training and deployment of Iraqi Security Forces.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> The plan also described two key security policy decisions that were required, </p>
<p>as identified by CPA staff:</p>
<p>“First, the development of a holistic approach to the Iraqi security sector, including </p>
<p>clarification of ICDC missions and interface with other security elements. Second, </p>
<p>decisions on the integration of former militias into security forces and on militia </p>
<p>demobilization.”</p>
<p><b>340. </b> On 4 December, the CPA Office of Policy Planning and Analysis produced a paper </p>
<p>entitled ‘Iraq: Integrated Security Sector Development’.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> It was an assessment of the </p>
<p>current situation and plans, the desired position and a consideration of what thinking and </p>
<p>action was required by the CPA and CJTF&#8209;7 to achieve the desired position. </p>
<p><b>341. </b> It is the first assessment the Inquiry has seen that attempted to articulate all SSR </p>
<p>plans in one paper and consider how they interacted. The executive summary explained </p>
<p>that the paper benefited from detailed input by security sector experts in both CPA and </p>
<p>CJTF&#8209;7. </p>
<p><b>342. </b> The paper described the CPA&#8209;defined end state for security in Iraq as:</p>
<p>“</p>

<p>to participate fully in political and economic life;</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government has the means, including its own defense and police </p>
<p>forces, to assume its responsibility for external and internal security, including </p>
<p>policing of its borders; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the roles and accountabilities of organizations providing security are clearly </p>
<p>defined within a legal framework which governs, <i>inter alia,</i> the ownership of </p>
<p>weapons.”</p>
<p><b>343. </b> The paper stated that CPA and CJTF&#8209;7 activity had “often been driven by </p>
<p>the short&#8209;term requirement to address pressing security needs” and highlighted </p>
<p>weaknesses:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We have not designed our security sector development program based on a </p>
<p>thorough conflict assessment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is no overarching security vision for Iraq that joins up short&#8209;term current </p>
<p>activities with long&#8209;term goals;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We are focusing on building tactical and operational capabilities – the building </p>
<p>of Iraqi governance and oversight capacity is proceeding more slowly;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Local ownership of the Security Sector Reform process and policy is in its </p>
<p>infancy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We are focusing on ‘hard’ security force development with limited attention being </p>
<p>paid to building ‘soft’ Iraqi capacity to prevent or manage conflicts.”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> The paper assessed each element of the security sector before discussing its </p>
<p>overall governance and accountability. Although the long&#8209;term aim for the NIA was a </p>
<p>focus on external security, it was likely that it would be employed on internal security and </p>
<p>so a legal framework for that was needed. The ICDC would become an army reserve. </p>
<p>The paper also mentioned plans to develop an Iraqi Coastal Defence capability and an </p>
<p>aviation element for transportation and medical evacuation by autumn 2004. All that </p>
<p>would be organised by a Joint Forces Headquarters which would be established by </p>
<p>June 2004. </p>
<p><b>345. </b> The desired end state for the IPS was a “single nation&#8209;wide police service that </p>
<p>combines centralized standards and policies with local accountability … Its 85,000 </p>
<p>officers will be well&#8209;trained through a combination of basic mandate training, mentoring, </p>
<p>and specialist and leadership training”. The paper highlighted that the IPS was being </p>
<p>developed whilst it was in the front line fighting the insurgency campaign. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Problems with individual ministerial capacity to manage the FPS were also </p>
<p>identified.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>347. </b> The paper described some activity on intelligence services, including the IPS </p>
<p>developing basic criminal intelligence capabilities in Baghdad and MOI plans for a </p>
<p>national criminal intelligence unit. There was an absence of a suitable legal framework. </p>
<p>The paper stated that oversight mechanisms which balanced effectiveness with </p>
<p>accountability were required.</p>
<p><b>348. </b> On criminal justice, the paper stated that courts were “back up and running </p>
<p>nationwide, albeit at below their pre&#8209;war capacity” and that prisons were being repaired </p>
<p>or reconstructed. There were also fundamental revisions to the penal code and </p>
<p>procedures. It described justice and policing systems as mutually reinforcing. It identified </p>
<p>a number of issues, including the vulnerability of the judiciary to violence and prison </p>
<p>capacity, which it recommended should be addressed. </p>
<p><b>349. </b> The paper also contained a section on militias, where it assessed that there were </p>
<p>over 30 known militias with between 30,000 and 60,000 personnel. It explained that </p>
<p>the Coalition’s original intent for militia personnel had been DDR. However, that had </p>
<p>not happened due to the violence it might provoke, the absence of police to “fill the </p>
<p>vacuums” and the complexity of the task. The paper stated:</p>
<p>“Since the November 15 Agreement, there has been a tendency amongst the </p>
<p>political parties to hold on to their militias to protect their interests … The creation of </p>
<p>an ICDC ‘special battalion’ and CT [counter&#8209;terrorism] company from G&#8209;5 militias is </p>
<p>a departure from the CPA policy of seeking to disband militias but may provide an </p>
<p>alternative means of integrating the party militias.” </p>
<p><b>350. </b> The paper recommended that policy on militias should be clarified.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>351. </b> The governance and accountability section of the paper emphasised the </p>
<p>importance of civilian control, noting that the “institutionalisation of CPA/Iraqi civil </p>
<p>governance mechanisms is falling behind the development of fielded forces”. On police </p>
<p>accountability the paper stated: </p>
<p>“The outstanding issue is the question of the structure of the national police service </p>
<p>and the relationships of local police services with Governors and Provincial Councils. </p>
<p>The model currently being proposed involves a higher degree of central control than </p>
<p>initially envisaged; this has been deemed necessary in the emergency period.” </p>
<p><b>352. </b> The paper described a series of high&#8209;level actions required to develop governance </p>
<p>further including building oversight mechanisms into the Fundamental Law</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>creating security architecture to run a counter&#8209;insurgency campaign.</p>
<p>300 </p>
<p>The ‘Fundamental Law’ is the law that determines the constitution of government.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>353. </b> In summary, the paper stated that the CPA “still lacks an organisational mechanism </p>
<p>for delivering joined&#8209;up policy direction on the security sector”. It recommended that </p>
<p>detailed planning was required to transfer security to Iraqi control.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> It is unclear what became of the paper – there is no mention of it in contemporary </p>
<p>papers that the Inquiry has seen. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> Towards the end of 2003, there was awareness in the UK system that </p>
<p>assessments given by US commanders were “exaggerated” and there were doubts </p>
<p>about Iraqi capacity.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>356. </b> By the middle of December, the FCO assessed that there were around 45,000 </p>
<p>operational police throughout Iraq, all requiring some level of re&#8209;training.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> The US </p>
<p>assessment was that there were 63,000 operational police. </p>
<p><b>357. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 18 December meeting of the AHMGIR stated:</p>
<p>“US military plans for Iraqiisation of security remain highly ambitious. [General] </p>
<p>Abizaid foresees Coalition military withdrawal from cities and Iraqi police able to </p>
<p>combat terrorists by April 2004. But this handover can only take place if targets for </p>
<p>expanding Iraqi units are met.”</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>358. </b> The minutes of the meeting recorded that Ministers “noted the security situation </p>
<p>and that Iraqi security capacity was not being built up at a sufficient rate and quality </p>
<p>to meet CPA aspirations” and “agreed that they and officials should lobby their US </p>
<p>counterparts to improve training of Iraqi Security Forces, particularly the police”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>An internal DFID review of the project in June 2006 concluded that although the training </p>
<p>(held in Dubai for security reasons) was generally of a high quality and cost&#8209;effective, </p>
<p>the project was unlikely to lead to sustainable improvements in professional practice in </p>
<p>the absence of any continuing in&#8209;country support for the trainees or any links to broader </p>
<p>institutional reform processes.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> An in&#8209;country justice adviser had been recruited to </p>
<p>mitigate these weaknesses, but she had been withdrawn from Iraq after 10 days for </p>
<p>security reasons. The review commented:</p>
<p>“… the project should have been used as an entry point for DFID’s work in this sector, </p>
<p>been more flexible in the range of activities it could support, and been more closely </p>
<p>linked to efforts at donor co&#8209;ordination … The [review] team acknowledges that the </p>
<p>project was put together under pressure rapidly to get programme activities started </p>
<p>with some quick&#8209;win activities … The pressure to move fast, however, may well have </p>
<p>sown the seeds for the eventual, limited impact.”</p>
<p><b>359. </b> In late January 2004, Acting DCC Brand reported that it had been agreed at a </p>

<p>“Sufficient detailed progress has been made towards the achievement of an IMOD </p>
<p>with an initial operating capacity available from 1 May 04. Additional UK staffing </p>
<p>assistance is warranted in the context of both immediate needs and future mentoring </p>

<p>mentoring implementation project, to deliver the institutional development of a fully </p>
<p>functional MOD, would be appropriate.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> The DAT recommended that the UK provide immediate assistance in the areas of </p>
<p>vetting and public affairs, and consider a longer&#8209;term role mentoring key positions within </p>
<p>the IMOD. The total mentoring requirement was expected to be around 17 staff, of whom </p>
<p>five should be MOD UK&#8209;based civilians. The project was forecast to last two years at a </p>

<p>the need for sustained monitoring and mentoring of the ISF beyond 1 July 2004; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the endorsement of the CENTCOM Strategic Concept to transfer security </p>
<p>responsibilities to Iraqi forces that would permit a reduction in the numbers </p>
<p>of Coalition Forces needed to perform internal security tasks. The timelines </p>

<p>{</p>
<p>local transfer by 1 July 2004; </p>

<p>{</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>national transfer by September 2006.</p>
<p><b>370. </b> The report recommended that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The training and equipping programmes for the<b> </b>IPS<b> </b>should be accelerated </p>
<p>significantly, the numbers of police increased and the Coalition military given the </p>
<p>task of training, equipping, mentoring and certifying them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ICDC should be renamed the Iraqi Civil Guard, be recognised as an </p>
<p>enduring organisation (possibly a gendarmerie&#8209;type force) under the control of </p>
<p>the IMOD, have its strength increased from 36 to 43 battalions and be given </p>
<p>professional development.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Army’s focus should remain on external threats but its training rate </p>
<p>could be reduced (to allow more rapid development of other security forces).</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>371. </b> The summary of the report produced for the Chiefs of Staff stated: </p>
<p>“… the UK, through MND(SE), is regarded as the leader in ‘best practice’; in </p>

<p><b>373. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald chaired a meeting of the Iraq Strategy Group on </p>
<p>13 February.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p> A record of the meeting by Mr Tom Dodd, OD Sec, stated that “Baghdad </p>
<p>and Washington were still divided over the future of the ICDC”: General Abizaid </p>
<p>and Ambassador Bremer “preferred it becoming an army reserve” as opposed to </p>
<p>Maj Gen Eikenberry’s proposed gendarmerie. </p>
<p><b>374. </b> According to the RAND assessment of the Occupation of Iraq, Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer welcomed the proposal to put training of the Iraqi military under Coalition military </p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> However, he was resistant to the proposal that police training should transfer </p>
<p>to military responsibility, arguing strongly that policing was a civilian, not a military, </p>
<p>profession. </p>
<p><b>375. </b> The briefing for the AHMGIR on 1 March stated that the Eikenberry Review had </p>
<p>identified “significant shortcomings, particularly with the police”.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p> Delays with deploying </p>
<p>mentors (“1,500 international civilian police mentors have not deployed as planned”) </p>
<p>and problems with the Jordan training school (which was running at half capacity) </p>
<p>were assessed to be due to US funding issues. The UK contribution was described </p>
<p>as “disproportionate” and the brief recorded that:</p>
<p>“MND(SE)’s approach to SSR is considered a model. The British Army is active in </p>
<p>training ICDC battalions and the New Iraqi Army. We provide the largest contingent </p>
<p>of police trainers in Jordan (72); the UK&#8209;run az&#8209;Zubayr police academy is now </p>
<p>training 300 police every three weeks; and a group of PSNI [Police Service of </p>
<p>Northern Ireland] superintendents are about to deploy to the South to mentor </p>
<p>provincial police chiefs. We are also considering contracting around 40 police </p>
<p>advisers as monitors, expanding the training programme at az&#8209;Zubayr, and offering </p>
<p>police leadership training in the UK. The UK will also play a leading role in the </p>
<p>formation of the new Iraqi MOD.” </p>
<p><b>376. </b> At the meeting Ministers “noted the Coalition’s work in standing up Iraqi security </p>
<p>forces and the UK’s disproportionate contribution to it”.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld accepted Maj Gen Eikenberry’s recommendation that the US </p>
<p>military should manage the training of Iraq’s army and police.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>378. </b> On 8 March, DCC Brand’s weekly report described the creation of a new “umbrella </p>
<p>structure”, the Office of Security Co&#8209;operation (OSC), commanded by Major General </p>
<p>Paul Eaton, the former commander of CMATT.</p>
<p> 328</p>
<p> CMATT and the newly named policing </p>
<p>equivalent – the Coalition Police Assistance Training Team (CPATT) – would report </p>
<p>to the OSC. A diagram of “Command and Control Relationships” showed the OSC </p>
<p>reporting to CJTF&#8209;7. </p>
<p><b>379. </b> The creation of OSC resulted in a complex structure for police reform: CPATT </p>
<p>became responsible for recruiting, training, equipping and mentoring the police but the </p>
<p>CPA/MOI retained the operational and institution&#8209;building element of police reform. </p>
<p><b>380. </b> CMATT and CPATT were both led by UK officers: Brigadier Nigel Aylwin&#8209;Foster </p>
<p>and Brigadier Andrew MacKay respectively.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>381. </b> Former DCC Brand told the Inquiry that the creation of OSC was: </p>
<p>“… quite a shock to both myself and the American director [Mr Casteel] because, </p>
<p>overnight, the Secretary of Defense in the United States had basically taken away </p>
<p>all responsibility for policing, including the training, equipping and recruiting, and </p>
<p>given it to the military, and that included a budget that was US$950m. We had had </p>
<p>no indication of this and neither he nor I actually knew where it left us. So we went </p>
<p>to see Ambassador Bremer to say, ‘Can you give us some direction as to what our </p>
<p>responsibilities will be?’ and I don’t think he was too clear either on what the impact </p>
<p>of this was. The military were very clear that it was just theirs and this would tidy </p>
<p>things up … it was rather draconian in terms of its mood, and the consequences … </p>
<p>one was that, whilst they could do the volume stuff, they still didn’t have the skill </p>
<p>sets for basic training, and then the one thing they didn’t have, which was just so </p>
<p>essential, and which the military training side had, is that policy advice back in </p>
<p>Washington on policing. They had none. So they were making it up, in that sense, </p>
<p>from theatre, rather than back at the policy headquarters.”</p>
<p> 330</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> On 2 April, the Cabinet Office sent an update for Ministers, in between two </p>
<p>meetings of the AHMGIR, stating that police training was to be accelerated under the </p>
<p>new structures with a target of completing in&#8209;service training of 43,000 officers by </p>
<p>January 2005.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> There were plans to expand the capacity of the Baghdad and Mosul </p>
<p>training academies. The update also highlighted a “critical shortfall” in equipment for the </p>
<p>police, the border police and the army. That was put down to issues with US contracting </p>
<p>and funding. </p>

<p>141</p>
<p><b>Security worsens and Iraqi Security Force weaknesses are exposed</b></p>
<p><b>383. </b> On 25 March, the FCO’s Weekly Update on Iraq for No.10 stated that a CENTCOM </p>
<p>review had concluded that transition to local control across Iraq was “likely to be delayed </p>
<p>by up to eight months from their original over optimistic target of May 2004”.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p> That was </p>
<p>due to delays in MOI programmes. The paper stated that that was “not a surprise”:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Security Forces do not just have to be hired; they must be vetted, trained, </p>
<p>equipped, mentored and certified ie capability, not numbers, is the key … Bremer </p>
<p>has been pushing for quality for months, without the support in Washington, where </p>
<p>the emphasis has been on numbers. On the positive side, a lesson has now been </p>
<p>learned.”</p>
<p><b>384. </b> In March, Lt Gen Sanchez announced that once the ISF proved capable and </p>
<p>credible enough to maintain local security, Coalition Forces would redeploy to bases </p>
<p>outside major cities.</p>
<p>333</p>
<p> From</p>
<p> </p>
<p>there they would co&#8209;ordinate with the Iraqis and provide </p>
<p>Quick Reaction Forces, but the ISF would have daily policing and patrolling duties. </p>
<p><b>385. </b> Maj Gen Stewart in his evidence to the Inquiry reflected on the growing violence </p>
<p>by February/March.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p>“… because we had made Security Sector Reform our main effort … because it is </p>
<p>our ticket out of there eventually – we have seen a fight against what we are starting </p>
<p>to achieve in terms of Security Sector Reform.</p>
<p>“So there are people who are clearly unhappy at the police becoming even relatively </p>
<p>effective, because they never became anything close to being effective.”</p>
<p><b>386. </b> In April, the security situation declined dramatically, with uprisings in Fallujah and </p>
<p>Najaf, described in Section 9.2. Maj Gen Stewart told the Inquiry how “it was like a </p>
<p>switch had been flicked” on 6 April, when there were “35 shooting incidents and attacks </p>
<p>in Basra before 7.30 in the morning”.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Maj Gen Stewart described another incident on 21 April in which five simultaneous </p>
<p>car bombs were detonated in Basra and az&#8209;Zubayr, killing around 70 people and injuring </p>
<p>around 250. He said this was “all aimed at the Iraqi police because our SSR was </p>
<p>working”.</p>

<p>142</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Maj Gen Stewart explained that 50 percent of his force was assisting with SSR </p>
<p>during that time. He said that SSR continued in April (although it reduced to 25 percent </p>
<p>of his force’s time) but that “one or two of the major incidents we had was people … </p>
<p>actually moving from location to location to try and help the SSR”. </p>
<p><b>389. <i></b> Hard Lessons </i>summarised ISF performance during the violence of April 2004:</p>
<p>“Many elements of the newly deployed Iraqi Security Forces proved unwilling or </p>
<p>unable to fight. Some abandoned their posts and aided the insurgency. Others </p>
<p>mutinied when they came under fire. Iraqi police units collapsed in Fallujah, Najaf, </p>
<p>Karbala, and Kut, and the number of Iraqi police dropped by nearly 3,000 in one </p>
<p>week in April 2004. The Iraq Civil Defense Corps fared worst of all. From April 2 to </p>
<p>April 16, up to 12,000 ICDC members deserted; the rates reached up to 30 percent </p>
<p>in northeastern Iraq, 49 percent in Baghdad, 30 percent in the South&#8209;Central region, </p>
<p>and 82 percent in Western Iraq.”</p>
<p>336</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>390. </b> A summary produced for No.10 by the Cabinet Office in late April stated that the </p>
<p>Iraqi police were fully recruited against a target of 75,000 but that ICDC numbers, having </p>
<p>risen to 35,000 in early April, had subsequently fallen to 25,000.</p>
<p>337</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>391. </b> On 13 April, Mr Richmond reported that: </p>
<p>“The weaknesses in the new Iraqi Security Forces have been exposed by the events </p>
<p>of the last week. Bremer and Sanchez are keen on the [Iraqi] Defence Minister’s </p>
<p>idea of establishing a 10,000 man task force which would draw on some of the </p>
<p>‘non&#8209;tainted’ elements of the former regime’s special forces, the newly trained </p>
<p>counter terrorism company and Iraqi Army and ICDC battalions. They also want to </p>

<p>143</p>
<p><b>394. </b> On 23 April, Ambassador Bremer made a speech in Baghdad addressed to the </p>
<p>Iraqi people.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p>“… many Iraqis have complained to me that de&#8209;Ba’athification policy has been </p>
<p>applied unevenly and unjustly. I have looked into these complaints and they are </p>
<p>legitimate. The de&#8209;Ba’athification policy was and is sound. It does not need to be </p>
<p>changed. It is the right policy for Iraq. But it has been poorly implemented.”</p>
<p><b>395. </b> On 26 April, Mr Blair sent a Note to President Bush.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> In it he suggested a number </p>
<p>of ways of improving the situation in Iraq. The first suggestion was:</p>
<p>“Do whatever it takes to get the Civil Defence and police in shape. The Coalition </p>
<p>should hire who we need; pay what it takes; create an officer class that can lead </p>
<p>and knows that it has a huge vested interest in success. Bremer’s speech on </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification etc was well received. But I’m not sure we really have our entire </p>
<p>system focused on this; and it needs to be …”</p>
<p><b>396. </b> Mr Blair also suggested a focus on courts. He wrote:</p>
<p>“… very few cases can be tried at present; judges are subject to real intimidation. </p>
<p>We need to ensure that trials of criminals and sentencing begins again. An </p>
<p>independent judiciary will be a big step forward.”</p>
<p><b>397. </b> Those points were reiterated in a video conference on 27 April.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p><b>398. </b> In early May, following a request from Mr Blair to “look again at progress with </p>
<p>Iraqiisation, particularly training and equipment, and how it might be accelerated”, the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office produced a paper entitled ‘Enhancing Iraqi Security Forces’.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>Cabinet Office gave a detailed assessment of the current situation and highlighted the </p>
<p>following elements as the main points:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were benefits in taking risks in handing over local control to Iraqi citizens.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More ex&#8209;Ba’athist army officers might be required (beyond the 4,000&#8209;5,000 </p>
<p>there were already plans to recruit).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi police were fully recruited, the focus now needed to shift to specialist </p>
<p>and leadership training.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“10,000 Iraqi police” were “duds” and needed to be pensioned out of the service.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More police mentors were required; “we could consider lobbying internationally </p>

<p>ad hoc basis.”</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Mr Blair raised Iraqiisation again in a video conference with President Bush on </p>
<p>11 May.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> He questioned the current capability of the ISF, and concluded that a rolling </p>
<p>programme for Iraqiisation concentrating not just on numbers but on how to train, equip </p>
<p>and command the Iraqi police and ICDC, with the Iraqi Army behind them, was required.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> In a Note to President Bush on 18 May, Mr Blair described work on developing the </p>
<p>ISF as “urgent” and said that nothing should stand in its way.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> He provided a paper </p>
<p>from the MOD and highlighted the need:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for more international police advisers, stating that the current number was only </p>
<p>50 percent of that required;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for rapid recruitment of more army battalions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to “fix pay, equipment and IT problems of the police and civil defence”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to bring in “proper officers” even if they had a Ba’athist connection.</p>
<p><b>402. </b> From 20 to 23 May, a team led by Major General Nicholas Houghton, Assistant </p>
<p>Chief of Defence Staff (Operations), and accompanied by CC Kernaghan, visited Iraq.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The visit followed a request from Mr Blair for a UK team to visit Iraq and provide a report </p>
<p>on what further action was required to accelerate Iraqiisation.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>403. </b> Maj Gen Houghton’s subsequent report noted the lack of strategy, “bureaucratic </p>
<p>complexity” hindering access to funds and resources, “initiative overload” and a </p>
<p>short&#8209;term focus.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> However, he assessed that those mistakes were known in Iraq and </p>
<p>action had been taken to address them. He further stated:</p>
<p>“The last thing the theatre needs at the moment is novel thinking imposed from </p>
<p>outside. The concept of ‘acceleration’ is misplaced. ‘Sustained Effort’, with some </p>
<p>change in emphasis, will produce the desired capability.” </p>

<p><b>404. </b> Maj Gen Houghton also highlighted the need for “honest acceptance” of the likely </p>
<p>timescales, stating: </p>
<p>“The Iraqiisation of the Security Sector is not a deliverable on 01 July. It is a </p>
<p>possibility that a largely Iraqiised Security Sector could deliver security for elections </p>
<p>in Jan 05.” </p>
<p><b>405. </b> Maj Gen Houghton assessed: </p>
<p>“The biggest single thing that will move the creation of capability forward is the </p>
<p>increased use of military and police assets in mentoring roles. This should involve, </p>
<p>for example, widening the concept of embedding troops within Iraqi Civil Defence </p>
<p>Corps (ICDC) Units. Given available assets this will mean taking risk on maintaining </p>
<p>security.”</p>
<p><b>406. </b> On developing a strategy, Maj Gen Houghton stated that it must be “authored, </p>
<p>owned and executed” in Iraq, not in London. It should also deal with policy on militias </p>
<p>and define an end&#8209;state as there was no agreement on the constitutional, legal and </p>
<p>judicial framework within which the security sector should operate. He also highlighted </p>
<p>the difficulties that the transfer of sovereignty and the associated drawdown of the CPA </p>
<p>would have in terms of loss of control and discontinuity of personnel.</p>
<p><b>407. </b> In a “follow&#8209;up piece” to the paper, Maj Gen Houghton provided more detail on </p>
<p>how a strategy should be developed.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> The strategy should include a “vision”, such as: </p>
<p>“A secure and stable Iraq maintained by credible, self&#8209;confident and capable security </p>
<p>structures under Iraqi governance”. </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Derived from that vision should be an outline of the security sector architecture. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Houghton highlighted some “key policy decisions” that would need to be made </p>
<p>in each area:</p>
<p>“(1) Iraqi Police Service (IPS). There needs to be agreement on the principle of </p>
<p>Police Primacy (or not) in International Security (IS) issues. Will the Police Service </p>
<p>be controlled nationally or regionally? … Will it have a special weapons and tactics </p>
<p>capability; if so how much and under whose control? …</p>
<p>“(2) Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC). Is the ICDC a temporary or a permanent </p>
<p>creation? …</p>
<p>“(3) Iraqi Army. What is the role of the Iraqi Army in IS? …”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>409. </b> A series of “transition plans” would be required “to get us from where we are now </p>
<p>to where we want to be”. Those would include:</p>
<p>“(1) Capacity&#8209;building. Capacity&#8209;building plans for the elements of the Security </p>
<p>Sector are well advanced but they need greater refinement to reflect the need for </p>
<p>capability rather than just quantity …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“(3) Militias. There are assessed to be 52 militias ranging in size from 12 to 31,000. </p>
<p>They have represented useful short&#8209;term expedients, and some may need to feature </p>
<p>as part of the longer term accepted Security Architecture. A policy for militias is </p>
<p>starting to emerge.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“(6) Information Operations/Strategic Communications … extant plans have: focused </p>
<p>too much on 30 Jun as a watershed; … have dealt too much in promises and have </p>
<p>not focused enough on achievements and tangible successes.”</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Maj Gen Houghton judged that: “The time has already passed when a strategy </p>
<p>could have been imposed on the Iraqis and there is a danger that we may now be trying </p>
<p>to develop one too late.”</p>
<p><b>411. </b> On the most effective method of training, Maj Gen Houghton advised that:</p>
<p>“Evidence from within theatre indicates that the best way to grow genuine capability </p>
<p>within the ISF is to embed coalition troops and International Police Advisors (IPA) </p>
<p>inside Iraqi units.”</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Maj Gen Houghton provided some suggested points to stress in public statements, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>“(1) Significant progress already made in capability/capacity&#8209;building within ISF.</p>
<p>“(2) ISF already achieving local control in some areas …</p>
<p>“(3) Need to maintain a sensible balance of risk in progressing Iraqiisation with the </p>
<p>operation realities of the security situation. The relevant timescale is spring 06 for us </p>
<p>to assume strategic stand&#8209;off.”</p>
<p><b>413. </b> In an annex, Maj Gen Houghton described the status of SSR in Iraq as of 25 May:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Over 80,000 police officers were operational with approximately 20,000 having </p>
<p>received training. An accelerated training programme was now being put in </p>
<p>place by CPATT.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The DBE had been “successfully … reconstituted” (see Box, ‘The Iraqi border </p>
<p>police’, later in this Section).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On the FPS, the “manpower ceiling” of 73,992 had been achieved.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice had come under full Iraqi control on 30 May. The Higher </p>
<p>Judicial Council had been established in Baghdad and was processing up to </p>
<p>3,000 cases a week. The courts were functioning “reasonably well”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Correctional Service employed 3,269 officers and was operating </p>
<p>18 prison facilities, with a capacity of 5,500. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ICDC had 32,484 personnel, against a target of 40,680. Specialist </p>
<p>training had been hampered by a lack of equipment, such as communications </p>
<p>equipment.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Armed Forces had originally been established for external security </p>
<p>only. Four battalions had been trained for the Army, with additional personnel </p>
<p>in the Air Force and Coastal Defence Force.</p>
<p><b>414. </b> On resourcing, Maj Gen Houghton commented:</p>
<p>“The SSR process to date has been stifled by bureaucratic rules of the release of </p>
<p>funds. If we are to be serious about sustaining the process of Iraqiisation of the </p>
<p>Security Sector we need to take a pragmatic and flexible approach to the allocation </p>
<p>of a combined UK source of some £37 million.”</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Blair held a meeting on 3 June at which a paper from the MOD was </p>
<p>discussed.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> It is not clear from the record which MOD paper was considered. </p>
<p>Mr Blair agreed that a UK team should deploy to Iraq to act “in effect as the embryonic </p>
<p>secretariat of the MCNS [Ministerial Committee for National Security, described later in </p>
<p>this Section] and draft the equivalent of a white paper</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> on defence and security”.</p>
<p><b>416. </b> Mr Blair asked to be informed of “<i>any</i> obstacles or log jams” which he might need </p>
<p>to raise with President Bush and commissioned a round&#8209;up on Iraqiisation every two </p>
<p>weeks. Increased mentoring was not mentioned in the record of the discussion. </p>
<p><b>417. </b> Mr Blair also commissioned an update “illustrating what is actually happening in </p>
<p>MND(SE) in terms of handing over responsibility for security to the Iraqis”. The response </p>
<p>from the MOD is discussed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Two weeks later Mr Blair again discussed Iraqiisation and again requested to be </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>419. </b> In five meetings and conversations with President Bush in May and June, Mr Blair </p>
<p>raised Iraqiisation; emphasising the importance he attached to the approach and his </p>
<p>hope that Lt Gen Petraeus, now Commanding General, Multi&#8209;National Force – Iraq </p>
<p>(MNF&#8209;I subsumed OSC in June 2004), and Prime Minister Designate Ayad Allawi could </p>
<p>agree a joint plan for publication.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>420. </b> On 16 June, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a Note written by Mr Blair for </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> Mr Blair envisaged that the timetable and strategy in relation to Iraq </p>
<p>would include the Iraqi Interim Government publishing an “action plan on Iraqiisation </p>
<p>of Iraq’s security” in the week before handover and an international conference in early </p>
<p>September. Mr Blair wrote that the problem on Iraqiisation was “obvious”:</p>
<p>“The numbers in the police are there. But not the quality or equipment, e.g. only </p>
<p>7,000 of the 80,000 police are Academy trained: 62,000 have no training; only </p>
<p>nine percent have proper body armour; only 30 percent of the required vehicles are </p>
<p>in place. Apparently the logjam on resources and equipment is now broken. But it </p>
<p>will take time. And the Iraqi Army isn’t really started yet.</p>
<p>“All of this is now urgent.”</p>
<p><b>421. </b> According to <i>Hard Lessons</i>, at the end of June 2004 only half of Iraq’s army and </p>
<p>two&#8209;thirds of its police forces had received any training at all, and the quality of that </p>
<p>training “varied wildly”.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Reintegrating militias</b></p>
<p>In May 2004, Mr Richmond reported that the CPA had begun to implement a “pragmatic” </p>
<p>strategy to reintegrate the militias into Iraqi society.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> The plan was to recruit militia </p>
<p>personnel into the ISF, to retire them with a pension or to reintegrate them through a </p>
<p>training and job placement scheme.</p>
<p>The largest militia groups were the two Kurdish Peshmerga (the Kurdistan Democratic </p>
<p>Party had an estimated strength of 41,000 and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 31,000) </p>
<p>and the Badr Corps (16,000). Other smaller militia, such as the Dawa, the Iraqi National </p>
<p>Accord and the Iraqi National Congress, tended to consist largely of security personnel </p>
<p>protecting their respective political leaders. </p>

<p>There were also “unofficial” militias which were meant to be dismantled. Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi </p>
<p>(JAM) was judged to be “the most dangerous” of those. Mr Richmond commented that </p>
<p>dismantling militias was “Not an easy task as we have discovered”. He concluded his </p>
<p>report to London:</p>
<p>“It is easy to be sceptical about how quickly and effectively the militias will be </p>
<p>dismantled. There is an element of re&#8209;badging in the agreed approach but it is </p>
<p>probably the only realistic way forward. A system which brings militia members within </p>
<p>the ambit of the state, if only nominally, is better than leaving the problem unresolved. </p>
<p>It is also an important confidence building measure. Ultimately, militias will only </p>
<p>disappear when the economy is strong enough to offer people higher paid jobs </p>
<p>elsewhere and the political system is sufficiently stable to remove their raison d’etre.” </p>
<p>On 7 June, Ambassador Bremer signed CPA Order No.91, entitled “Regulation of Armed </p>
<p>Forces and Militias within Iraq”.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p> It prohibited the existence of armed forces and militias </p>
<p>other than those created by the CPA. Existing militia could remain only if they had a </p>
<p>“Transition and Reintegration” plan which included timescales for their disbandment </p>
<p>and a full list of members. Article 27 of the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) and </p>
<p>subsequently Article 9 of the Iraqi Constitution prohibited armed forces or militias that </p>
<p>were not part of the Iraqi Armed Forces.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An update to No.10 from the MOD in August 2004 stated: “The success of this </p>

<p>de&#8209;militarisation in future conflicts.” </p>

<p><b>425. </b> The MCNS met regularly from this point onwards and its meetings were often </p>

<p><b>426. </b> The role of National Security Adviser was to act as the primary adviser on national </p>

<p>al&#8209;Rubaie was appointed to that role in April 2004 and served until April 2009.</p>
<p><b>427. </b> A briefing from the MOD for No.10 in May described the following structures </p>

<p>Provincial and local structures, such as provincial security committees to discuss </p>
<p>“security issues in the broadest sense” (these became known as Provincial Joint </p>
<p>Co&#8209;ordination Centres – PJCCs) and local co&#8209;ordination structures known as </p>
<p>Joint Operating Centres.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Army and the ICDC would be under the command and control of the </p>

<p>need to be under the operational command and control of the MNF.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was uncertainty around police command and control but it was thought </p>
<p>that they would report through local police chiefs to the MOI. Ideally the police </p>

<p>straight away. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That transition to local control would occur at different speeds in different </p>

<p>MOI</p>
<p>September </p>
<p>2004</p>
<p>A lighter force which conducted </p>
<p>counter&#8209;insurgency operations but primarily </p>
<p>performed a traditional police function in very </p>
<p>hostile environments.</p>
<p>The Public Order Battalions were recruited </p>
<p>almost entirely from Shia neighbourhoods around </p>
<p>Baghdad and locations in southern Iraq and </p>
<p>were not under Multi&#8209;National Security Transition </p>
<p>Command – Iraq<b> (</b>MNSTC&#8209;I) supervision. They </p>
<p>were later regarded by Sunnis as evidence of </p>
<p>Shia abuse of their power as head of the MOI.</p>
<p>370</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>430. </b> The creation of “elite” forces within the MOI led to two types of police – national </p>
<p>(although not formally badged as the “National Police” until April 2006; see Box, ‘The </p>
<p>National Police’, later in this Section) and local. The national&#8209;type police forces (elite </p>
<p>forces) reported directly to the Minister of Interior, while the local forces reported through </p>
<p>a Provincial Director of Police to a Deputy Minister in the MOI responsible for policing. </p>
<p><b>431. </b> Coalition military structures were also re&#8209;organised in preparation for the transfer </p>
<p>of sovereignty. Part of that re&#8209;organisation subsumed the Office of Security Co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>(OSC) into the Multi&#8209;National Security Transition Command – Iraq<b> </b>(MNSTC&#8209;I).</p>
<p>371</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Multi&#8209;National Security Transition Command – Iraq</b></p>
<p>The Multi&#8209;National Security Transition Command – Iraq<b> </b>(MNSTC&#8209;I) came into existence </p>
<p>on 6 June 2004 and was led by Lt Gen Petraeus.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MNSTC&#8209;I was organised into three training teams:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Coalition Military Assistance Training Team (CMATT) – to organise, train and </p>
<p>equip the Iraqi Army;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Joint Headquarters Advisory Support Team (JHQ&#8209;ST) – to assist the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army command and control system; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Civilian Police Assistance Training Team (CPATT) – to organise, train and </p>
<p>equip the Iraqi Police.</p>
<p>The UK also provided a training team of approximately 10 personnel to MNSTC&#8209;I to </p>
<p>carry out Basic Officer Training.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> The UK training team became part of the NATO </p>

<p><b>SSR in the South: after the invasion</b></p>
<p><b>Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East)</b></p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) (MND(SE)) was established on 12 July.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>formalised the UK’s responsibility for maintaining security in the provinces of Basra, </p>
<p>Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan, initially as an Occupying Power and, from June 2004, </p>
<p>in support of the Iraqi Government. That area of Iraq is often referred to as ‘the South’.</p>
<p><b>432. </b> On 14 April, Mr Blair told the House of Commons that the South of Iraq was </p>
<p>“largely under British control”.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> In Basra:</p>
<p>“About 200 policemen have reported for work. Joint patrols started on 13 April. In </p>
<p>surrounding towns, looting has either ceased or is declining, local patrols are being </p>
<p>re&#8209;established and co&#8209;operation with city councils is going well.”</p>
<p><b>433. </b> In response to a question from Mr Iain Duncan Smith, the Leader of the </p>
<p>Opposition, Mr Blair told Members of Parliament (MPs):</p>
<p>“Of course the British forces will stay until there is proper security in the country, </p>
<p>although obviously we hope to ensure that some of the policing is done by local </p>
<p>people as soon as possible. That is why it is encouraging that joint patrols are </p>
<p>already taking place. Although people may find this strange, much of the problem for </p>
<p>Iraqi citizens came from the special security forces, not the ordinary civil police, if I </p>
<p>may put it like that. Many of those people could perform an adequate and good task </p>
<p>for the future of Iraq. Other countries are already offering help in relation to policing </p>
<p>and security.”</p>
<p>376</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>434. </b> Responding to a proposal by Mr Jeffrey M Donaldson that the UK should draw </p>
<p>on the experience of retired Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers to police Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Blair said: </p>
<p>“We should look at using retired RUC officers. Indeed, the Defence Secretary </p>
<p>tells me that representatives of our UK police have gone out to Iraq to see what </p>
<p>assistance we can give.”</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>435. </b> Pressed by Mr Nicholas Soames to “take seriously” Mr Donaldson’s point, Mr Blair </p>
<p>added that deploying former officers was “a priority for us, because the better we can </p>
<p>maintain order, the better it is for the people of Iraq and the less is the pressure on our </p>
<p>soldiers”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>436. </b> From early April, policing functions in MND(SE) were undertaken by the </p>
<p>military, under a Royal Military Police (RMP) lead.</p>
<p>379</p>
<p> Following his visit to Iraq in May, </p>
<p>CC Kernaghan observed that “local volunteers had been recruited as auxiliaries and that </p>
<p>they, together with elements of the Saddam Hussein era police, were being trained by </p>
<p>the RMP in the basics of police work”. Plans were in place to refurbish police stations, </p>
<p>courts and prisons; to provide basic training to officers who had reported back or had </p>
<p>been recruited since the invasion; to select and issue new uniforms; and to re&#8209;establish </p>
<p>a viable local criminal justice system. </p>
<p><b>437. </b> CC Kernaghan judged that “the British effort was focused on providing a visible </p>
<p>police presence on the streets to reassure the wider population”.</p>
<p><b>438. </b> By early July, the military had appointed a Chief of Police and outlined plans to </p>
<p>develop a training academy in az&#8209;Zubayr, near Basra.</p>
<p>380</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>439. </b> The Dutch Marechaussee (Royal Military Constabulary) and Italian Carabinieri </p>
<p>(National Military Police) were also deployed in Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces </p>
<p>respectively. They undertook basic training and mentoring of Iraqi police in their areas. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Stewart told the Inquiry that the Carabinieri were “just the right sort of troops </p>
<p>to help train [the Iraqis]”.</p>
<p>381</p>
<p><b>440. </b> A record of a meeting on 25 June between the FCO, ACPO and the Home Office </p>
<p>stated: </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister was authoritatively quoted as wishing to see the southern AO … </p>
<p>develop as an exemplar for the whole of Iraq. The Iraq Policy Unit (IPU) made it </p>
<p>clear that HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] recognised the need to make progress </p>
<p>in advance of any agreed CPA strategy [on SSR]. Specifically, in respect of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Armed Forces and the police.”</p>
<p>382</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Basra River Service</b></p>
<p>By June, British commanders had instigated the creation of the “Basra River Service” to </p>
<p>employ ex&#8209;naval personnel. Major General Adrian Bradshaw, Commander 7 Armoured </p>
<p>Brigade in 2003, told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“In the weeks after our arrival, we became very aware that the ex&#8209;naval and military </p>
<p>personnel in the province, of whom there were 10,000 or 12,000, had also not been </p>
<p>paid for several months and were facing a desperate situation and … they came to us </p>
<p>asking for us to do something about their people …</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>“It was clear to me that what was at that stage developing into quite a sort of robust </p>
<p>peaceful protest had the potential to go a lot further … So I proposed … that we </p>
<p>should effectively demobilise these people with a demobilisation payment and then </p>
<p>take them on … as 10,000 more on the 180,000 civil sector workers with a marker </p>
<p>against their name to be part of the future security structure and almost immediately </p>
<p>then we started employing them in a force that we created called the Basra River </p>
<p>Service which was designed to promote security on the waterway, along which a </p>
<p>vast amount of looted copper and brass ingots were being spirited away into a sort </p>
<p>of open black market in the Gulf and tons of steel from cables and all manner of </p>
<p>material.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>441. </b> July saw a substantial reduction of military personnel within South&#8209;East Iraq, </p>
<p>including a reduction in RMP platoons from eight to two (approximately 800 to </p>
<p>200 personnel).</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Problems deploying police officers</b></p>
<p><b>442. </b> Following the agreement for the UK to provide a Chief Constable to be the senior </p>
<p>policing adviser to the CPA within the MOI, officials in the FCO continued to recommend </p>
<p>the deployment of around 20 MOD police officers.</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>443. </b> It appears that that deployment was first mentioned to CPA(South) on 7 June when </p>
<p>an email was sent from the UND to a junior official who was seconded to CPA(South).</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The official’s response was that it would not be feasible for the MOD police officers to </p>
<p>come under CPA(South) as they had no authority to manage the responsibility, and no </p>
<p>ability to provide security. </p>
<p><b>444. </b> The IPU was concerned that that might prove a stumbling block: they were keen </p>
<p>to ensure that the MOD police officers had some responsibility to the CPA’s policing </p>
<p>team in Baghdad.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>445. </b> As a result, they began to consider providing CPA(South) with “a secondee </p>
<p>with specific responsibility for policing/SSR”.</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> That idea was strongly welcomed by </p>
<p>CPA(South).</p>
<p><b>446. </b> In June, the FCO agreed to appoint ACC Douglas Brand from the South Yorkshire </p>
<p>Constabulary to the post of Senior Police Adviser to the CPA in Baghdad (as described </p>

<p>to send MOD Police to begin basic training for police in Basra”, adding “this … will </p>
<p>subsequently be subsumed into an international policing team working in accordance </p>
<p>with an agreed coalition policing strategy”. It highlighted that the UK had offered two </p>
<p>Assistant Chief Constables to help develop the policing strategy, one in Baghdad, the </p>
<p>other in Basra.</p>
<p>391</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>448. </b> The AHMGIR met on 12 June and Ministers agreed that the MOD police contingent </p>
<p>should deploy to Basra as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>392</p>

<p><b>449. </b> The UND asked the MOD’s Iraq Secretariat to action this, stating that it would be </p>
<p>for the RMP’s Provost Marshal</p>

<p>that contingent of police officers, who would be “reliant on military support for board, </p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the meeting it was agreed that, instead of deploying the full contingent of 21 MOD </p>
<p>officers, DCC White would deploy with three or four MOD police/PSNI officers and </p>
<p>conduct a training needs analysis. </p>
<p><b>451. </b> CC Kernaghan stated that the only request for UK civilian police secondees </p>
<p>that had been relayed to ACPO at that time was for the two ACCs (ACC White and </p>
<p>ACC Brand). He highlighted the pressures on the domestic police service and the </p>
<p>limitations on its ability to provide large numbers of armed officers, noting that “any </p>
<p>request would require clear political approval and endorsement” before ACPO could </p>
<p>consider it, but added that ACPO “would seek to respond positively to UK Government </p>
<p>requests and had specialist capabilities, which might play a constructive role in police </p>
<p>reform generally”.</p>

<p>to seek nominations of up to 200 police officers for firearms training with a view to </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>453. </b> On 18 July, Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blunkett requesting the nomination of a pool of </p>

<p>397</p>

<p><b>459. </b> An IPU update for Mr Blair on 3 September stated: </p>
<p>“In addition to the senior UK police officers already in Iraq, 15 UK trainers can be </p>
<p>deployed within two weeks and another 60 by the end of October. Our target is </p>
<p>100 UK trainers deployed by end 2003 (of a planned CPA total of 600).”</p>

<p> He also stated that the FCO had not – at that point – conducted the risk </p>

<p>they promised a great deal … in fact delivery was always the problem”.</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Lt Gen Lamb said that his “sense was there was no shortage of individuals who </p>
<p>were prepared to volunteer” but Chief Constables were “reluctant” and “did not allow </p>
<p>them to come forward” because they felt it would be a breach of their duty of care given </p>
<p>the difficult security situation. </p>
<p><b>463. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott agreed that he perceived a “tremendous reluctance” from ACPO </p>
<p>to supply police officers.</p>

<p><b>464. </b> In late September 2003, both DCC Brand and DCC White expressed their </p>

<p>408</p>
<p> On 21 September, </p>
<p>in response to being informed that the FCO was considering asking the PSNI to provide </p>
<p>the four staff he requested in August, DCC Brand wrote:</p>
<p>“… I don’t mind where they come from as long as they get here ASAP. The JCC </p>
<p>[Joint Command Centre] is now being seen by the military as the only current </p>
<p>solution to the problem of soldiers shooting Iraqi police officers because of a lack </p>
<p>of awareness of deployments … They [the military] have everything in place … </p>
<p>I made my original request … <b>6 weeks ago</b> … If we are only just thinking about </p>
<p>approaching PSNI it may be weeks or months before the officers are able to travel </p>
<p>and we would lose all credibility with the American military … To remind you, </p>
<p><b>this was our idea</b> … I urge you to act swiftly and not delay any longer.”</p>

<p><b>465. </b> The following day, DCC White wrote to a junior official in the FCO’s Iraq Security </p>
<p>Sector Unit, to summarise his understanding of the position in MND(SE) ahead of a </p>
<p>briefing with Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Sir Hilary Synnott:</p>
<p>“… I would like to be able to tell them that I have been updated by FCO in relation </p>
<p>to: my resource bids other than training staff (I am assuming they are not being </p>
<p>addressed); MDP [MOD police] deployments to Basra (I am assuming they are not </p>
<p>being deployed); training staff requests for mid October (I am certain they are not </p>
<p>being met); and training staff requests for Nov/Dec (it appears they are not likely </p>
<p>to be met).” </p>
<p>410</p>
<p><b>466. </b> He summed up by saying:</p>
<p>“Those of us on the ground are finding it difficult to fully understand what the main </p>
<p>issues of the debate are regarding the deployment or otherwise of UK civpol.”</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Upon receiving those emails, CC Kernaghan wrote to the Home Office to clarify the </p>
<p>ACPO position.</p>
<p>411</p>
<p> He made clear that there were “no outstanding requests with ACPO, </p>
<p>nor have any been refused to date”. He stated that current delays were due to a lack </p>
<p>of firearms training and that deployment without such training would require a “clear </p>
<p>statement from the Home Office that such a move was seen as desirable”. He also said </p>
<p>that he had “no doubt” that the FCO’s International Policing Unit could expedite selection </p>
<p>and training if directed. He concluded by saying:</p>
<p>“In essence, the FCO, with the support of allied departments and agencies, needs </p>
<p>to provide quicker and more authoritative feedback to DB &amp; SW [DCCs Brand </p>
<p>and White].”</p>
<p><b>468. </b> On 4 October, Ms Clwyd asked Mr Straw in a House of Commons debate </p>
<p>when he intended to “strengthen the number of British advisers and support staff”. </p>
<p>Mr Straw responded, saying that he intended to investigate the matter and that it was </p>
<p>his understanding that “from this week, DCC White will be supported in his role by </p>
<p>six Ministry of Defence police officers”.</p>
<p>412</p>

<p>from 2002. The letter said that for domestic reasons the PSNI would no longer be in a </p>
<p>position to contribute to overseas police missions. </p>
<p><b>471. </b> On 6 November, Ms Jane Kennedy, Minister of State for Northern Ireland, wrote </p>
<p>to Mr Straw stating that Mr Orde had agreed to identify at least six and up to 10 “PSNI </p>

<p>with the military willing to undertake a secondment to Basra”.</p>
<p>415</p>

<p><b>472. </b> In a visit report dated 18 November (described earlier in this Section), CC </p>
<p>Kernaghan recommended an increase in UK police officers deployed to both Baghdad </p>
<p>and Basra.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> He highlighted that only 27 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales – </p>
<p>and six of the eight in Scotland – had nominated officers to serve in Iraq. He welcomed </p>
<p>the willingness of the Northern Ireland Office/PSNI to deploy police officers to Iraq but </p>
<p>cautioned that the PSNI should not be seen as a separate entity. In particular he was </p>
<p>concerned that they should not be expected to take greater risks than other UK police </p>
<p>officers.</p>
<p><b>473. </b> The development of police training across Iraq is discussed in Box, ‘Police training </p>

<p>be deployed by the end of December and that other troop&#8209;contributing nations should be </p>
<p>encouraged to send trainers.</p>
<p>418</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>475. </b> The minutes of the meeting stated: </p>
<p>“The Home Secretary and ACPO were content in principle with the deployment of </p>
<p>UK police trainers … This could happen … before the end of October. However … </p>
<p>[they] would need to see a plan for the school including a security assessment, and </p>
<p>a more defined strategy for policing than existed at present.”</p>
<p>419</p>
<p><b>476. </b> At that stage, deployment of UK police officers for the facility was being delayed </p>
<p>by lack of firearms training or adequate security provisions for them to deploy without </p>

<p><b>477. </b> The Iraq Senior Officials Group met on 23 September and stated that the FCO </p>
<p>was sifting applications and hoped to supply 80 trainers for the Jordan school and 20 for </p>
<p>training in az&#8209;Zubayr; no timelines for deployment were provided.</p>

<p><b>478. </b> At an Iraq Policing Meeting on 24 October, it was agreed that FCO officials should </p>

<p>“I was shocked when he [Mr Straw] told me that he was being told that; there </p>
<p>were no delays in getting police out to Basra (in fact none had arrived since my </p>
<p>advance party came to the place in July, despite requests and reports); that there </p>
<p>was no sleeping accommodation for UK police in CPA South (as there were many </p>
<p>Portakabins available such as the one I lived in); and that the police academy was </p>
<p>not ready (as it had been open and functioning since mid October and all I needed </p>
<p>were some more police to help us open and use the many other empty classrooms). </p>
<p>This final point was frustrating to hear, because to my memory only one person </p>
<p>(a military officer attached to an FCO Iraq unit) had visited it and, in what was a </p>
<p>classic ‘Catch 22’ situation, it appeared that (in UK) some were saying it was not </p>
<p>open to justify not deploying trainers – yet the reason why it was not open was </p>
<p>because no trainers were deployed to it.”</p>
<p>424</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>481. </b> Following his visit, Mr Straw wrote to Mr John Sawers, Political Director in the </p>

<p>“I would be grateful if you would personally grip this issue and ensure that the </p>
<p>key action points arising from CC Kernaghan’s report of his Iraq trip are dealt with </p>
<p>as soon as possible. A combination of the Byzantine bureaucracy of ACPO and </p>
<p>a lack of understanding in the FCO about police issues and practice … threaten </p>

<p>contribution to make.”</p>
<p>425</p>
<p><b>482. </b> On the same day, Mr Straw told the AHMGIR that the “UK contribution to policing </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>483. </b> On 28 November, more than two months after applications were sifted, Mr Straw </p>
<p>wrote to Mr Blunkett formally requesting the deployment of 24 officers to work at the  </p>
<p>az&#8209;Zubayr training academy, noting that ACPO was content with the risk assessment.</p>
<p>427</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>484. </b> Mr Blunkett agreed to that request on 3 December.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>485. </b> In a letter to No.10 in mid&#8209;December, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary reported that </p>
<p>the 24 additional British officers would arrive at az&#8209;Zubayr that week.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p> He also reported </p>
<p>that 36 officers had deployed to Jordan and a further 40 were on standby to join once </p>
<p>capacity had been increased. In addition:</p>
<p>“The UK’s senior input to Iraq policing remains strong. DCC Douglas Brand, </p>
<p>senior police adviser in the CPA is responsible for overall policing strategy and </p>
<p>implementation, and will be in place for a further 6 months. In the South, ACC </p>
<p>Stephen White will be replaced from end January. Both officers’ teams are currently </p>
<p>being strengthened.” </p>
<p><b>486. </b> The UK police trainers arrived and training began on 27 December.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p> The military </p>
<p>also supplied two lieutenant colonels as members of the project team and 20 trainers </p>
<p>(10 Royal Military Police (RMP) and 10 Carabinieri). Following discussions with the </p>
<p>military and the senior adviser to MOI, Mr Casteel, it was agreed that the military and UK </p>
<p>police officers would share responsibility for training at the az&#8209;Zubayr facility.</p>
<p><b>487. </b> By March 2004 there were over 100 UK police officers working on SSR: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>two senior police advisers (DCC Brand in Baghdad and Acting ACC Philip Read </p>
<p>in Basra); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>their support staff of 11, including staff manning the Baghdad joint civil&#8209;military </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordination cell; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>73 officers in Jordan (eight of whom were retired officers); </p>

<p>as senior police adviser in Basra and served a seven&#8209;month tour.</p>

<p> He described the </p>

<p>to mentor the police commanders in Maysan province, Nasiriyah and Basra. There were </p>
<p>further police officers in Baghdad working on future planning for the police service in Iraq </p>
<p>but “they had been all but marginalised by our US allies and were effectively ignored”. </p>
<p>He likened the arrangements for SSR in Iraq to “being in a rowing boat being towed </p>

<p>charts and plans in the police rowing boat”.</p>
<p>THE DEPLOYMENT OF DCC WHITE</p>
<p><b>489. </b> DCC White had deployed to Basra on 14 July 2003. He described the security </p>
<p>situation upon arrival as: </p>
<p>“… bad and … getting worse. There had been tragedies … there was no accurate </p>
<p>data of how many people were being killed, but there were many people being </p>
<p>killed. Old scores were being settled. Bodies were being found in the Shatt&#8209;Al&#8209;Arab </p>
<p>River and in the parks and so on. So within the community, there was a lot of </p>
<p>violence. In terms of the threat against the Coalition Forces, it was also rising … but, </p>
<p>having come from working in Northern Ireland for 30 years, it was not, in my opinion, </p>
<p>any worse.”</p>
<p>433</p>
<p><b>490. </b> DCC White was accompanied by two MOD Police officers who would be his only </p>
<p>UK police resources for most of the next five months.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> He also worked with Danish </p>
<p>police officers, initially a contingent of three which grew to a maximum of 15 by the end </p>
<p>of 2003.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… you had the ridiculous situation where, as a very senior chief police officer, I was </p>
<p>flying on my own to the scene of murders … If you have only got one British police </p>
<p>officer and two Ministry of Defence police officers, for five months, what does that </p>
<p>say about the priority being given to the situation? Despite the fact – the rhetoric </p>
<p>was: the South must not fail, the South must be a success.”</p>
<p> 436</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>491. </b> DCC White’s lines of reporting were multiple – to Mr Kerik in Baghdad, to </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott in Basra and to a junior official in the FCO’s UND. </p>
<p><b>492. </b> Despite DCC White initially being offered an operational role, he was subsequently </p>
<p>briefed in London that his role was to be “primarily as policing adviser” but eventually he </p>
<p>might become police commander before handing over to the Iraqi police.</p>
<p>437</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>493. </b> DCC White’s role changed again on arrival in Basra where he found himself </p>
<p>expected to assume the role of CPA Director of Security (Law and Order), encompassing </p>
<p>not just security and policing but all other aspects of criminal justice. That was a </p>
<p>much broader role than anticipated. He had one lawyer to support the work on judicial </p>
<p>reform.</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>494. </b> Describing how he was briefed by the military on their future plans, Former ACC </p>
<p>White told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“[I] was impressed with the comprehensiveness of the plan but somewhat surprised </p>
<p>that [I] had not been told of it back in the UK.”</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>495. </b> Former ACC White told the Inquiry that he was viewed by the military in MND(SE) </p>
<p>as “their relief – from all law and order reform duties – not just police reform. This </p>
<p>expectation was … the cause of much tension throughout my tour of duty”. </p>
<p><b>496. </b> Former ACC White explained: “The army were trying to move away from policing </p>
<p>duties. They wanted us [police secondees] to move in and we weren’t there.”</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>497. </b> Former ACC White described a confused strategic picture: </p>
<p>“I was being told that a strategy was still being written and therefore not </p>
<p>promulgated. However, I was also told there were advanced plans – e.g. for training </p>
<p>in Hungary with agreed curricula. Later in Baghdad I saw a Bosnia police training </p>
<p>curricula with the word Bosnia struck out and Iraq written on it. I was being told at </p>
<p>one time the IPTF [International Police Training Force] for which I had been recruited </p>
<p>as commander would be unlikely, yet the man in charge of MOI and policing in </p>
<p>Iraq was telling me directly I would have 1,500 officers, with executive authority, to </p>
<p>command in the South.”</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>498. </b> In August, DCC White produced a ‘Strategic Report on the Police Reform </p>
<p>Programme in Southern Iraq’ in which he assessed that 91 international police officers </p>
<p>would be required to support the policing mission within MND(SE), of whom 70 would </p>
<p>work with the Iraqi police and 21 would operate within the training school.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> In addition </p>
<p>to those, following the UK military decision to withdraw the four RMP personnel who had </p>
<p>been working as part of DCC White’s team and providing force protection for the UK </p>
<p>police, he estimated that a team of 48 would be required to provide force protection. </p>

<p> The request for 91 police officers was subsequently </p>

<p>to support his work in MND(SE).</p>
<p><b>501. </b> The Iraq Security Action Plan, produced by the IPU for the Iraq Senior Officials </p>
<p>Group in September 2003, recorded that “in the absence of a central [policing] strategy, </p>
<p>we are pursuing regional options”.</p>
<p>444</p>
<p><b>502. </b> DCC White had submitted a proposal to re&#8209;establish the Regional Police Training </p>
<p>Academy (RPTA) at az&#8209;Zubayr to the south of Basra, to be staffed by 21 international </p>
<p>staff (see Box, ‘Police training academies’, earlier in this Section). Plans to train Iraqi </p>
<p>officers in Hungary had fallen through, but three potential training sites had been </p>
<p>identified in Jordan, with facilities for up to 3,000 recruits. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> The IPU recommended that DCC Brand should clear the UK’s concept for the </p>
<p>RPTA with the CPA and MOI; that it should be funded; and that its timetable should be </p>
<p>accelerated. Twenty&#8209;one UK officers were expected to be deployed to the Academy </p>
<p>by the end of December. The IPU was confident that it could offer 100 officers to work </p>
<p>in a training facility in a third country by the end of October, but needed to lobby the </p>
<p>Jordanians for access to such facilities. </p>
<p><b>504. </b> Ministers discussed policing at the AHMGIR on 18 September.</p>
<p>445</p>
<p> The Annotated </p>
<p>Agenda for the meeting described plans to develop the RPTA, stating that “a separate </p>
<p>deployment of 20 UK police trainers, who will require firearms training, will be required”. </p>
<p>That deployment would require the formal approval of ACPO and the Home Office.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>505. </b> Ministers “endorsed the plans for police training outlined in the Annotated Agenda </p>

<p>help was necessary”.</p>
<p>447</p>
<p><b>506. </b> In September, a cross&#8209;Whitehall project team was created to oversee the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>The team, which included seconded police officers as well as officials from the Home </p>
<p>Office and MOD, was set up to co&#8209;ordinate the work of a virtual team of advisers from </p>
<p>ACPO, the Home Office, the MOD police and Bramshill College of Policing. It reported </p>
<p>to the Iraq Senior Officials Group.</p>
<p><b>507. </b> A briefing by the Iraq Police Training Project Team on 18 September stated that </p>
<p>the first course at az&#8209;Zubayr was due to begin on 15 October, with specialised training </p>
<p>courses being carried out by Danish police officers.</p>
<p>449</p>
<p> At the same time, the facility was </p>
<p>being expanded so that it could accommodate larger courses and begin three&#8209;week </p>
<p>‘Transition Integration Programme’ training. The expansion was due to be completed </p>
<p>in December. </p>
<p><b>Training the ICDC in MND(SE)</b></p>
<p>In July 2003, military commanders from each of the areas in Iraq were instructed </p>
<p>to stand up ICDC battalions. In response to that, in early September an MOD force </p>
<p>level review concluded that a further two UK battalions should be sent to Iraq, one of </p>
<p>which would begin training of the ICDC in MND(SE) alongside force protection and </p>
<p>intelligence&#8209;gathering/surveillance duties.</p>
<p>450</p>
<p> The review did not make clear what proportion </p>
<p>of the battalion (around 600 strong in total) would be involved in training the ICDC.</p>
<p>The UK ICDC training team arrived in theatre in late September with the aim of training </p>
<p>1,200 troops by mid&#8209;October, and 5,000 in total, for deployment in MND(SE).</p>
<p>451</p>
<p>In the Security Action Plan written in September 2003, the IPU recorded that UK forces </p>
<p>were training 160 members of the ICDC, and that would increase to 1,700 by early </p>
<p>November.</p>
<p>452</p>
<p> ICDC battalions would be “fully operational” by the end of the year in all four </p>
<p>provinces of MND(SE), carrying out basic guarding and infantry tasks. </p>
<p>The IPU identified four actions required:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provision of additional UK Short Term Training Teams;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allocation of a delegated budget to MND(SE) to support the training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provision of CJTF and CPA central support; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreement that ICDC development costs should be underwritten nationally in </p>
<p>order to avoid “procedural delays in CPA”. </p>
<p><b>508. </b> In October, Sir Hilary Synnott reported that CJTF&#8209;7 had issued an unexpected </p>
<p>instruction entitled ‘Acceleration of the Iraqi Police Services’ which gave the military </p>
<p>a greater role in accelerated police training programmes. That is described earlier in </p>
<p>this Section.</p>

<p>“In the South, this has considerable implications for military resources to be devoted </p>
<p>to police training; for our current plans, including the recently inaugurated Basra </p>

<p>future. We had no warning of this from CPA Baghdad (beyond a slight reference </p>
<p>to such a possibility), no subsequent information from them and no consultation.”</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Sir Hilary explained that he had come up with an action plan to adapt the </p>
<p>approach being taken in the South in such a way as to be consistent with the instruction, </p>
<p>cautioning:</p>
<p>“It will require an acceleration of the current building programme for the Police </p>
<p>Academy and enhanced and extended engagement by the RMP. It will not negate </p>
<p>the need for UK civil police involvement and, to enhance the civil nature of policing, </p>
<p>it would be desirable to extend this further as soon as practicable. But the nature of </p>

<p><b>512. </b> Lt Gen Reith described the purpose of his paper as “to summarise SSR progress </p>

<p>455</p>
<p> He informed readers that:</p>

<p><b>513. </b> Lt Gen Reith described eight separate Iraqi security organisations, including the </p>

<p>168</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>282 Border Police and Customs officials had been recruited, out of a total of </p>
<p>1,500 planned by February 2004.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>180 members of the Iraqi Riverine Patrol Service (IRPS), out of the 380 planned </p>

<p>Recruitment for the 392&#8209;strong Iraqi Coastal Defence Force, which would be </p>
<p>responsible for security in Iraqi territorial waters and anti&#8209;smuggling activity, </p>
<p>would begin in two weeks. </p>
<p><b>514. </b> Lt Gen Reith wrote that over the following 12 months only four elements of the </p>
<p>ISF would relieve Coalition Forces of tasks: the IPS, ICDC, IRPS and FPS. It was “too </p>
<p>early to judge the effectiveness or quality of these units, but the ‘Iraqiisation factor’ </p>
<p>alone is expected to gain popular support”. Although other elements of the ISF would </p>
<p>help to improve the security situation, Lt Gen Reith felt there was “little likelihood that </p>

<p><b>515. </b> On 14 October, a documentary entitled ‘Basra Beat’ which followed DCC White’s </p>
<p>deployment in Iraq was broadcast by BBC Northern Ireland’s <i>Spotlight</i> programme.</p>
<p>456</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The programme exposed DCC White’s concerns about the SSR programme in Iraq, and </p>
<p>the UK’s resourcing of it. </p>
<p><b>516. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Former ACC White explained that, in particular, </p>
<p>a remark he made about his frustration with the delays in deploying officers caused </p>
<p>controversy back in the UK.</p>
<p>457</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry that as a result many “negative </p>
<p>opinions were offered” about him and that he was left “feeling unsupported and isolated” </p>
<p>but for the support of Sir Hilary Synnott and Ms Kennedy.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> An update from Mr Straw’s Private Secretary to Sir Nigel Sheinwald on 17 October </p>
<p>did not refer to the issues raised by DCC White’s documentary.</p>

<p>reported that “good progress” was being made in developing the Iraqi police and that </p>
<p>there was a “credible and deliverable strategy to train 30,000 Iraqi police over the </p>
<p>next year”.</p>
<p><b>518. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary reported that efforts in Basra were focused </p>
<p>on developing the Regional Police Training Academy (RPTA) and that an “initial </p>
<p>retraining programme for serving Iraqi police officers began on 12 October under UK </p>
<p>management”. He reported that 24 UK police officers were about to start pre&#8209;deployment </p>
<p>training and would deploy as soon as the RPTA facilities were ready to receive them. </p>
<p>That would bring the total deployment of UK officers in Basra and Jordan to 100. </p>

<p><b>519. </b> DCC White met Mr Rammell, Mr Adam Ingram, Minister for the Armed Forces, </p>
<p>and Ms Kennedy on 3 November.</p>
<p>459</p>
<p> In the meeting, DCC White stated that his alleged </p>
<p>criticisms of government strategy were taken out of context but he expressed concerns </p>
<p>about lack of progress, the lack of UK police officers on the ground (due in part he felt </p>
<p>to Chief Constables blocking deployment for security reasons), differences between the </p>
<p>UK and the US approach and the absence of a delegated budget. Mr Rammell stated: </p>
<p>“My view, having listened to him, is that he raises serious concerns which are at </p>
<p>odds with our statements as to how the situation is improving.”</p>
<p><b>520. </b> The Home Office record of the Iraq Senior Officials Group of 4 November recorded </p>
<p>that Mr Straw’s initial reaction to DCC White’s documentary was to call a “special </p>
<p>meeting of Ministers to discuss what more could be done” but FCO officials had advised </p>
<p>that that was not necessary.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p><b>521. </b> An update produced for Mr Straw by the Iraq Security Sector Unit (ISSU) on </p>
<p>5 November acknowledged that “there had been delays in late summer” but said that </p>
<p>these had now been resolved.</p>
<p>461</p>
<p> On the specific issues about which DCC White had </p>
<p>expressed concerned, the ISSU observed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>risk assessments – “ACPO require very strict assurances”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>budget – that was “a matter for CPA South and Baghdad”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the new accelerated programme for training – “this is far from ideal … the risks </p>
<p>that flow from putting large numbers of insufficiently trained police on the streets </p>
<p>are clear”. </p>
<p><b>Security incidents involving UK SSR staff</b></p>
<p>UK personnel involved in SSR were the subject of a number of security incidents between </p>

<p>On 24 June 2003, six members of the RMP</p>

<p> who had been engaged in the </p>
<p>training of local Iraqi police forces were killed at Majarr al Kabir, near Basra (see </p>
<p>Sections 9.2 and 16.3).</p>

<p>170</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 23 August, three members of the RMP were killed</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> and another seriously </p>
<p>injured in an attack in central Basra (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> Up to five Iraqis were </p>
<p>also understood to have been killed or seriously injured.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 19 November, DCC White’s convoy was subject to an Improvised Explosive </p>
<p>Device (IED) attack outside the Basra courthouse.</p>
<p>467</p>
<p> One of his protection </p>
<p>officers was seriously injured. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 22 April 2004, the police training academy at az&#8209;Zubayr was attacked by </p>
<p>suicide bombers.</p>
<p>468</p>
<p> Although no UK police were injured in the attack, it led to a </p>
<p>review of security at the facility. A subsequent Cabinet Office paper described </p>
<p>the site as “isolated and exposed” but said that a more permanent and secure </p>
<p>site would take time to construct, and would cost between £5m and £10m, for </p>
<p>which there was no provision.</p>
<p>469</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The facility at az&#8209;Zubayr remained and in June 2004 Mr Hoon stated: </p>
<p>“The attack on the facility in April had strengthened the determination of the Iraqi </p>
<p>recruits (and their instructors) to deliver an effective police force. An impressive </p>
<p>set up.” </p>

<p>171</p>
<p><b>525. </b> The minutes of the Security Sector Reform Meeting</p>
<p>474</p>
<p> of 4 December recorded that </p>
<p>“not much work had been done in this area” and that “there still did not appear to be a </p>
<p>definitive US policy position”.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>526. </b> On 25 February 2004, minutes of the Security Sector Reform Meeting recorded </p>
<p>that Mr Gareth Davies, Senior Prisons Adviser to CPA(South), was arranging training </p>
<p>for Iraqi Correctional Service officers.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> Canada had also “hinted” that it might support </p>
<p>training. Two prisons in MND(SE) were being “refurbished/rebuilt”. </p>
<p><b>527. </b> Canada’s offer to deliver training was confirmed at the Security Sector Reform </p>
<p>Meeting on 5 April.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p><b>528. </b> For the same meeting, Mr Davies had prepared a paper (dated 29 March) on the </p>
<p>progress of the Prisons Project in CPA(South). He noted that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “clear separation of function” between the police, courts and prisons had </p>
<p>been “more difficult practically than envisaged” but was now “largely complete”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Of the five facilities within the UK’s AOR, one was functioning (al&#8209;Maqil) and </p>
<p>the other four (al&#8209;Minah, Basra Central, al&#8209;Amarah and Nasiriyah) were under </p>
<p>development or construction.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The recruitment and training of managers and staff for the increase in </p>
<p>establishments should not be difficult, but funding “Pay Running Costs” </p>
<p>remained a problem.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On safeguards for the treatment of prisoners there was “little or no National </p>
<p>Correctional Policy emanating from Baghdad”, resulting in “serious” policy gaps, </p>
<p>such as disciplinary codes for both prisoners and staff. </p>
<p><b>529. </b> Mr Davies described al&#8209;Maqil as being “in a very poor state of repair” and “close </p>
<p>to collapse”. Problems with sewage had been exacerbated by severe overcrowding: </p>
<p>in January the prison’s population reached 478 against a capacity of 230. Part of the </p>
<p>reason for that rise had been a “weakness in the due process” where prisoners were </p>
<p>kept on remand without judicial review. A system of referral to judges had helped </p>
<p>alleviate the problem. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Davies submitted a report in April 2004 with recommendations for staffing levels </p>
<p>after 30 June.</p>
<p>478</p>
<p> A joint bid from the FCO and DFID to the Global Conflict Prevention </p>
<p>Pool (GCPP) fund for nine prison officers to be both monitors and advisers was planned. </p>
<p>The Government has been unable to supply a copy of Mr Davies’ report.</p>
<p>474 </p>
<p>The Security Sector Reform Meeting was a regular meeting of policy officers that discussed a range of </p>
<p>SSR matters, including police training, military reform, prisons and the judiciary. It was chaired by the FCO </p>
<p>and attended by the MOD, DFID, the Home Office and (occasionally) HM Customs and Excise. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>531. </b> A funding bid for £5.53m for a project to support the prison service in Southern Iraq </p>
<p>from summer 2004 onwards stated that prisons strategy in MND(SE) was overseen by </p>
<p>the Director of Law and Order, who had been seconded from the UK Prison Service.</p>
<p>479</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was supported by a Senior Prisons Adviser and an administrator. Prison monitoring </p>
<p>was undertaken by three members of the Military Prison Service plus two members of </p>
<p>the Territorial Army who were UK prison officers in their civilian careers. The bid sought </p>
<p>to increase staffing numbers to 15. All other staff working in the Correctional Service </p>
<p>were Iraqi locals.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> The bid stated that there were approximately 800 prisoners in MND(SE). Three </p>
<p>new prisons were in development, with a total capacity of 1,650 places. All prisons within </p>
<p>the CPA(South) boundary run by the Iraqi Prison Service were overseen and maintained </p>
<p>by the UK. </p>
<p><b>533. </b> A letter dated 2 July confirmed that £1.7m had been agreed for that project by the </p>
<p>Iraqi GCPP Strategy Committee.</p>

<p><b>The position in the South leading up to the transfer of sovereignty</b></p>
<p><b>534. </b> A record of the Iraq Senior Officials Group on 12 December 2003 stated that the </p>
<p>MOD intended to deploy an additional infantry battalion to assist ICDC training and more </p>
<p>RMP to assist police training and mentoring.</p>
<p>481</p>
<p> The record stated: “The importance of </p>
<p>close co&#8209;ordination between departments on police initiatives was stressed”. </p>
<p><b>535. </b> On 19 December, Mr Lee wrote to Mr Bowen, stating there had been “some </p>
<p>surprise” expressed at the forthcoming deployment of additional RMP to MND(SE) and </p>
<p>“concern about MOD’s alleged lack of consultation over this deployment”.</p>
<p>482</p>
<p><b>536. </b> Mr Lee wrote:</p>
<p>“For months now the MOD has been assured by the FCO, and MND(SE) has been </p>
<p>assured by the CPA, that civil police were in the pipeline to provide training and </p>
<p>mentoring … All accepted the crucial importance of standing up the IPS as rapidly </p>
<p>as possible and thus the importance of providing proper civil police trainers to train </p>
<p>civil police. HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] and the CPA have not … delivered … </p>
<p>we have repeatedly stressed that we see police training as important and that it is </p>
<p>best delivered by civil police.” </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>537. </b> In his response, Mr Bowen welcomed the deployment but said:</p>
<p>“… I find it odd that when we have discussed police training and the like at meetings </p>
<p>of officials and had been reassured that all is on track, this has not been challenged </p>
<p>at the time. It is not just the MOD who see the importance of police training, so do </p>
<p>we all. We must ensure that the information flow between departments is such that </p>
<p>messages we need to send to Washington or the CPA (or each other) are registered </p>
<p>before we reach crisis point … there is a clear role for senior officials to intervene if </p>
<p>programmes are going off the rails.”</p>
<p>483</p>
<p><b>538. </b> A further MOD force level review at the end of January 2004 considered SSR to be </p>
<p>“on track in MND(SE)”, although it did register problems with resourcing police training </p>
<p>and mentoring.</p>
<p>484</p>
<p><b> </b>It concluded that “given the right conditions” there would be no need </p>
<p>to replace the SSR battalion who were conducting ICDC training in July 2004 and added </p>
<p>that “assuming the security situation continues to stabilise” further reductions in force </p>
<p>levels might be possible by November 2004. Those recommendations were based on </p>
<p>assumptions that “consent of the population” would be “maintained” and that SSR would </p>
<p>continue “to deliver evermore capable and credible ISF”. </p>
<p><b>539. </b> In early 2004, the focus in policing shifted from training to providing officers to act </p>
<p>as monitors/mentors, terms that appear to have been used interchangeably at the time.<b> </b></p>
<p>Given the deteriorating security situation and the need for mentors to be out on the </p>
<p>ground, deploying police officers was problematic.</p>
<p>485</p>
<p><b> </b>As a consequence, that role had </p>
<p>been undertaken by the RMP.</p>
<p><b>540. </b> Following a request from PJHQ to relieve the RMP, the FCO began considering </p>
<p>contracting around 40 UK retired officers.</p>
<p>486</p>
<p> At the same time the US was developing </p>
<p>plans to recruit around 500 police advisers from Dyncorps to act as monitors/mentors, </p>
<p>with 50 being earmarked for the South. The UK’s seemingly unilateral approach was met </p>
<p>with some consternation by Mr Casteel, who reportedly said: “This isn’t two countries, </p>
<p>you know.” </p>
<p><b>541. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald chaired a meeting of the Iraq Strategy Group on </p>
<p>13 February.</p>
<p>487</p>
<p> Mr Dodd’s record of the meeting stated that the recent attacks in Erbil </p>
<p>showed that “terrorists felt threatened” by SSR. The US was focused on building the </p>
<p>ISF’s capacity, “with [General] Abizaid stressing quality over quantity”. While the US </p>
<p>planned to hand over security responsibility to Iraqi forces at a local level in July, US </p>
<p>Commanders “were not entirely confident they would have sufficient Iraqi forces … but </p>
<p>five months remained” to meet that deadline.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>542. </b> On 8 March, Mr Straw gave permission for ISSU to proceed with contracting </p>
<p>40 police monitors/mentors.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> Those officers would work directly to Coalition Forces </p>
<p>but would co&#8209;ordinate closely with CPA(South).</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> It was estimated that the cost for </p>
<p>six months would be around £3&#8209;4m. In a minute from ISSU to Mr Straw, the reason </p>
<p>given for the unilateral approach was that the numbers of international police advisers </p>
<p>had been “slow to build”. There was no mention of the US Dyncorps contract. </p>
<p><b>543. </b> DCC Brand had recommended that some of those officers should be offered to the </p>
<p>CPA as part of a Coalition&#8209;wide effort. However, the assessment from ISSU was that, in </p>
<p>the present security environment, it would be too great a risk to deploy FCO&#8209;contracted </p>
<p>British personnel to police station monitoring outside the UK AOR.</p>
<p><b>544. </b> The minutes of the working level ‘Security Sector Reform Group’ of 22 April </p>
<p>mentioned US plans to deploy Dyncorps contractors to MND(SE) but stated that “it is </p>
<p>still unclear as to the exact deployment dates and numbers”.</p>
<p>490</p>
<p> They also referred to </p>
<p>finalising the role for the UK contractors and efforts to ensure they “complement, not </p>
<p>compete” with the Dyncorps contractors. </p>
<p><b>545. </b> ACC Read told the Inquiry that “it was made quite clear” that the Dyncorps </p>
<p>contractors would not answer to him and that “co&#8209;ordinating these resources and </p>
<p>agreeing a common approach to police reform including the style of policing we wanted </p>
<p>to introduce was going to be an issue”.</p>
<p>491</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>546. </b> The separate UK contract for 40 police monitors/mentors was let to ArmorGroup</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> </p>
<p>for £5m for six months, with the intention of deploying them in early June.</p>
<p>493</p>
<p> However, in </p>
<p>light of a further decline in security and the assessment that the type of monitoring they </p>
<p>would do would be “of little value until the Iraqi police [in MND(SE)] have undergone </p>
<p>more specialist skills training”, the deployment was put on hold by the FCO until </p>
<p>September 2004.</p>
<p><b>547. </b> On 26 April, Mr Rycroft wrote to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary, copying his letter </p>
<p>to DFID, the MOD, the Cabinet Office and UK officials in Iraq and the US (see Section </p>
<p>6.2).</p>
<p>494</p>
<p> He reported that Mr Blair thought improvements to existing activities must be </p>
<p>made, including on:</p>
<p>“(a) Iraqiisation. We must do whatever it takes to get the ICDC and Iraqi police in </p>
<p>shape …”</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>548. </b> On 30 April, the Cabinet Office assessed that in MND(SE) most ICDC battalions </p>
<p>and the police should be able to operate without a full&#8209;time MNF presence by 30 June, </p>
<p>although it conceded that the ISF in MND(SE) had not faced the level of challenge that </p>
<p>many others faced in the April violence.</p>
<p>495</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>549. </b> Similarly, the MOD assessed that following the transfer, “by 1 July, the ISF will </p>
<p>have the lead for security and the MNF will be operating in support of them”.</p>
<p>496</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>MOD assessed the position in Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Basra provinces positively: in </p>
<p>some areas the ISF would “operate without any assistance at all except a standby Quick </p>
<p>Reaction Force”. The MOD plan was to minimise its “overt presence” by, for example, </p>
<p>relocating from Basra Palace (inside the city) to Basra Airport (outside the city). </p>
<p>In Maysan province, the security situation was considered to be more challenging </p>
<p>(as described later in this Section). </p>
<p><b>SSR across Iraq: summer 2004 to summer 2006</b></p>
<p><b>550. </b> On 28 June 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) formally handed over to </p>
<p>a sovereign Iraqi Government, the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG), and Dr Allawi became </p>
<p>the Iraqi Prime Minister. The process of establishing the IIG is described in Section 9.2.</p>
<p><b>551. </b> On 20 June, Prime Minister Designate Allawi set out his military capacity&#8209;building </p>
<p>strategy in a televised press statement.</p>
<p>497</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Dr Allawi’s strategy included a 6,000&#8209;strong intervention force with both police and </p>
<p>army components, the creation of a Special Forces Organisation and continued ING and </p>
<p>army training.</p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>553. </b> Mr Falah Haasan al&#8209;Naqib was appointed as the Minister of Interior and </p>
<p>Mr Hazem Shalan al&#8209;Khuzaei was appointed as the Minister for Defence.</p>
<p>499</p>
<p> Dr Rubaie </p>
<p>continued to serve as the National Security Adviser. Mr Barham Saleh became Deputy </p>
<p>Prime Minister for National Security. </p>
<p><b>554. </b> During the CPA era, the metric used to measure progress with the ISF was the </p>
<p>number of personnel on duty.</p>
<p>500</p>
<p> Immediately after the transition, that metric was replaced </p>
<p>by “trained and equipped” personnel. The net result was a 75 percent drop in recorded </p>
<p>MOI force totals, from 181,297 “on duty” personnel on 15 June 2004, to 47,255 “trained </p>
<p>and equipped” personnel on 25 August 2004.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>555. </b> When the IIG was constituted, the UK and the US ceased to be Occupying Powers </p>
<p>and instead were operating under resolution 1546 (2004) and the annexed letters from </p>
<p>Dr Allawi and Mr Powell (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>501</p>
<p> The points of relevance for SSR were that </p>
<p>the Security Council:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>welcomed ongoing efforts by the incoming IIG to develop the ISF, operating </p>
<p>under the authority of the IIG and its successors, “which will progressively play </p>
<p>a greater role and ultimately assume full responsibility for the maintenance of </p>
<p>security and stability in Iraq”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognised that the MNF would assist in building the capability of the ISF, </p>
<p>through a programme of recruitment, training, equipping, mentoring and </p>
<p>monitoring;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>emphasised the importance of developing effective Iraqi police and border </p>
<p>enforcement, under the control of the MOI, and the FPS, under the MOI and </p>
<p>other ministries, for the maintenance of law, order and security; it requested </p>
<p>Member States and international organisations to assist the IIG in building the </p>
<p>capability of those institutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>attributed a number of roles to the Special Representative to the Secretary </p>
<p>General and the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq including promoting the </p>
<p>protection of human rights, reconciliation and judicial and legal reform;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>welcomed the fact that arrangements were being put in place to establish </p>
<p>a security partnership between the IIG and MNF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted that appropriate Iraqi Ministers were responsible for the ISF, that the IIG </p>
<p>had authority to commit the ISF to the MNF to engage in operations, and that </p>
<p>the security structures planned would serve as fora for the IIG and the MNF </p>
<p>to reach agreement on security and policy issues, and ensure full partnership </p>
<p>between Iraqi security forces and the MNF, through close co&#8209;ordination and </p>
<p>consultation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>called on Member States and international organisations to respond to Iraqi </p>
<p>requests to assist Iraqi efforts to integrate Iraqi veterans and former militia </p>
<p>members into Iraqi society.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Dr Allawi’s letter annexed to the resolution asked for the support of the Security </p>
<p>Council and the international community in providing security and stability until Iraq was </p>
<p>able to provide security for itself. </p>
<p><b>557. </b> Resolution 1546 (2004) expired in November 2005. It was replaced by resolution </p>
<p>1637 (2005),</p>

<p> and subsequently resolutions 1723 (2006)</p>
<p>503</p>
<p> and 1790 (2007).</p>

<p><b>UK, US and Iraqi plans for SSR</b></p>
<p><b>558. </b> On 15 July 2004, the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP) considered </p>
<p>a paper by Mr Straw entitled ‘Iraq: the Next Six Months’.</p>
<p>505</p>
<p> The paper outlined the </p>
<p>desired position for Iraq by January 2005. For the ISF, the objective was:</p>
<p>“Significantly increased Iraqi security capacity and capability with Iraqi forces in local </p>
<p>control around much of the country and a reduced reliance on MNF&#8209;I, paving the </p>
<p>way for foreign troop reductions in 2005.”</p>
<p><b>559. </b> The priority was identified as continued support to Iraqiisation through training, </p>
<p>equipping and mentoring of ISF, with a focus on command and civilian oversight </p>
<p>(particularly of the army and the Iraqi National Intelligence Service). </p>
<p><b>560. </b> The priorities identified in Mr Straw’s paper were agreed by DOP.</p>
<p>506</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>561. </b> On 21 July, the Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR reported that recruitment to the </p>
<p>ISF was “buoyant” and equipment was being delivered.</p>
<p>507</p>
<p> The ISF were: </p>
<p>“… increasingly taking the lead in patrolling and on specific operations. Their </p>
<p>credibility with the Iraqi people seems to be increasing … and local control has been </p>
<p>achieved in some areas, particularly MND(SE).” </p>
<p><b>562. </b> The Annotated Agenda noted that “despite the growth of capacity, significant </p>
<p>capability gaps remain” and both the Joint Headquarters and proposed National Joint </p>
<p>Operations Centre would “require further advice, supervision and equipment before Iraqi </p>
<p>command is satisfactory”. ISF units would “require careful command and control training </p>
<p>and mentoring once formed”. </p>
<p><b>563. </b> An annex to the Annotated Agenda stated that overall numbers were already close </p>
<p>to target (a total of 233,000 ISF personnel against a planned total of “around 260,000” </p>
<p>by January 2005). It stated that the IPS had “already hit its full manning levels”, would </p>
<p>“be 100 percent equipped by end 04”, and with the completion of current training </p>
<p>programmes be “fully operational” by June 2005. </p>
<p><b>564. </b> The IPS was also focused on the need “to slim” the police force “by up to </p>
<p>30,000 men”. The annex stated that “just fewer than 3,000” Iraqi Army personnel had </p>
<p>been trained and the rate of recruitment and training was “set to go up to end 2004”. </p>
<p><b>565. </b> Lt Gen Petraeus carried out a “Troops To Task” assessment in July and August </p>
<p>2004 with General George Casey, who replaced Lt Gen Sanchez as Commander of </p>
<p>the Coalition’s military command in June 2004.</p>

<p>510</p>
<p> Mr Naworynsky reported that it would take until mid&#8209;2006 to achieve </p>
<p>the proposed staffing levels for the ISF and that further (financial) resources would be </p>
<p>needed. The development of the Iraqi police was identified as the “main effort”. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> Mr Naworynsky wrote: </p>
<p>“The report shows that US thinking in this area remains very similar to our own with </p>

<p>179</p>
<p>Iraq’s security structures and policy, diplomatic and international relations, economic </p>
<p>policy and investments in infrastructure”. It had been drafted by an Iraqi and MNF </p>
<p>working group that included UK advisers. Section 9.3 details the political elements of </p>
<p>the Strategy. </p>
<p><b>569. </b> The Strategy was approved with minor amendments. It was agreed that it should </p>
<p>proceed to a Ministerial discussion on 29 July and to Prime Minister Allawi on 5 August. </p>
<p>The intention was that “the Strategy should be published shortly afterwards” but the </p>
<p>timetable might slip given Dr Allawi’s overseas commitments. </p>
<p><b>570. </b> Mr Chaplin wrote that “detailed work” on the chapter regarding national security </p>
<p>institutions was ongoing and, in particular, a “troops to task study” led by MNF had </p>
<p>“concluded that a significant increase in the planned number of conventional police, </p>
<p>Border Police and National Guard is required”. He confirmed that Prime Minister Allawi, </p>
<p>Defence Minister Hazem Shalan al&#8209;Khuzaei and Interior Minister Falah Haasan al&#8209;Naqib </p>
<p>had been told about that but he did not know their reaction. Mr Chaplin understood </p>
<p>that the revised ISF structure, including the additional numbers of troops and police </p>
<p>recommended, would create a US$2.8bn shortfall and that Lt Gen Petraeus had </p>
<p>approached Ambassador John Negroponte (who had replaced Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>as US Ambassador to Iraq) on 25 July to ask that these funds were found. </p>
<p><b>US and Iraqi SSR funding </b></p>
<p>The US funded SSR tasks through two funding streams:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) was the largest source of US </p>
<p>reconstruction funding, comprising US$20.86bn made available through two </p>
<p>appropriations, IRRF1 and IRRF2.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p> US$4.94bn of IRRF2 funds were allocated to </p>
<p>security and law enforcement. In addition to that, US$2.31 billion was allocated to </p>
<p>“justice, public safety infrastructure, and civil society”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF) was created in May 2005 and ran until </p>
<p>June 2009.</p>
<p>513</p>
<p> It made available US$18.04bn to “train, equip, and maintain all </p>
<p>elements of the Iraqi Security Forces, including the Iraqi Army, Navy, Air Force, </p>
<p>Special Operations Forces; Iraqi police forces; special task forces; the Iraqi </p>
<p>Intelligence Agency; and border security forces.” That fund was administered by the </p>
<p>DoD through MNSTC&#8209;I.</p>

<p><b>571. </b> On 29 July, Mr Chaplin wrote to the FCO in London advising that the UK should </p>
<p>resist making substantive changes to the draft Strategy which risked delaying publication </p>
<p>and “unravelling what we have achieved so far”.</p>
<p>518</p>
<p> He explained that the Strategy had </p>
<p>been through “a laborious drafting process” for the past seven weeks and the “latest </p>
<p>version represents a fine balance between the IIG and US/UK representatives”.</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Mr Chaplin explained that some “confusion has crept into the Whitehall debate </p>
<p>about different elements of the overall strategy required to deal with the insurgency”. </p>
<p>Seeking to clarify matters, he wrote that the Strategy was “a conceptual document </p>
<p>describing the Government’s overall approach”. The operational work “falling out” </p>
<p>of it included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MNF&#8209;I strategic campaign plan to develop a self&#8209;reliant ISF by January 2006;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an operational plan to man, train, equip and assist the ISF, currently being </p>
<p>“masterminded by Gen Petraeus”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a baseline “troops to task” reassessment; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work on the new intelligence architecture. </p>
<p><b>573. </b> By early August, Mr Blair was concerned that neither an Iraqi security strategy </p>
<p>nor an MNF internal review of Iraqiisation had yet appeared.</p>
<p>519</p>
<p> The security strategy </p>
<p>was particularly important for demonstrating publicly that the IIG had a plan to deal with </p>
<p>the security situation. The FCO was instructed to press Prime Minister Allawi on the </p>
<p>importance of issuing a public statement soon. </p>
<p><b>574. </b> Mr Dominic Asquith, a Deputy Commissioner in the CPA, reported on 9 August that </p>
<p>Dr Allawi understood the need to explain the IIG strategy on security, “but does not think </p>
<p>the National Security Strategy document fits the bill”.</p>
<p>520</p>
<p> Dr Allawi had, however, agreed </p>
<p>the need to sort out the details quickly with the MNF. </p>
<p><b>575. </b> On 14 August, Mr Asquith reported that the launch of the National Security </p>
<p>Strategy had been the subject of a “confused discussion” at the MCNS on 12 August.</p>
<p>521</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr Allawi had said that the Strategy would need to be revised but it was unclear how </p>
<p>that would be done. </p>
<p><b>576. </b> By the time Mr Blair visited Iraq and met Dr Allawi in Baghdad on 21 December, </p>
<p>a new plan had been drafted.</p>
<p>522</p>
<p> They discussed Iraqiisation. Mr Blair stated that he </p>
<p>had seen a draft of Dr Allawi’s new security plan which he thought was “along the right </p>
<p>lines” and that he had agreed to review the Iraqiisation strategy with President Bush </p>
<p>in January. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Dr Allawi suggested that the Petraeus Plan could be accelerated by more training </p>
<p>for the ISF command structure and more recruitment of untainted figures from the old </p>
<p>army.</p>
<p><b>578. </b> On 23 December, No. 10 reported that Mr Blair was “encouraged that Allawi is now </p>
<p>working on a security strategy which he intends to publish”.</p>
<p>523</p>
<p><b>579. </b> On 3 January 2005, Prime Minister Allawi wrote to Mr Blair, enclosing an updated </p>
<p>draft of the security plan.</p>
<p>524</p>
<p> He had also sent the paper to President Bush that day and </p>
<p>shared the covering letter with Mr Blair. The letter to President Bush highlighted the </p>
<p>mounting security challenges facing Iraq, the lack of resources and the importance of </p>
<p>accelerating the recruitment, training and deployment of Iraqi forces. </p>
<p><b>580. </b> The paper was six pages long and briefly outlined the problems with the ISF and </p>
<p>potential solutions. The solutions included: merging the ING with the Iraqi Army to fill </p>
<p>gaps caused by current depletions; a rapid extension of forces; additional training; </p>
<p>and giving the army responsibility for border security. It stated that a request would be </p>
<p>made to the IMF and World Bank to cover a “$1.9bn (or officially $2.25bn)” shortfall in </p>
<p>year one.</p>
<p><b>581. </b> On 6 January, Mr Martin Howard, MOD Director General Operational Policy, sent </p>
<p>a draft note about the Strategy to Ms Margaret Aldred, Deputy Head OD Sec, Cabinet </p>
<p>Office.</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> Mr Howard wrote that the letter was to go to Mr Nick Beadle, Coalition Senior </p>
<p>Adviser to the IMOD, and Mr Charles Heatly, Adviser to Prime Minister Allawi in Baghdad </p>
<p>and reflected what he and Ms Aldred had agreed the previous day. The note was broadly </p>
<p>supportive of the Strategy but observed that the US could be sensitive to some of the </p>
<p>content, including references to the slow pace of army training (“as a criticism of the </p>
<p>Petraeus Plan”) and to recruiting members of the former Iraqi armed forces. </p>
<p><b>582. </b> The draft note stated that reference to “coalition embedded troops” should be </p>
<p>removed from the Strategy document because it had not yet been endorsed in London </p>
<p>and said “it would be better from Allawi’s perspective to minimise any impression that the </p>
<p>Iraqi security forces will remain over&#8209;dependent on the coalition”. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> The National Security Strategy was eventually issued on 15 January 2005.</p>
<p>526</p>
<p> In it, </p>
<p>Dr Allawi was reported to have amended the goal of training 100,000 Iraqi soldiers by </p>
<p>July to 150,000 “fully qualified” soldiers by the end of the year. </p>

<p><b>Training the Iraqi Army</b></p>
<p>Training of individual army recruits followed one of two patterns:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Recruits with former military experience went into a Direct Recruit Replacement </p>
<p>programme. They received three weeks’ standardised training delivered by the </p>
<p>Major Subordinate Commands at Regional Training Centres.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Recruits without military experience were sent for training at the Iraqi Training </p>
<p>Brigade in Kirkush. All new recruits undertook a five&#8209;week programme followed </p>
<p>by an additional three to seven weeks of specialist skills training.</p>
<p>527</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>five&#8209;week programme was increased to 13 weeks in early 2007.</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>In 2006, a system of six Regional Training Centres was established to develop a  </p>
<p>non&#8209;commissioned officer corps and a year&#8209;long Basic Officers Commissioning Course, </p>
<p>based on a Sandhurst curriculum, was established at three Military Academies.</p>
<p>529</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By early 2007, a National Defence University had been established and was beginning </p>
<p>to run institutions of professional development: Iraqi Staff Colleges, a National Defence </p>
<p>College and a Strategic Studies Institute.</p>
<p>530</p>
<p>In May 2007, the Iraqi Training and Doctrine Command, part of the Joint Headquarters </p>
<p>assumed responsibility from MNSTC&#8209;I for training and equipping the Iraqi military.</p>

<p>Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments) from July 2003 to March 2006, a </p>
<p>paper on the UK’s options for withdrawing or reducing the number of troops in Iraq “up </p>
<p>to and beyond January 2006” (see Section 9.3).</p>
<p>532</p>
<p> He stated that the IPS would have </p>
<p>manned, trained and equipped “77 percent” of the target 135,000 officers by the end of </p>
<p>July 2005 and the ING numbers were also “on course” to be achieved by that date. Lt </p>
<p>Gen McColl wrote that “these encouraging projections have, in part, prompted MNF&#8209;I’s </p>
<p>aspiration to establish Iraqi regional … control across all 18 provinces by 31 July 2005”.</p>
<p><b>585. </b> Lt Gen McColl considered the goal “challenging” because of “significant shortfalls </p>
<p>in logistics capability” of the ISF. He highlighted a lack of trained staff, a “serious rift” </p>
<p>between the MOI and IMOD and “the need for a proper national security headquarters”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>586. </b> On 20 October, Lt Gen McColl sent the Hauldown Report of his tour in Iraq.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“Despite their limited numbers and state of training, ISF are even now capable of </p>
<p>strategically significant impact. Their deployment has an effect that coalition troops </p>
<p>cannot achieve … They are therefore in great demand and, there is a risk … that </p>
<p>their premature committal to operations, which are still beyond their capacity, could </p>
<p>irreparably dent their confidence. The risk is exacerbated by the understandable </p>
<p>impatience of the IIG, supported to some extent in both Washington and London …</p>
<p>“The critical path for the IPS will be meeting the sheer scale of the equipping and </p>
<p>training requirement, as well as the continued identification of tough committed </p>
<p>police chiefs. There are grounds for optimism, but no police force could operate in </p>
<p>the current levels of violence without relying on the support of the Army, including the </p>
<p>ING, to provide a secure framework and surge capability … </p>
<p>“The frustration that the UK has felt at the slow and chequered progress of ISF </p>
<p>generation has been understandable. Our contribution outside MND(SE) has, </p>
<p>however been limited (aside from helpful training team activity) to advice to US </p>
<p>colleagues who are themselves frustrated and doing all they can to translate the </p>
<p>$5 billion they are investing into security capability, whilst reconciling the somewhat </p>
<p>turbulent aspirations of the IIG. Within MND(SE) the flow of equipment to ING and </p>
<p>IPS from US suppliers has been painfully slow, a problem compounded by the </p>
<p>prioritisation of issue based on the prevailing security situation across the country. </p>
<p>There has recently been an initiative, which has yet to deliver effect that would allow </p>
<p>UK resources to support the equipping of the ISF within the UK area; this is to be </p>
<p>welcomed and is perhaps overdue.”</p>
<p><b>587. </b> On putting the right structures in place, Lt Gen McColl referenced the need to put </p>
<p>particular emphasis on developing the MOI “staff planning capability”, which remained </p>
<p>“the most serious concern”.</p>
<p><b>588. </b> On 27 October, a Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessment reported that </p>
<p>the capability of the ISF was “growing” but that their effectiveness remained “patchy”.</p>
<p>534</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It stated:</p>
<p>“The more reliable and better trained elements are in short supply and limit the </p>
<p>current ability of the IIG to conduct more than one or two concurrent operations. </p>
<p>The ISF will improve slowly up to the elections and their capability is planned to </p>
<p>build significantly in the early part of 2005. But we judge that they will not be able </p>
<p>to handle significant security responsibilities unaided until the middle of 2005 at the </p>
<p>earliest. The nascent Iraqi intelligence service (INIS) is also under severe pressure </p>
<p>and continues to suffer from assassinations and penetration.” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>589. </b> A JIC Assessment on 11 November reported that the ISF had been attacked by </p>
<p>insurgent groups “since their creation” and cited “one of the most serious” attacks on </p>
<p>23 October where a convoy of ING forces was ambushed and 49 unarmed recruits were </p>
<p>shot.</p>
<p>535</p>
<p> In describing the risk of infiltration, it stated:</p>
<p>“We judge that all the Iraqi official institutions, including the security forces … employ </p>
<p>individuals who give information to the insurgents, whether willingly or under threat. </p>
<p>We estimate that nearly a third of current police officers will in time have to be </p>
<p>dismissed due to their unsuitability, many of whom are believed to co&#8209;operate with </p>
<p>insurgents. In Basra the police chief has been sacked … Some attacks, such as the </p>
<p>murders of high profile officials, suggest insider knowledge. But insurgents are also </p>
<p>able to intimidate or attack the security forces simply because they live in and are </p>
<p>known among the local community.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>590. </b> On 26 November, MOD officials advised Mr Hoon that the ISF had performed well </p>
<p>during operations in Fallujah (see Section 9.3)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and that the development of the ISF was </p>
<p>“on track”.</p>
<p>536</p>
<p> Many ISF elements were “above the predicted capability” for 1 December. </p>
<p>Although absenteeism remained a problem, it was being addressed, including through </p>
<p>“greater use of posting away from home areas to avoid intimidation”. The minute asked </p>
<p>Mr Hoon to note that:</p>
<p>“ISF tasks during [the Fallujah operation] were deliberately selected so as not to </p>
<p>be too demanding. That most of Fallujah was virtually deserted made ISF follow up </p>
<p>operations easier; and the insurgents made little concerted attempt to disrupt them. </p>
<p>It is not surprising therefore that [the Fallujah operation] did not reveal any significant </p>
<p>gaps in ISF capability, training or equipment. It was never intended so to do.”</p>
<p>FURTHER CONCERNS ABOUT IRAQIISATION</p>
<p><b>591. </b> On 20 August 2004, Mr Phillipson wrote to Mr George Fergusson, OD Sec, </p>
<p>commissioning a paper that set out the full picture in Iraq.</p>
<p>537</p>
<p> It was to cover how Iraq </p>

<p>the IPU suggested that timescales for Iraqiisation could “be compressed … but only </p>

<p>The paper also highlighted that the Petraeus Plan would strain budgets and require </p>
<p>“sustained high level lobbying” of key allies to extend their deployment as many MNF </p>
<p>contributors expected deployment to cease in 2005, earlier than required by the Plan.</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Mr Phillipson, in summarising the paper to Mr Blair, described it as “too vague, and </p>
<p>does not tally with loss of control compared to the situation on the ground in early July, </p>
<p>not least in Basra”.</p>
<p>539</p>
<p> On Iraqiisation, Mr Phillipson suggested:</p>
<p>“The paper says that Iraqiisation is on track. We should ask for a more explicit </p>
<p>assessment. What were the original timelines and benchmarks? What is our </p>
<p>performance against them? How and where can they be tightened up and </p>
<p>accelerated? There is a tendency to fear that this will increase costs – we should </p>
<p>make clear that this should not be a bar to the necessary policy judgements. </p>
<p>On timelines we also need to challenge the assertion that MNF forces will </p>
<p>now need to be in Iraq at present levels until 2006 – we should be looking to </p>
<p>move as quickly as possible to a shift from offensive MNF forces to a smaller </p>
<p>training and advisory deployment.”</p>
<p><b>594. </b> On 29 August, Mr Blair produced a minute in response which expressed that </p>
<p>although the rationale behind Iraqiisation was “fine”, the “urgency of the situation may </p>
<p>overwhelm us and make our timescales … naive”.</p>
<p>540</p>
<p> Mr Blair stressed the need for </p>
<p>immediate action:</p>
<p>“Allawi has to be given, by hook or by crook, immediate strong, well&#8209;armed brigades </p>
<p>who can move into any trouble&#8209;spot and clean up. This has got to take precedence </p>
<p>over the General Petraeus plan. But we cannot have a row over equipment. If he </p>
<p>needs the stuff, he has got to have it.”</p>
<p><b>595. </b> On 9 September, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr David Quarrey, a Private Secretary </p>
<p>in No.10, sent Mr Blair a minute reporting their recent visit to Iraq, for use in Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>planned video conference with President Bush.</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> They reported:</p>
<p>“Iraqiisation is on a trajectory which will take us well into 2005, and maybe into 2006, </p>
<p>before they can stand on their own. The police are doing better than the Army. There </p>
<p>are real capacity issues in the key ministries, though throwing more advisers at them </p>
<p>might not help. We seriously need to make a UK national contribution to speeding up </p>
<p>equipment supply.”</p>
<p><b>596. </b> The minute stated that the US NSC and No.10 would need to “be all over” the </p>
<p>issue in coming months to ensure further progress and the need to maintain pressure for </p>
<p>delivery on Iraqiisation should be one of the key messages for Mr Blair’s conversation </p>
<p>with President Bush. </p>

<p><b>597. </b> On 16 September, Mr Blair chaired a meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on </p>
<p>Iraq (AHMGI – see Section 2), called “to ensure the UK Government approach to Iraq </p>
<p>was fully co&#8209;ordinated in the period up to Iraqi elections in January 2005”.</p>
<p>542</p>
<p> He intended </p>
<p>that the Group should meet regularly. </p>
<p><b>598. </b> Given an insurgency that appeared to be increasingly co&#8209;ordinated, Mr Blair told </p>
<p>the Group that he was “concerned that the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) did not have </p>
<p>sufficient capability to take on the insurgents.” </p>
<p><b>599. </b> Gen Walker reported that plans were in place for the ISF to be fully equipped and </p>
<p>trained by mid&#8209;2005, but that their capabilities would remain limited, especially compared </p>
<p>with the MNF. There was little scope for accelerating the plans. </p>
<p><b>600. </b> The Group agreed that the MOD would “make recommendations on how ISF </p>
<p>capacity will develop and what more we can do to accelerate or refine the delivery to </p>
<p>allow the ISF to tackle the current insurgency campaign”.</p>
<p><b>601. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, visited Iraq from 12 to </p>
<p>15 September.</p>
<p>543</p>
<p> In his report, he observed:</p>
<p>“… the generation of trained and equipped ISF and IPS is taking considerably more </p>
<p>time than expected … Although General Petraeus was buoyant about the progress </p>
<p>in ISF and the recent performance of two of their battalions in Najaf, there is an </p>
<p>underlying reservation highlighted by many, including Gen Casey, that improvement </p>
<p>is slow – the faster release of allocated funds will help.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>602. </b> On 19 September, Mr Blair met Prime Minister Allawi and Iraqi Ministers at </p>
<p>No.10.</p>
<p>544</p>
<p> In Mr Quarrey’s note of the meeting to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary, he wrote </p>
<p>that Dr Allawi had expressed frustration at the pace of Iraqiisation which had followed </p>
<p>“the slow route of General Petraeus” and “had told Bush that he needed security </p>
<p>capacity now, not next year”. </p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Blair said that it was important that the long&#8209;term work continued but that </p>
<p>there was also a need rapidly to increase the capacity of Iraqi intelligence and the ISF. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi requested a meeting with senior defence and intelligence officials </p>
<p>from the US, UK and Iraq “to discuss problems with Iraqiisation”. When Iraqi Ministers </p>
<p>suggested a halt to de&#8209;Ba’athification, Mr Blair and Dr Allawi agreed that the IIG needed </p>
<p>“a practical approach”. </p>
<p><b>604. </b> In a private meeting with Mr Blair afterwards, Dr Allawi said security was his </p>
<p>personal focus, but was part of wider work on an overall strategy addressing national </p>

<p>545</p>
<p> Dr Allawi made clear that tackling the security situation </p>
<p>was his top priority, but he lacked effective resources to achieve that. He “needed: </p>
<p>the two mechanised divisions, a Rapid Deployment Force,</p>
<p>546</p>
<p> an effective anti&#8209;terrorist </p>
<p>capability in the police, and a more rapid build up of intelligence capability”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>commissioned advice from Lt Gen McColl on how best to meet that requirement.</p>
<p><b>605. </b> On 20 September, Mr Naworynsky provided two papers to No.10: “one </p>
<p>on the current status of the ISF, including an analysis of the Petraeus Plan and </p>
<p>recommendations for further work”; and a speaking note for Mr Blair’s next conversation </p>
<p>with President Bush.</p>
<p>547</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>606. </b> The first paper listed the current capability of the ISF as 91,000 recruited and </p>
<p>trained personnel, comprising:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>34,500 police;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>34,200 members of the National Guard; </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>1,900 Army Intervention Force; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>600 Special Forces. </p>
<p><b>607. </b> Those forces were “totally reliant on the Multi&#8209;National Force (MNF) for support” </p>
<p>and “turning quantity into quality – the key to our withdrawal” would “take time”. </p>
<p><b>608. </b> The Petraeus Plan had forecast that by the end of 2005, total ISF strength would </p>
<p>be 234,000 and it would be “able to tackle the majority of threats currently present </p>
<p>in Iraq”. The paper noted that that was ambitious but would in time deliver security </p>
<p>forces to meet Iraq’s predicted needs. It could be accelerated to deliver more forces </p>
<p>with counter&#8209;insurgency capability sooner, but only by taking resources from long&#8209;term </p>
<p>development, and so ultimately extending the length of the programme and the presence </p>
<p>of UK forces in Iraq. The paper stated: “This would not be desirable.”</p>
<p><b>609. </b> The paper stated that the UK could complement the Petraeus Plan by: continuing </p>
<p>to support the MOI and IMOD; procuring equipment for the ISF in MND(SE); continuing </p>
<p>training and mentoring the ISF; supporting NATO training of the middle and senior ranks </p>

<p><b>611. </b> On 21 September, Maj Gen Houghton produced a paper for the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on “the prospects for developing capable and effective Iraqi Security Forces”.</p>
<p>549</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>described the development of the ISF as “not pretty”. The reasons given for that included </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification, the decision to disband the Iraqi armed forces and the absence of a </p>
<p>strategy for Iraq’s security sector architecture. The last had now largely been addressed </p>
<p>by the National Security Strategy, although it was not “officially signed off”. </p>
<p><b>612. </b> Maj Gen Houghton wrote that there had been “an understandable tendency by </p>
<p>some to ‘talk&#8209;up’ the timescales” for delivering manpower, equipment and training. </p>
<p>Progress had been made but “must be set in the context of significant political frustration </p>
<p>at the highest levels of Iraq, US and UK government”. He offered that one conclusion </p>
<p>was that:</p>
<p>“… the current political frustration at the lack of progress in ISF development may </p>
<p>be mis&#8209;directed. It is focusing too much on short&#8209;term, physical and – to an extent – </p>
<p>symbolic representations of capability; it is not focusing enough on the capabilities </p>
<p>which will actually allow Iraq to fight its own campaign. The need to meet this latter </p>
<p>requirement may be brought closer in time as a result of the elections in the new year.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>613. </b> On 22 September, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair with advice on how the ISF would </p>
<p>develop.</p>
<p>550</p>
<p> He stated: </p>
<p>“It is clear that Allawi feels frustrated with progress on Iraqiisation … Our current </p>
<p>assessment is that the Petraeus Plan will deliver ISF scaled to meet Iraq’s needs, </p>
<p>including a limited offensive capability in time for the elections in January 2005. </p>
<p>Allawi’s concerns are undoubtedly genuine.” </p>
<p><b>614. </b> No.10 “pressed MOD for a full and imaginative response to Allawi’s request”.</p>

<p><b>615. </b> Mr Naworynsky addressed that request in a letter to Mr Quarrey on 30 September </p>
<p>after receiving advice from Lt Gen Fry.</p>
<p>553</p>
<p> While the MOD accepted that the pace of </p>
<p>progress “could have been more rapid”, its judgement was:</p>
<p>“… that the Petraeus plan will deliver the required capability and does not need a </p>
<p>radical overhaul. Indeed, to do so would stall momentum and delay the progress </p>
<p>which Allawi desires. Indeed, we run the risk of a ‘new plan’ causing confusion with </p>

<p><b>616. </b> Despite that judgement, Lt Gen Fry had identified that the ING could be provided </p>
<p>with more firepower, mobility and logistic support. To do that, Mr Naworynsky listed six </p>
<p>proposals at an estimated total cost of US$107m. He wrote that those proposals would </p>
<p>“accelerate the development of capable ISF” but were “costly and unfunded” with no </p>
<p>provision for meeting them within the MOD’s budget. He concluded by pointing out that </p>
<p>“even if all this is done, the impact on Iraqi capability for high end counter&#8209;insurgency </p>
<p>operations before elections will remain very limited”. It would, however, “give a highly </p>
<p>visible Iraqi face to such operations which would be at least as important in perception </p>
<p>terms as the military effect achieved”. </p>
<p><b>617. </b> Mr Quarrey summarised the MOD’s proposals to Mr Blair as “effectively brush[ing] </p>
<p>aside Allawi’s demands”.</p>
<p>554</p>
<p> He accepted that there was logic in the proposals but the </p>
<p>focus on ING instead of the main counter&#8209;insurgency forces would not deliver what </p>
<p>Allawi “really wants”. He advised Mr Blair to speak to Mr Hoon, “emphasising the need </p>
<p>for him to take a personal interest in the issue”.</p>

<p><b>Global Conflict Prevention Pool strategy update</b></p>
<p>On 29 September 2004, Mr Stuart Jack, FCO Director Iraq, provided an update on </p>
<p>a revised Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) Strategy to Mr Straw’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary.</p>
<p>561</p>
<p> The Strategy had three objectives: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capacity of the Iraqi Government and civil society to carry out </p>
<p>conflict prevention and resolution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preventing further polarisation and reducing underlying tensions between </p>
<p>different elements of Iraqi society; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capacity of the security sector, with special emphasis on the police </p>
<p>and prisons. </p>
<p>On funding, Mr Jack wrote that Mr Blair had asked the GCPP to fund up to £2m for </p>
<p>a project supporting the MOI. That was in addition to a £2.5m MOD bid approved by </p>
<p>AHMGI on 16 September to purchase equipment for the ISF.</p>
<p>562</p>
<p> Both projects were </p>
<p>considered to serve “our broader Iraq objectives”, although the ISF project only “just </p>
<p>about” met published eligibility criteria for the supply of military equipment.</p>
<p>Mr Straw wrote to Mr Hoon and Mr Benn on 4 October with the revised Strategy, </p>
<p>recommending that the FCO, the MOD and DFID endorse it.</p>
<p>563</p>
<p> Mr Straw flagged that </p>
<p>funding was “over&#8209;committed” that financial year and warned that future project proposals </p>
<p>for Iraq would need to be carefully considered in that light.</p>
<p>There is no record that Mr Benn or Mr Hoon formally endorsed the Strategy. </p>
<p><b>Suggestions for improvements in SSR</b></p>
<p><b>623. </b> Mr Robert Davies, Chief Police Adviser to the MOI, produced a briefing on the IPS </p>
<p>for Mr Straw on 6 October.</p>
<p>564</p>
<p> He wrote: </p>
<p>“The impatient focus on increasing its size (aspiration force of 130K – there are 130K </p>
<p>on current payroll but only 90K accounted for!) has led to a large number of police </p>
<p>joining the service as a result of General Petraeus’ drive for ‘30K in 30 days’, who </p>
<p>have not received any training and who are of questionable integrity and quality.”</p>
<p><b>624. </b> Mr Davies summarised the IPS as “… brave but subject to intimidation, in part </p>
<p>poorly led, weak in structures according to western standards, and in need of further </p>
<p>equipment”.</p>
<p><b>625. </b> Mr Davies also noted that there was no forensic examination of serious crime, </p>
<p>intelligence gathering was weak and “the inability of the IPS to plan operations is </p>
<p>causing all sorts of serious problems in combined operations”. </p>

<p>said: “The poor quality of leadership is being buttressed by Generals with a military </p>
<p>background being transferred to the police.”</p>
<p><b>627. </b> Mr Davies suggested that the UK could offer further assistance through:</p>

<p>• </p>

<p><b>NATO training mission – Iraq</b></p>
<p>On 22 June 2004, NATO received a request from Dr Allawi seeking support to Iraq through </p>
<p>“training and other forms of technical assistance”.</p>
<p>568</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the same day, in a video conference with President Bush, Mr Blair suggested using </p>
<p>the NATO conference in Istanbul, scheduled for later in the month, to secure agreement </p>
<p>to Dr Allawi’s request for NATO help with training.</p>
<p>569</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The matter was discussed at the Istanbul conference on 28 June and all Heads of State </p>
<p>and Government in attendance agreed to offer assistance to the IIG with the training of its </p>
<p>security forces.</p>
<p>570</p>
<p> A training mission was deployed in August to conduct training of Iraqi </p>
<p>Headquarters personnel.</p>
<p>NATO’s previous role had been limited to logistical support of the multinational division led </p>
<p>by the Poles in MND(CS).</p>
<p>571</p>
<p> Personnel from Canada, Hungary, Norway, the Netherlands </p>
<p>and Italy were all involved. </p>
<p>On 8 October, the North Atlantic Council agreed a Concept of Operations for enhancing </p>
<p>NATO’s assistance to the IIG by taking a role in training of the security forces.</p>
<p>572</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lt Gen Petraeus was given the additional role of the head of the NATO training mission.</p>
<p>On 21 February 2005, Mr Hoon was briefed that NATO was encountering problems fully </p>
<p>manning its training mission in Iraq, with a shortfall of 25 posts (around a quarter of the </p>
<p>total). At that stage, the UK had 11 personnel working in the NATO training mission.</p>
<p>573</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To address pressure from NATO for a greater UK role Mr Hoon agreed that the UK </p>
<p>could rebadge 11 personnel from MNSTC&#8209;I involved in Basic Officer Training as NATO </p>
<p>personnel. Mr Hoon agreed with advice from officials that the UK should resist requests </p>
<p>to take the lead on the Junior Officer Leadership Training Module.</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>On 2 June 2005, Mr Roger Cornish, MOD Deputy Director Iraq, recommended the UK </p>
<p>take leadership of the Basic Officer training module when it transferred to NATO.</p>
<p>575</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>did not take effect until 1 July 2006, and then only after agreeing a Memorandum of </p>
<p>Understanding that stipulated the UK would not be expected to make up any personnel </p>
<p>or funding shortfalls.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>By July 2007, the UK contribution to the NATO training mission had reduced to </p>
<p>18 personnel, and was expected to decrease further to 14.</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>The UK provided personnel to the NATO training mission until its withdrawal from Iraq on </p>
<p>31 December 2011.</p>
<p>578</p>
<p> The mission’s mandate was not extended, as agreement could not </p>
<p>be reached on the legal status of NATO troops operating in country. Over the seven&#8209;year </p>
<p>period, the mission trained over 5,000 military personnel and over 10,000 police personnel </p>
<p>at a cost of over €17.5m. </p>
<p><b>632. </b> On 18 August 2004, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blunkett about the importance of </p>
<p>offering training and mentoring to the IPS.</p>
<p>579</p>
<p> He wrote that the MOI lacked “the ability </p>
<p>to conduct even rudimentary operational planning” which restricted both “their ability to </p>
<p>plan and execute police operations” and “the ability of the Iraqi police to assume greater </p>
<p>responsibility from the Multi&#8209;National Force in Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>633. </b> The MOD planned to run a training course “in September/October for some  </p>
<p>50&#8209;60</p>
<p> </p>
<p>senior Iraqi police officers”. Nine UK military personnel would be deployed to </p>
<p>work</p>
<p> </p>
<p>with UK police officers in Iraq “to ensure that a coherent approach is maintained”.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the MOD’s experience suggested “that the benefits of such </p>
<p>training initiatives will fade quickly unless they are followed up with longer&#8209;term support </p>
<p>and underpinned by mentoring”. He had asked officials in the MOD to continue working </p>
<p>with officials from the Home Office and the FCO to consider who should provide this </p>
<p>support and how. </p>
<p><b>635. </b> On 13 September, Mr Chaplin sought the FCO’s views about a “high priority” </p>
<p>programme of assistance to the MOI.</p>
<p>580</p>
<p> He described the MOI as:</p>
<p>“… highly dysfunctional … and in need of significant assistance in a range of areas, </p>
<p>from operational planning to the basics like recording minutes of meetings and </p>
<p>following up action points.”</p>
<p><b>636. </b> Mr Chaplin reported that, while the UK and US had resources allocated to </p>
<p>operational advice and supporting the IPS’s development, nothing “adequately </p>
<p>addresses the need for capacity&#8209;building” within the MOI. A meeting with the MOD, DFID </p>
<p>and UK Police Advisers had concluded that a programme of assistance was needed to </p>
<p>address this gap, and that the GCPP “would be the most appropriate source” of funding. </p>
<p>The key elements of the programme were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>operational planning;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>basic capacity&#8209;building – “getting effective structures and working practices </p>

<p><b>637. </b> In mid&#8209;October, the UK agreed to provide funds from the GCPP to build the </p>
<p>capacity of the MOI, which was described as “a weak link in efforts to make the Iraqi </p>
<p>police effective enough to operate without MNF support”.</p>
<p>581</p>
<p><b>638. </b> At the SSR meeting on 7 October, it was reported that £3.5m of GCPP funding had </p>
<p>been agreed for the MOI project over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>582</p>
<p> The first phase would </p>
<p>be a scoping visit. The second phase would include two advisers until January 2005 and </p>
<p>then four advisers for a further year. There was potential to use civil servants from the </p>

<p><b>639. </b> On 19 October, a group comprising Defence Advisory Team (DAT) personnel </p>
<p>and a consultant were deployed to Iraq to do the initial scoping for the MOI project.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>It reported that the MOI was “unable to carry out basic management functions”.</p>
<p>584</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Basic management information, including the number of police, remained unavailable. </p>
<p>Decision&#8209;making at the top of the Ministry was improving, helped significantly by US </p>
<p>mentors, but it was very difficult to translate decisions into action: </p>
<p>“Iraqi politicians currently find it hard to work with their official colleagues and </p>
<p>deputies, who have often been selected to achieve balance as part of a political </p>
<p>settlement rather than on merit or because they share a political programme. In an </p>
<p>unstable political and security environment, politicians are understandably reluctant </p>
<p>to trust people whom they do not know, and prefer to work with trustworthy family </p>
<p>and tribal members, regardless of formal structures or job titles.”</p>
<p><b>640. </b> The DAT also reported that the MOI was located outside the Green Zone</p>
<p>585</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>that visits were currently limited to three two&#8209;hour slots per week. </p>
<p><b>641. </b> The team recommended that UK support should focus on strengthening the </p>
<p>capabilities of a small, permanent cadre of Iraqi officials who could provide a policy </p>
<p>implementation capacity to any Minister within any overall structure. They also reported </p>
<p>that in the absence of an agreed constitution they could not make recommendations to </p>

<p>The meeting heard that that could delay the project until early April, but that it could </p>
<p>“prove beneficial, as the project will require the new Minister’s backing if it is to </p>
<p>be effective”.</p>
<p><b>648. </b> At the next Iraq GCPP Strategy Meeting on 16 March, the meeting was told that </p>

<p><b>649. </b> In his May 2005 review of policing priorities and resources, Acting Deputy Chief </p>

<p>International Director, that there were financial implications to the request, as the </p>

<p>“accompanied by clear statements of need for more”. Reform of the Iraqi Bar Association </p>
<p>would continue to be “complex and difficult due to the factional and political in&#8209;fighting”; it </p>
<p>was seen as a “long&#8209;term project”. </p>

<p>basic requirements of a fair trial (civil and criminal). She also recommended establishing </p>

<p>professionals” and was listed as a risk to delivery against all programme outputs. ILAC </p>
<p>warned that costs would be £182,000 higher than their grant proposal because the </p>
<p>assumption had been that in 2005 training would be delivered inside Iraq; the security </p>
<p>situation dictated that training would have to continue outside. </p>
<p><b>660. </b> ILAC reported “no substantial progress” with regard to strengthening the </p>
<p>admission requirements or disciplinary procedures of the Iraqi Bar Association (IBA). It </p>
<p>wrote that “politicking” by the IBA leadership would continue to be a risk to the selection </p>
<p>of delegation members. ILAC plans for 2005 included “ways of ameliorating this”. The </p>
<p>Judicial Training Institute remained closed with “no immediate plans to reopen”. It was </p>
<p>“disappointing” that it had “not been possible to engage that important institution”.</p>
<p><b>661. </b> A draft version of a Strategic Conflict Assessment (SCA) dated 27 December 2004 </p>
<p>was circulated amongst officials on 2 March 2005 (it is described in more detail later in </p>

<p>603</p>
<p> The report recommended “the continuation of training of judiciary and </p>

<p><b>664. </b> The update also included the “latest version” of a paper on handling Iraq in 2005 </p>
<p>sent by Ms Kara Owen, Private Secretary to Mr Straw, to Mr Quarrey on 9 December. </p>
<p>Mr Quarrey wrote that Mr Blair had seen earlier versions of the paper and that it was </p>
<p>“mostly fine, but it remains very much work in progress and will need to be revisited </p>
<p>depending on progress with elections and Iraqiisation”.</p>
<p><b>665. </b> The FCO paper, described as an agenda for discussion with the US, considered </p>
<p>that continued progress on Iraqiisation would allow MNF to change during 2005 from </p>
<p>primary responsibility for security in all areas to a supportive role, either in support of </p>
<p>ISF operationally or as trainers or mentors.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p> A transfer of security lead to the ISF could </p>
<p>occur in summer 2005.</p>
<p><b>666. </b> In a note dated 12 December to his No.10 staff, Mr Blair commented that the </p>
<p>situation in Iraq was “worrying”.</p>
<p>607</p>
<p> He gave six reasons for that assessment (see </p>
<p>Section 9.3), one of which was that the Petraeus Plan did “not seem to be yielding the </p>
<p>looked&#8209;for progress”. His note called for a “proper strategy based on a hard&#8209;headed </p>
<p>reality check”; the FCO paper was deemed “inadequate”.</p>
<p><b>667. </b> In a discussion with President Bush on 14 December, Mr Blair said that training </p>
<p>issues needed careful consideration but he was not clear whether the problem was the </p>
<p>strategy, or simply that it needed time.</p>
<p>608</p>
<p> He wondered “were we missing something that </p>
<p>was holding back the reconstruction and Iraqiisation programmes?” </p>
<p><b>668. </b> A JIC Assessment produced on 15 December considering the ISF found: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On<b> </b>force levels; that ISF figures did “not provide a guide to real capability and </p>
<p>quality”, an example being that only “some 50 percent” of the 87,000 police “on </p>
<p>duty” were classified as trained and equipped.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On<b> </b>effectiveness; that while “some progress” had been made among elements </p>
<p>of the ISF, the overall performance of the ISF continued to be “inadequate”. </p>
<p>There was a lack of “equipment, training, leadership, command and control, and, </p>
<p>in many cases, determination to oppose insurgents, particularly when they feel </p>
<p>vulnerable with little or no MNF support close by”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On the environment; that the ISF had been “under sustained attack” and was </p>
<p>“being undermined by increasing penetration and intimidation by insurgents”. </p>
<p>Over 300 ISF members had been killed since August.</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>669. </b> The JIC described the plan to address those issues:</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Allawi wants more capable Iraqi forces to take on the hard&#8209;line </p>
<p>elements of the insurgency and reduce his reliance on the MNF. More army units </p>
<p>are coming on line: elements of a mechanised brigade (including some tanks and </p>
<p>armoured personnel carriers) and two new army brigades are deploying this month, </p>
<p>one to Mosul and one to Baghdad. Three more police special commando battalions </p>
<p>are planned. But these units have limited operational capability (the new brigade </p>
<p>in Mosul is doing badly and is being replaced). This will restrict their employability </p>
<p>in the short term and may jeopardise longer&#8209;term ISF aspirations. A plan has been </p>
<p>put forward to address some of the command and control problems: by the end of </p>
<p>January 2005 a national command and control system will be in place linking the </p>
<p>Prime Minister, MOD and MOI to the national Joint Co&#8209;ordination Centre (JCC) </p>
<p>and provincial JCCs. This will help, but better political leadership and overall </p>
<p>management by the MOI and MOD is required.”</p>
<p><b>670. </b> On prospects, JIC stated:</p>
<p>“Through 2005 ISF capability will grow incrementally and significant units, up to </p>
<p>brigade size should be deployable by the summer. The ISF should benefit from </p>
<p>the planned improved training and equipment procurement programmes. After </p>
<p>significant delays these are now reported to be on track, however the planned </p>
<p>expansion of trained and equipped police from some 47,000 to 135,000 and the </p>
<p>army from some 3,000 to 27,000 between now and July 2005 seems very ambitious. </p>
<p>The more modest increases planned for specialist units may be more achievable. </p>
<p>The NATO mission to assist leadership training is stalled. The ISF will remain </p>
<p>reliant on support from the MNF in many areas, in particular heavy fire support and </p>
<p>logistics. There is little sign of the development of a coherent intelligence capability, </p>
<p>which is critical to success. Leadership and discipline will remain chronic problems </p>
<p>affecting capability; … Attacks and intimidation will also continue to undermine </p>
<p>effectiveness. Policing crime will have to remain a second priority in many areas. </p>
<p>“According to the MNF, 15 out of 18 provinces will be under local control – requiring </p>
<p>only limited support by the MNF – by the end of the year. But we judge local control, </p>
<p>even in some Shia and Kurdish areas, will remain fragile. We assessed in October </p>
<p>that the ISF would not be able to handle significant security responsibilities unaided </p>
<p>until the middle of 2005 at the earliest. We have also previously judged that the </p>
<p>MNF are constraining, not containing, the insurgency. We now judge that, if the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government and the MNF are unable to improve the security situation significantly, </p>
<p>particularly in and around Baghdad, a credible ISF capable of managing the </p>
<p>insurgency unaided will not emerge until 2006 at the earliest.” </p>
<p><b>671. </b> The JIC advised that plans for Iraqi military forces had grown from three infantry </p>
<p>divisions to two infantry divisions, six ING divisions, an Iraqi Intervention Force division </p>
<p>and a mechanised brigade. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>672. </b> The JIC Assessment was discussed at the AHMGI on 16 December, where the </p>
<p>consequences of slow ISF development on MNF drawdown were reiterated.</p>
<p>610</p>
<p> Ministers </p>
<p>agreed that a number of papers should be prepared, including practical suggestions to </p>
<p>adjust the Petraeus Plan, ways of improving the IMOD and MOI, a list of security and </p>
<p>funding issues for Mr Blair to raise with President Bush and a list of useful activities that </p>
<p>other countries could be asked to undertake.</p>
<p><b>673. </b> In a Note to President Bush on 10 January 2005, Mr Blair described the Iraqiisation </p>
<p>of security forces as critical but said that he was not convinced that the plan to deliver </p>
<p>it was robust enough.</p>
<p>611</p>
<p> He identified work on ISF leadership – both Ministerial and </p>
<p>operational – as necessary as well as the provision of “the equipment they need to be </p>
<p>a match for the insurgents”. Mr Blair suggested that the objective should be “more and </p>
<p>tougher quality, while building quantity” and confirmed that he had authorised “an extra </p>
<p>$78m from our MOD for the Iraqi Forces in the South”. Although he could not be sure </p>
<p>that funding was essential, Mr Blair wrote “I’ll take the risk rather than find six months </p>
<p>later it was”.</p>
<p><b>674. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by video conference the following day, he </p>
<p>suggested that the “Luck Review” (described later in this Section) would “give us a better </p>
<p>idea of what was required on Iraqiisation”.</p>
<p>612</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>675. </b> On 16 January, Mr Phillipson sent a note to Mr Geoffrey Adams, Mr Straw’s </p>

<p>613</p>
<p> When he met Dr Rice, Mr Sheinwald raised the “gloomy assessment” that </p>
<p>“only a few thousand of Iraqi Security Forces personnel were properly trained and led”. </p>
<p><b>676. </b> Mr Sheinwald said: “This showed the scale of the problem, as the official numbers </p>
<p>for those trained and equipped was 120,000.” Dr Rice was recorded as saying that “the </p>
<p>problem with the police was simple. They were trained to walk a beat but were now </p>
<p>facing terrorists with RPGs [Rocket Propelled Grenades]. They were either fleeing or </p>
<p>dying, but not fighting.”</p>
<p><b>677. </b> On 21 January, Mr Phillipson wrote to Mr Chris Baker, Principal Private Secretary </p>

<p>614</p>
<p> Gen Walker, Ms Aldred, Mr Phillipson and Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s </p>

<p>203</p>
<p><b>Allegations of abuse by Iraqi police</b></p>
<p>On 25 January 2005, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report which alleged that </p>
<p>the abuse of detainees by Iraqi police and intelligence forces had become “routine and </p>
<p>commonplace”.</p>
<p>615</p>
<p> The report was based on interviews with 90 detainees in Iraq between </p>
<p>July and October 2004 and described “serious and widespread human rights violations”. It </p>
<p>alleged “the systematic use of arbitrary arrest, prolonged pre&#8209;trial detention without judicial </p>
<p>review, torture and ill&#8209;treatment of detainees, denial of access by families and lawyers to </p>
<p>detainees, improper treatment of detained children, and abysmal conditions in pre&#8209;trial </p>
<p>detention facilities”. </p>
<p>The report made a number of recommendations to MNF governments, including the </p>
<p>immediate prioritisation of an investigation into allegations of torture or ill&#8209;treatment of </p>
<p>detainees by the IPS, establishing new mechanisms to investigate allegations of abuse </p>
<p>and an increase in the number of advisers deployed in detention facilities. </p>
<p>The press release issued by HRW on the same day stated:</p>
<p>“International police advisers, primarily US citizens funded through the United States </p>
<p>government, have turned a blind eye to these rampant abuses.”</p>
<p>616</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A note highlighting the publication of the report was sent from a junior official in IPU </p>
<p>to the Private Secretary of Mr Bill Rammell, FCO Parliamentary Under&#8209;Secretary, on </p>
<p>24 January.</p>
<p>617</p>
<p> It stated that the report had been expected for “some time” and that </p>
<p>“Ministers were aware it was pending”. The junior official wrote:</p>
<p>“A preliminary reading would suggest that it is well&#8209;researched, although it appears </p>
<p>to be biased towards conditions in central Iraq with relatively limited coverage of </p>
<p>southern Iraq where the UK has a more direct influence on conditions.”</p>
<p>The junior official outlined the support provided to the Iraqi police and prison services, and </p>
<p>the procedures in place to ensure compliance with international law. The official wrote: </p>
<p>“We will have to review our assistance in the light of this report.”</p>
<p>The Inquiry has seen no reporting of this review in contemporaneous documents.</p>
<p>A telegram from Baghdad on 6 February stated that Mr Andrew Hood, Legal Adviser, </p>
<p>had met Mr Bakhtiar Amin, Iraqi Minister of Human Rights, on 3 February to establish </p>
<p>Mr Amin’s response to the HRW report.</p>
<p>618</p>
<p> Mr Amin was “critical of HRW for issuing </p>
<p>a report without bothering to check with him what corrective action was in hand”. He </p>
<p>explained his Ministry’s team of prison inspectors had already raised the concerns </p>
<p>highlighted in the report to the MOI and those responsible for individual facilities. He did, </p>
<p>however, recognise that work was ad hoc and needed to be better established.</p>

<p>204</p>
<p>Mr Amin thanked the UK for its continued support of his Ministry, especially the training for </p>
<p>prison inspectors in Basra, and asked Mr Hood to investigate whether additional funding </p>
<p>might be available to extend the training to all inspectors.</p>
<p>The telegram reported that security concerns had prevented the International Committee </p>
<p>of the Red Cross (ICRC) carrying out “all but a few” inspections of detention facilities and </p>
<p>the Minister of Justice was reticent to appoint an independent prison ombudsman. That </p>
<p>meant there was “an even greater need” to support the training of Iraqi officials to carry </p>
<p>out inspections. </p>
<p><b>The “Luck Review” and strategy for 2005</b></p>
<p><b>678. </b> A telegram from Mr Chaplin on 21 January 2005 reported that the retired US </p>
<p>General Gary Luck had left Iraq on 20 January after a week&#8209;long assessment of the </p>
<p>ISF’s development.</p>
<p>619</p>
<p> Gen Luck had been appointed by Secretary Rumsfeld to head a </p>
<p>20&#8209;strong team “asked to validate” the Petraeus Plan and “examine whether anything </p>
<p>could be done to speed up the delivery of capable Iraqi forces”. </p>
<p><b>679. </b> Gen Luck would not be producing a written report but would brief </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld and the President on his findings. Mr Chaplin understood that </p>
<p>Gen Luck would “broadly endorse the emerging MNF&#8209;I plan for ISF development” and:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>suggest departments other than Defense play a bigger role;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“rubber&#8209;stamp the MNF&#8209;I’s intention to switch its main effort from operations to </p>
<p>training and mentoring” since that had worked well in MND(SE);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recommend additional advisers in the Ministries to coach and mentor Iraqis; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recommend a fundamental overhaul of intelligence structures.</p>
<p><b>680. </b> Mr Chaplin also referred to the Police Advisory Teams (PATs) concept, whereby a </p>
<p>small number of MNF&#8209;I soldiers and police advisers would be placed in IPS stations. He </p>
<p>wrote that there were different views on its viability. Iraqi advice was that this would “be </p>
<p>a backward step politically”, be resented by the IPS and “raise serious force protection </p>
<p>issues” for those involved. Gen Luck had indicated that he did not intend to reflect any of </p>
<p>those concerns to Secretary Rumsfeld, “presumably because [Gen] Casey was dead set </p>
<p>on PATs, which he sold heavily in Washington”. Mr Chaplin thought that PATs had “now </p>
<p>got so much momentum that it will go ahead in some format” but that the UK “should </p>
<p>influence the eventual shape it takes by encouraging MNF&#8209;I to engage seriously with the </p>
<p>Iraqi concerns”.</p>
<p><b>681. </b> Mr Chaplin wrote that Gen Luck was “particularly impressed” by the UK’s policing </p>
<p>work in the South and that he was “seriously thinking of recommending that the UK </p>
<p>should take the lead for all police work in Iraq”. Mr Chaplin thought that “this would </p>
<p>probably be a step too far for us, and possibly for the Americans as well”, but that the </p>

<p>UK should consider how to use that opportunity to influence the strategic direction of </p>
<p>policing in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>682. </b> Mr Chaplin also reported that the importance of human rights had been raised with </p>
<p>Gen Luck: “These were not nice to have add&#8209;ons but were fundamental to our chances </p>
<p>of defeating the insurgency and sustaining democracy in Iraq.” Mr Chaplin said that </p>
<p>Gen Luck “agreed entirely” but “did not say whether he intended to flag this up”.</p>
<p><b>683. </b> On 23 January 2005, DCC Smith wrote a report about his role in the “Luck </p>
<p>Review”.</p>
<p>620</p>
<p> DCC Smith wrote that the review’s “key recommendation” would be PATs, </p>
<p>and to embed these “to a far greater degree than current International Police Advisors </p>
<p>(IPAs)”. He noted that the concept was not “universally supported” and cited concerns </p>
<p>raised by US advisers, existing IPAs and the Minister of the Interior. DCC Smith did </p>
<p>suggest that PATs could address other police issues such as leadership training and the </p>
<p>“post initial training, quality and morale issues”. DCC Smith later became the UK Chief </p>
<p>Police Adviser in Iraq (in May 2005), a role that combined the two previous Senior Police </p>
<p>Adviser positions in Baghdad and Basra. His reports feature extensively in this Section.</p>
<p><b>684. </b> During a video conference on 17 January, Mr Blair told President Bush that they </p>
<p>had to give a sense that Iraqiisation was “going somewhere” and that things would </p>
<p>change after the elections.</p>
<p>621</p>
<p> He suggested that the Luck Review should feed quickly </p>
<p>into a new, public, security plan. In Mr Blair’s view the weakness of Iraqi structures </p>
<p>remained “a real problem”.</p>
<p><b>685. </b> Ms Aldred and her team in the Cabinet Office co&#8209;ordinated a strategy paper for the </p>

<p>Iraq (see Section 9.3).</p>
<p>622</p>
<p> The draft ‘Iraq: Strategy for 2005’, sent to Mr Quarrey on </p>
<p>8 February, summarised General Luck’s key recommendations:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve ISF capacity to conduct independent counter&#8209;insurgency operations as </p>
<p>well as to maintain domestic order;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish partnerships between Iraqi and coalition units and develop military, </p>
<p>special police, border force, and PATs from the coalition and embed them within </p>
<p>Iraqi forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>build the institutional capabilities of the Government (MOD and MOI) to plan and </p>
<p>direct counter&#8209;insurgency operations; and</p>

<p>206</p>
<p><b>686. </b> One of the key elements of the “Strategy for 2005” was “building up the capability </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Security Forces”. It predicted that the incoming Iraqi Transitional Government </p>
<p>(ITG) would regard security as a top priority and that they should be “encouraged to </p>
<p>build on Allawi’s new security plan” of which key elements were likely to include:</p>

<p>207</p>
<p><b>690. </b> A revised version of the Strategy was shared with the US on 11 February.</p>
<p>624</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That version had removed references to the current security situation and to Military </p>
<p>Assistance Teams (MATs) and Police Advisory Teams (PATs). However, on training the </p>
<p>ISF, it did state the need to embed “military teams to mentor Iraqi forces in operational </p>
<p>roles”. Also added was the need to introduce a criminal justice system, Iraqi criminal </p>
<p>tribunal and “improved regimes for detention facilities”. </p>
<p><b>Military Assistance Teams and Police Advisory Teams</b></p>
<p>From November 2003 to November 2004, the number of US soldiers whose primary </p>
<p>mission was to advise Iraqi units grew from 350 to 1,200.</p>
<p>625</p>
<p> Gen Luck advocated doubling </p>
<p>or tripling the number of advisers partnering Iraqi units and MNSTC&#8209;I expanded the </p>
<p>programme in response. </p>
<p>The ‘Iraq: Strategy for 2005’ paper considered by AHMGI on 9 February 2005 highlighted </p>
<p>that the idea of Military Assistance Teams (MATs) was supported (as this followed practice </p>
<p>in MND(SE)), but did “not favour” Police Advisory Teams (PATs).</p>
<p>626</p>
<p> It stated: “It is not yet </p>
<p>clear whether the US will adopt the latter proposal, which carries a high risk for those </p>
<p>embedded at local level.”</p>
<p>On MATs, the paper said that the UK “would not anticipate providing personnel for Military </p>
<p>Assistance Teams … outside our current area of operations”.</p>
<p>627</p>
<p>On 18 February, Mr Cornish advised Mr Hoon on an MOD review of the Iraq campaign, </p>
<p>looking at why the plan “was not delivering the required results”.</p>
<p>628</p>
<p> In considering the UK’s </p>
<p>involvement in “campaign enhancement”, Mr Cornish wrote: </p>
<p>“The US has accepted that the Security Sector Reform (SSR) models which the UK </p>
<p>are developing in MND(SE) to train and mentor ISF are likely to be different from </p>
<p>those that they might use elsewhere in Iraq.” </p>
<p>Delivering MATs was listed as one of the possible UK military initiatives. A footnote </p>
<p>explained:</p>
<p>“The MATs concept will be implemented using the UK model, which is based on </p>
<p>developing partner arrangements between UK and Iraq units, rather than embedding </p>
<p>individuals in Iraqi units (the US approach) … Because of Iraqi Ministerial objections </p>
<p>and force protection concerns, the PATs concept, as originally conceived (including </p>
<p>with MNF&#8209;I embedded in local police stations), is now all but dead.” </p>

<p>208</p>
<p>Major General Peter Wall, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations, attended a CENTCOM </p>
<p>conference on the post&#8209;election strategy for Iraq on 21 to 23 February.</p>
<p>629</p>
<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“MNF&#8209;I have walked back from their original PATs concept, though remained adamant </p>
<p>that the principle of hands&#8209;on help to the police would still be required in areas where </p>
<p>the insurgency was at its strongest … We are making progress in MND(SE). But we </p>
<p>also need to find a way of forcing this issue in Baghdad.” </p>
<p>THE “TRANSITION TO SELF RELIANCE”</p>
<p><b>691. </b> On 22 April 2005, Gen Casey circulated a paper entitled ‘MNF&#8209;I Campaign Action </p>
<p>Plan for 2005 – Transition to Self&#8209;Reliance’.</p>
<p>630</p>
<p> The paper stated that the Iraqi Armed </p>
<p>Forces would be “largely trained and equipped” by mid&#8209;2005 and that training of the </p>
<p>police and Border Police would extend into 2006. Gen Casey wrote:</p>
<p>“Generally, while Iraqi forces still lack the capacity to conduct and sustain </p>
<p>independent counter&#8209;insurgency operations, they now have the capacity to begin </p>
<p>assuming the lead in counter&#8209;insurgency operations across the country, and the </p>
<p>coalition can begin to progressively transition that responsibility to them.”</p>
<p><b>692. </b> That would be “executed in four phases”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase I, Implement the Transition Team Concept<b> </b>– MNF&#8209;I would “establish </p>
<p>partnerships between Iraqi and coalition units” and embed Transition Teams </p>
<p>in designated ISF units by 15 June 2005. Concurrently MNF&#8209;I with IRMO [Iraq </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Management Office] advisers would “build capacity to </p>
<p>continue the development of ISF leaders, organizations, supporting institutions </p>
<p>and Iraqi security Ministries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase II, Transition to Provincial Iraqi Security Control – coalition forces </p>
<p>would “pass the lead for conducting counter&#8209;insurgency operations to capable </p>
<p>ISF as conditions warrant”. The goal was to have the ISF in all provinces </p>
<p>“well&#8209;postured” to provide security for the elections in December, with the </p>
<p>coalition’s visibility reduced.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase III, Transition to National Iraqi Security Control – coalition forces to </p>
<p>“progressively reduce their levels of support and presence” as the ISF became </p>
<p>“increasingly capable”. Given the training timescales, it was “unlikely” that that </p>
<p>would occur “before mid&#8209;2006”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IV, Iraqi Security Self&#8209;Reliance – coalition forces would be “postured </p>
<p>in strategic overwatch outside of Iraq with training, security co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>and advisory presence remaining”, with the “exact nature” of support being </p>
<p>“determined in close co&#8209;ordination with the Government of Iraq”.</p>

<p>209</p>
<p><b>693. </b> Gen Casey stated that implementation of the strategy would “vary across Iraq </p>
<p>based on the security situation and the readiness of Iraqi security forces and Ministries”. </p>
<p><b>ISF performance during the January elections</b></p>
<p>Beginning on 28 January 2005, two days before the election, Iraqi authorities implemented </p>
<p>curfews, imposed severe restrictions on traffic, closed Iraq’s borders and banned the </p>
<p>carrying of weapons by civilians.</p>
<p>631</p>
<p> Approximately 130,000 ISF personnel secured over </p>
<p>5,000 polling sites throughout the country.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the election in a telephone call with President Bush on 31 January, Mr Blair </p>
<p>said it was encouraging that so many ISF had reported for duty over the weekend, but </p>
<p>the problem remained that they were not able to cope with “big battle situations” against </p>
<p>a well&#8209;armed and motivated enemy.</p>
<p>632</p>
<p> They lacked the necessary training and leadership. </p>
<p>The key question remained whether they could “take over, hold and run a major city”. </p>
<p>On 3 February, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“On election day, the Iraqi security forces reportedly performed effectively at </p>
<p>static guarding duties. But overall, their operational performance continues to be </p>
<p>inadequate, particularly in Sunni Arab areas.” </p>
<p>633</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Iraqi elections passed smoothly in MND(SE) with the GOC commenting that “the </p>
<p>ISF needed our help but their momentum gathered. They had the courage to stand up </p>
<p>and be counted.”</p>
<p>634</p>
<p> For the elections, Provincial Joint Operations Centres were </p>
<p>established in MND(SE) to improve co&#8209;ordination between different security elements. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Riley described them as “a crucial element in the security system that managed </p>
<p>election&#8209;day security”.</p>

<p>635</p>
<p> Drawing on the “Strategy for </p>
<p>2005” and the Luck Review, it contained proposals for a greater focus at the national </p>
<p>level where there was “an urgent need for an Iraqi national policing strategy, supported </p>
<p>by an appropriate training syllabus to address established weaknesses”. There </p>
<p>were 56,900 IPS officers now trained and equipped but there was still a need for the </p>
<p>development of leadership, technical capabilities, forensics, crime scene management </p>
<p>and investigative techniques.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Current UK commitments were summarised as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support for basic training – 86 officers<b> </b>in Jordan, az&#8209;Zubayr and Baghdad; </p>
<p>including a combination of serving and retired police officers and MOD </p>
<p>police officers, at a cost of £7.3m per annum from the GCPP International </p>
<p>Peacekeeping Fund;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enhancement of capabilities in MND(SE) – six senior and middle&#8209;ranking officers </p>
<p>mentoring Iraqi Provincial Chiefs of Police at a cost of £500,000 from the GCPP </p>
<p>International Peacekeeping Fund; 40 IPAs providing mentoring in the South </p>
<p>(through ArmorGroup), costing £4.8m for six months; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enhancement of national capabilities –<b> </b>Mr Davies’ role as Senior Civilian Adviser, </p>
<p>reporting to the Minister of Interior and supported by 12 officers in advisory roles </p>
<p>at a cost of £500,000 from the GCPP International Peacekeeping Fund.</p>
<p><b>696. </b> Two new priorities were identified arising from the 2005 Strategy: the development </p>
<p>of national strategies and the development of Iraqi intelligence capability. Developing </p>
<p>a Special Branch capability was still a UK priority but the Metropolitan Police would </p>
<p>currently not deploy staff to Baghdad on security grounds. </p>
<p><b>697. </b> The GCPP International Peacekeeping Fund could cover existing commitments but </p>
<p>was not able to meet new ones. New expenditure would therefore fall to the GCPP (Iraq) </p>
<p>fund. SSR so far amounted to £5.5m for 2005/06, not including the project to support the </p>
<p>MOI (£2.57m) or the human rights programme (£950,000). While funding was “available </p>
<p>for all planned police activity for the next six months”, an extension of the ArmorGroup </p>
<p>contract for a further six months would create an overspend. That would leave no </p>
<p>funding for renewing other contracts, such as the Prison Mentoring Contract, or for new </p>
<p>projects such as additional support for the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST– for trying crimes </p>
<p>committed under the Saddam Hussein regime). </p>
<p><b>698. </b> At the AHMGIR, the FCO said the “key message” from the paper was that funding </p>
<p>beyond September was “extremely tight”.</p>
<p>636</p>
<p> One of the points made in discussion was:</p>
<p>“The Government would need to be prepared to make tough decisions and prioritise </p>
<p>carefully on funding for activity in Iraq. There should be no expectation of drawing </p>
<p>down on the Treasury Reserve.”</p>
<p><b>699. </b> Officials were tasked with taking forward funding issues, with the close involvement </p>
<p>of the Home Office and ACPO.</p>

<p>211</p>
<p><b>700. </b> On 25 February, Mr Blair wrote a note to his Private Secretary, instructing that </p>
<p>Mr Straw be “put in charge” of the AHMGI and that each week a report is provided </p>
<p>containing actions on “e.g. reconstruction in the South; Sunni outreach; progress on </p>
<p>security plan”.</p>
<p>637</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>701. </b> On 10 March, at the first meeting of the AHMGI under his chairmanship, Mr Straw </p>
<p>explained that Mr Blair “had asked a core group of ministers to meet on a weekly basis </p>
<p>to focus more closely on the delivery of policy in Iraq”.</p>
<p>638</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>702. </b> One point made in discussion was that there was pressure within Iraq for </p>
<p>some unofficial militia to be incorporated into the ISF: “The benefits of bringing them </p>
<p>under greater control needed to be balanced against risk to ISF cohesion and political </p>
<p>complications”.</p>
<p><b>EU integrated police and Rule of Law mission for Iraq</b></p>
<p>On 21 February 2005, the EU announced that it had decided to establish an integrated </p>
<p>police and Rule of Law mission for Iraq, known as ‘EU JustLex’.</p>
<p>639</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s Private Secretary outlined the main elements of that mission in a letter to </p>
<p>No.10 on 10 March: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a planning office in Brussels to arrange senior management and specialist </p>
<p>technical training for 520 judges and criminal justice officials and 250 senior </p>
<p>police officers;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a five&#8209;man liaison office in Baghdad to identify specific projects where EU </p>
<p>member states could provide assistance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training that would take place in Member States or the region, but not in Iraq </p>
<p>until the security situation had improved.</p>
<p>640</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s Private Secretary wrote that the 21 February package had “followed months </p>
<p>of internal deliberations and a tough final negotiation”. While there was a “more positive </p>
<p>political mood, opposition to any association with MNF programmes or training in Iraq </p>
<p>remains strong”. He stated: </p>
<p>“… the package as it stands … is modest given the scale of the task and the </p>
<p>immediacy of the needs. If all goes to plan over the next year, the EU will provide </p>
<p>training for some 250 police officers. During this time, we [MNF] plan to train over </p>
<p>40,000 policemen through the academies in Baghdad, Basra and Amman.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>The operational phase of the mission began in July 2005 and was initially mandated to </p>
<p>run until 2006. Between 2005 and the end of 2009 it was headed by Former ACC Stephen </p>
<p>White, who had served as the UK’s Senior Police Adviser in Basra in 2003.</p>
<p>641</p>
<p> The mission </p>
<p>comprised around 40 staff and by June 2009 had spent €30m. Former ACC White </p>
<p>described the purpose of the mission as to:</p>
<p>“… focus … on the most senior members of the Iraqi police, judiciary and penitentiary </p>
<p>services … [to] create a critical mass of credible, influential leaders who are properly </p>
<p>equipped to make plans and decisions relevant to their responsibilities … in Iraq.”</p>
<p>642</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2009, the mission began to scope the provision of training and advice in Iraq and then </p>
<p>to progressively shift its focus to in&#8209;country work, opening additional offices in Erbil and </p>
<p>Basra.</p>
<p>643</p>
<p> By July 2010, the mission had trained, advised and mentored:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>805 judges (over 60 percent of the Iraqi judiciary);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1702 senior police officers (around four percent of senior police officers); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>903 prison officers (nearly 80 percent of senior prisons staff).</p>
<p><b>703. </b> On 14 March 2005, Mr Quarrey asked the MOD for an update on progress </p>
<p>against the Petraeus Plan.</p>
<p>644</p>
<p> Mr Naworynsky replied on 17 March and reported that ISF </p>
<p>development was: </p>
<p>“… largely on track, meeting the demands of a well&#8209;entrenched counter insurgency </p>
<p>campaign and the evolving expectation of the Iraqi leadership … From January 2006 </p>
<p>the ISF should be approaching full strength and the transfer of regional control will </p>
<p>be under way. Over the next six months of 2006, the generation of ISF units should </p>
<p>be complete, the Multi National Force (MNF) training and mentoring commitment </p>
<p>is expected to reduce, and in all but the most volatile provinces, Iraqi&#8209;led security </p>
<p>operations should become the norm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Trained and equipped MOI forces currently number almost 82,000 personnel, but </p>
<p>this includes a large number of absentees due to intimidation, injury, and corruption, </p>
<p>varying dramatically in proportion across the country … The largest component </p>
<p>(135,000) will be Iraqi Police Service (IPS), which remains an area for improvement. </p>
<p>Conceived for peace time constabulary duties, the rate of IPS development </p>
<p>continues to lag, as standards of equipment, personnel and training are reviewed to </p>
<p>answer the demands of the insurgency.” </p>

<p>213</p>
<p><b>704. </b> The covering note for Mr Blair from Mr Quarrey described the MOD’s paper as </p>
<p>“rather insubstantial, and almost certainly too optimistic in its assessment of the quality </p>
<p>of much of the ISF”.</p>
<p>645</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>705. </b> Lieutenent General Sir Graeme Lamb, General Officer Commanding (GOC) </p>
<p>MND(SE) from July to December 2003, reflected on the quality of the ISF in his evidence </p>
<p>to the Inquiry.</p>
<p>646</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p>“The point of corruption in this part of the world is with the police and at the lowest </p>
<p>level and yet we somehow were looking to try and make them into state troopers. </p>
<p>We were never going to achieve that. It was an aspect of us approaching in many </p>
<p>ways the problem seen through a Westminster or Washington perspective rather </p>
<p>than one that was very much more locally focused …”</p>
<p><b>706. </b> In a telephone call with President Bush on 22 April, Mr Blair commented that “the </p>
<p>Iraqiisation plan did seem to be going well”.</p>
<p>647</p>
<p> However, the insurgency remained well </p>
<p>armed and well financed. Mr Blair felt that there would be a greater sense of momentum </p>
<p>after the formation of the ITG. </p>
<p><b>707. </b> Lieutenant General John Kiszely served as the SBMR&#8209;I from October 2004 to </p>
<p>April 2005. His Hauldown Report contained an assessment of the ISF.</p>
<p>648</p>
<p> He described </p>
<p>the leadership of the IMOD as “completely out of their depth” and the MOI as </p>
<p>“dysfunctional”, with the Minister bringing in his uncle to set up and run the Special Police. </p>
<p><b>708. </b> In relation to the IPS, Lt Gen Kiszely assessed:</p>
<p>“… the selection process for these policemen … is rudimentary; they undertake </p>
<p>only eight weeks training; they are paid a very low wage; leadership at all levels is </p>
<p>generally poor; corruption is high. To expect such a force, mostly under&#8209;strength and </p>
<p>poorly equipped, to perform well in the face of a ruthless insurgency is unrealistic, </p>
<p>and there have been occasions (for example in Mosul in November) when the whole </p>
<p>of a city’s police force has deserted their police stations in the face of attack or the </p>
<p>threat of it.” </p>
<p><b>709. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely expressed concern about the Iraqi Special Police Commandos. He </p>
<p>considered that they had been “highly effective in tackling the insurgency” but he stated </p>
<p>that they had “no police training and are more akin to Black&#8209;and&#8209;Tans; many are former </p>
<p>members of the Republican Guard. Their methods are robust, and there have been </p>
<p>several cases of serious abuse, duly investigated, and no doubt many more that have </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>710. </b> On the insurgency, Lt Gen Kiszely assessed:</p>
<p>“The high level of intimidation has been the insurgency’s biggest gain of the past </p>
<p>six months and, helped by a weak, incompetent and corrupt police force, has led </p>
<p>in many Sunni areas to a complete absence of law and order – in effect, anarchy. </p>
<p>Initially intimidation was used by the insurgency to gain control of cities and towns, </p>
<p>the favoured method being to capture and execute (blindfold, hands tied behind </p>
<p>back) anyone who stood in the way of the insurgents or who was associated with </p>
<p>the coalition or the government. In one city (Mosul) in one five week&#8209;period (from </p>
<p>12 November to 19 December) the bodies of 220 victims executed in this way </p>
<p>were found, and in one single incident (Baquba, 23 October) a busload of 50 army </p>
<p>trainees were similarly murdered.”</p>
<p><b>711. </b> On INIS he wrote:</p>
<p>“In the past six months, INIS has been somewhat discredited in the eyes of both the </p>
<p>IIG and the coalition due to evidence of incompetence, corruption and penetration </p>
<p>by hostile agencies, both Iraqi and external … this is an area ripe for UK advice </p>
<p>and input.”</p>
<p><b>712. </b> On 15 May 2005, DCC Smith produced a report of his review of UK policing </p>
<p>support to the development of the IPS.</p>
<p>649</p>
<p> His report described UK efforts in both </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra; those recommendations relating to policing specifically in MND(SE) </p>
<p>are described later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>713. </b> DCC Smith observed a weakening of UK influence in Baghdad. Following the Luck </p>
<p>Review, the US was increasing resource for police training at a rate that the UK was </p>
<p>unable to match. He also reported that the “UK inability to ‘walk the talk’ and tendency to </p>
<p>write long, strategic doctrinal papers … has been interpreted by the US as typical British </p>
<p>procrastination”.</p>
<p><b>714. </b> DCC Smith recommended targeting UK resources on a number of priority areas to </p>
<p>increase influence at a strategic level in Baghdad. They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the strategic development of the IPS – “there are currently no resources, except </p>
<p>myself, dedicated to this key activity”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intelligence and crime investigation, including forensics, identified as “one of the </p>
<p>few areas where the UK still has a foothold”, thanks, in part to the introduction of </p>
<p>the TIPS scheme (described below); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing the Police Centre of Excellence – staffed primarily by Canadians, </p>
<p>this was described as “a small resource but a disproportionate influence [which] </p>
<p>helps to ‘fly the flag’ for policing in a land dominated by the Military”.</p>

<p><b>TIPS hotline</b></p>
<p>The ‘Police Forward Look’ paper produced in November 2006 described TIPS as:</p>
<p>“… the UK’s biggest success story, and one where we have delivered more </p>
<p>than we promised. The scheme has developed beyond the original plan, a </p>
<p>‘Crimestoppers’&#8209;style hotline, into a sophisticated intelligence system, including </p>
<p>source cultivation.”</p>
<p>650</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Former DCC Brand told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Because we had British policemen in there, there was a huge uptake of people </p>
<p>calling in, telling us about weapons and missiles and all sorts of things like that … </p>
<p>It was so successful that one of the last things that Mr Kerik did before he left was </p>
<p>to announce: ‘It was so successful we are now handing it over to the Iraqis’, and all </p>
<p>the calls stopped. So we had to reinstitute, because we understood after a while that </p>
<p>it was … the fact that people knew there were British police at the other end of the </p>
<p>phone made for the calls to happen, and that was a really successful part of our small </p>
<p>contribution.”</p>
<p>651</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his statement to the Inquiry, Former ACC Smith stated:</p>
<p>“TIPS in Baghdad generated increasing ‘actionable intelligence’ for coalition and Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces with reports averaging from 150 per week in early 2005 to over 400 </p>
<p>per week by the end of that year … TIPS was one of the real successes of the UK </p>
<p>work which … brought in a large volume of intelligence that undoubtedly saved many </p>
<p>Iraqi and coalition lives.”</p>
<p>652</p>
<p>In his report dated August 2006, Former Chief Superintendent Barton stated that there </p>
<p>were 14 ArmorGroup contractors working on the TIPS hotline.</p>
<p>653</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“The day&#8209;to&#8209;day successes (terrorist related arms finds, source development, target </p>
<p>development) is extremely successful [sic] and receives accolades from coalition </p>
<p>partners.</p>
<p>“However, to date, whilst Iraqi staff man the telephones there is no Iraqi ‘lead’ and </p>
<p>no Iraqi trainers.”</p>
<p>A recently developed Basra TIPS line was described by Former Chief Superintendent </p>
<p>Barton as “new and slow to start”.</p>
<p><b>715. </b> Five key areas were prioritised in DCC Smith’s report: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Training: Basic, Leadership and Developmental areas to be prioritised. Courses </p>

<p>216</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence Capability: the Collections, Collation, Analysis, Action and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Operational Capability: Police to have effective Command and Control Systems </p>
<p>with aim of Policy Primacy; Co&#8209;Ordination; Specialist Support SWAT [Special </p>
<p>Weapons and Tactics] and TSU [Tactical Support Unit]; Criminal Investigation </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Public Support: Development of Police interaction with the Criminal Justice </p>

<p>Civil Accountability; Ability to remove corrupt and inefficient police officers </p>
<p>through a robust, transparent and accountable Complaints System (Professional </p>
<p>Standards).”</p>
<p>654</p>
<p><b>716. </b> The report also analysed the UK resource requirement to meet those priorities and </p>
<p>sought to identify any gaps. DCC Smith commented that, while he knew how many UK </p>
<p>personnel were currently working on policing in Iraq, he was: </p>
<p>“… unsighted on … the overall ‘staffing’ allocation or budget for Iraq. There is no </p>
<p>clear indication of the number of posts that are budgeted by the FCO either in </p>
<p>Baghdad or Basra … This is not a personal failing on any department but reflects </p>
<p>a sometimes unstructured approach.” </p>
<p><b>717. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Former ACC Smith wrote that, although those five </p>
<p>areas became “the focus of successive plans”, the strategy itself “did not become, in the </p>
<p>long run, the driver in MND(SE)”.</p>
<p>655</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“Why? Perhaps lack of adequate consultation and explanation with the military, </p>
<p>possibly the changing situation on the ground or the military expectation that as </p>
<p>the main provider of resources etc they had the better understanding of the issues. </p>
<p>Attempts to support a strategic aim of ‘developing an efficient, effective, credible </p>
<p>and community&#8209;based accountable police service’ rapidly became subsumed within </p>
<p>military operational and logistical plans …</p>
<p>“In the absence of an agreed strategy, plans were driven on the ground by </p>
<p>successive six month military and staff rotations and changes in security and </p>
<p>political expectations.”</p>
<p><b>718. </b> On 10 June, DFID commissioned a consultant to “assist the FCO in drawing </p>
<p>together a cross&#8209;Whitehall strategy for UK support to the development of Iraqi policing </p>
<p>capacity”.</p>
<p>656</p>
<p> The Terms of Reference for the strategy stated that UK support needed “a </p>
<p>more strategic focus” and that FCO’s draft strategy now needed to be “expanded and </p>
<p>amended by inputs from the various department specialists”. The strategy should be </p>
<p>completed by 17 June. </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>217</p>
<p><b>719. </b> A junior DFID official emailed the FCO on 14 July to say that DFID felt that the </p>
<p>strategy could not be agreed across Whitehall.</p>
<p>657</p>
<p> He wrote: “We see your paper as </p>
<p>something that we have tried very hard to inform and influence, but have failed. It’s way </p>
<p>off something that we would wish to put our name to.” He suggested that it was instead </p>
<p>presented as an FCO&#8209;led document.</p>
<p><b>720. </b> On the same day, Commander Simon Huntingdon, MOD, emailed the FCO to say </p>
<p>that the MOD also did not feel the strategy represented an agreed FCO, DFID and MOD </p>
<p>position on policing in Iraq.</p>
<p>658</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>721. </b> On 18 July, MOD, DFID and FCO officials met to discuss policing in Iraq.</p>
<p>659</p>
<p> They </p>
<p>agreed that the strategy could not be viewed as “complete and usable” until additional </p>
<p>information was sent by the British Embassy. The minutes recorded:</p>
<p>“In the meantime, we should avoid giving the impression that policing was on track </p>
<p>when the reality was that we did not know.” </p>
<p><b>722. </b> The group agreed that a background paper on the strategy should be submitted </p>
<p>to senior officials on 22 July and possibly to Ministers afterwards. A second </p>
<p>cross&#8209;departmental paper would be submitted by the end of August outlining the </p>
<p>intended “end state” for the IPS, including “a route map of how to get there”, an analysis </p>
<p>of the risks (such as the sustainability of policing) and “an indication of the resources </p>
<p>required”. While the FCO accepted that it led policing activity in Iraq, it “stressed” the </p>
<p>need for all relevant departments to agree the papers; there was a “shared responsibility </p>
<p>for delivering policing”. </p>
<p><b>723. </b> Commenting on the draft background paper, an FCO junior official described </p>
<p>policing as “the Cinderella of SSR”.</p>
<p>660</p>
<p> The “reasons/factors” for that included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The insurgency broke the original plan, but no&#8209;one was prepared to admit it.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The international policing community has not responded adequately to Iraq” – </p>
<p>even the reduced figure of 1,500 (from 6,000) International Police Liaison </p>
<p>Officers (IPLOs) had not been achieved.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As the US was “the monopoly supplier of assets and people”, its “military vision </p>
<p>[had] prevailed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The original vision of the Iraqi police force as a community based service is </p>
<p>(and was) idealistic pie&#8209;in&#8209;the&#8209;sky. It does not fit with the culture or environment.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqis were seeking to balance the police against the army to prevent </p>
<p>a coup.</p>

<p>218</p>
<p><b>724. </b> The official wrote that the UK had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“over&#8209;promised and under&#8209;delivered”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“sent the wrong people and not enough of them”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“fixated on strategies that gather dust”, gaining a reputation with the US “for </p>
<p>procrastination rather than delivery”.</p>
<p><b>725. </b> The official wrote that there were “a lot of lessons to be learnt” and that the </p>
<p>absence of Home Office officials from the addressee list “tells its own story”.</p>
<p><b>726. </b> On 7 August, a junior official from the British Embassy Office Basra circulated a </p>
<p>draft of a policing transition paper.</p>
<p>661</p>
<p> He wrote that “the level of micro&#8209;management” </p>
<p>had “at times almost beggared belief” but that the police team in Basra had remained </p>
<p>committed to making it work “if only so the police here can get on with implementing it, </p>
<p>rather than sitting around re&#8209;editing it all day!” </p>

<p>experience. That took eight weeks, increasing to ten weeks in mid&#8209;2005.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Transition Integration Programme was a three&#8209;week programme for personnel </p>
<p>with previous police or military experience.</p>
<p>663</p>
<p> In July 2006, TIP training was </p>
<p>offered to serving officers who had not been trained but had been serving for </p>
<p>over a year.</p>
<p>664</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Training took place at the Jordan International Police Training College (JIPTC), the </p>
<p>Baghdad Police College and seven smaller regional academies; including az&#8209;Zubayr near </p>
<p>Basra.</p>
<p>665</p>
<p> By the end of 2006 all regional Iraqi Police academies had transitioned to Iraqi </p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>666</p>
<p> Basic recruit training ceased at JIPTC at the end of February 2007.</p>

<p>STRATEGIC CONFLICT ASSESSMENT AND SSR PROJECT REVIEW</p>
<p><b>728. </b> In October 2004, DFID commissioned a Strategic Conflict Assessment (SCA), an </p>
<p>analysis of conflict drivers in Iraq to help the UK Government identify conflict prevention </p>
<p>and reduction opportunities.</p>
<p>672</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>729. </b> A draft version of the SCA (dated 27 December 2004) was circulated amongst </p>
<p>officials on 2 March 2005.</p>
<p>673</p>
<p> The official circulating the document raised the need for </p>
<p>an objective assessment of the SSR work being done to “ensure we are on track, are </p>
<p>getting value for money, achieving aims” and making improvements where necessary. </p>
<p>An email from a DFID junior official in response said that Mr Benn was in support of </p>
<p>such a review.</p>
<p><b>730. </b> At the Iraq GCPP Strategy meeting on 7 April, it was reported that the final SCA </p>
<p>would be produced within a week and would feed into a revised GCPP Strategy for </p>
<p>2005/06.</p>
<p>674</p>
<p> In addition, the team conducting the SSR review would depart for Basra on </p>
<p>14 April and report in May. It would only focus on GCPP&#8209;funded activity. </p>
<p><b>731. </b> The SCA’s findings were discussed at the Iraq GCPP Strategy meeting on </p>

<p>675</p>
<p> Concerns were raised about the quality of the report; amendments were </p>

<p><b>734. </b> Minutes of the Iraq GCPP Strategy meeting on 3 August recorded that a draft of </p>

<p>678</p>
<p><b>735. </b> The objectives outlined in the GCPP Strategy for 2005/06 remained similar to </p>
<p>those in 2004/05 but were re&#8209;ordered and re&#8209;worded to reflect their “condensed scope” </p>
<p>and the shift in prioritisation.</p>
<p>679</p>
<p> They were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Build the capacity of the security sector to prevent and manage conflict, with </p>
<p>special emphasis on police and prisons.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support government and civil society institutions in preventing and resolving </p>
<p>conflict.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Promote good relations between groups inside Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>736. </b> It was identified that the 2004/05 Strategy had “proved too ambitious in the </p>
<p>worsening security context” and therefore 2005/06 objectives had been “narrowed </p>
<p>down” to reflect the difficulties surrounding implementation. Some of the SCA’s </p>
<p>recommendations would not be taken forward at that time, such as the recommendation </p>
<p>“for more support to the ISF in favour of the IPS”. The Strategy stated that the MOD had </p>
<p>a “large budget” for that purpose. The recommendations of the SSR review had been </p>
<p>accepted in their entirety.</p>

<p>undefined.”</p>
<p>683</p>
<p><b>740. </b> Mr Blair spoke to Prime Minister Ja’afari for the first time on 26 May and said that </p>
<p>“we stood ready to help in any way we could”, in particular on developing the ISF.</p>
<p>684</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>741. </b> On 3 August, a junior official in Baghdad emailed FCO officials and No.10 to inform </p>
<p>them that Prime Minister Ja’afari would announce a 12&#8209;point security plan the following </p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>685</p>
<p> The official described the intended announcement as “nothing particularly new”, </p>
<p>with the exception of a plan to co&#8209;ordinate intelligence, “neighbourhood watch”, and a </p>
<p>possible amnesty for political groups. The purpose of the plan was to structure activities </p>
<p>that the government and MNF&#8209;I had been taking into measurable objectives with actions </p>
<p>assigned to specific Ministers. </p>
<p><b>742. </b> Following the announcement, the official told Mr Asquith that Prime Minister </p>
<p>Ja’afari had been “ultra&#8209;cautious” and omitted “many of the details that were most </p>
<p>interesting”. He reported that the possible amnesty had been toned down to “national </p>
<p>dialogue with those with whom a dialogue is possible”.</p>
<p><b>743. </b> The JIC reported on 12 October that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) has failed to develop a coherent national </p>
<p>security strategy. This will not change in the short time remaining before the </p>
<p>December election. Nor will there be a significant increase of capacity in the security </p>
<p>ministries or development of intelligence capability. The need to establish a new </p>
<p>Iraqi administration following the elections means that we are likely to see little </p>
<p>momentum in these critical areas over much of the next year.”</p>

<p>“The requirement in Iraq was for paramilitary style policing. A plan was now in place </p>

<p>On 11 May 2005, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“Iraqi intelligence organisations will be critical for success: they are developing but </p>
<p>are still largely unproductive and unco&#8209;ordinated … Provincial and local structures are </p>
<p>also emerging. A number of these are under the control of rival militias and political </p>
<p>groups; some are Iranian financed. The degree to which these organisations are </p>
<p>able – or willing – to be absorbed into a national structure is unclear. The tensions </p>
<p>between the Ministers of Defence and Interior, and the addition of a new Ministry of </p>
<p>State for National Security, will complicate the issue.”</p>
<p>695</p>
<p>On 12 October, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“Some progress has been made, including establishing central co&#8209;ordinating </p>
<p>mechanisms … There is some co&#8209;ordination between INIS and DGIS, but overall </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordination remains poor. INIS is perceived by local politicians as run by the CIA; </p>
<p>DGIS is making some progress but is undeveloped and under&#8209;resourced; and the </p>
<p>MOI’s relationship with other agencies remains difficult …”</p>
<p>696</p>
<p>On 6 September 2007, a report from the Independent Commission on the Security Forces </p>
<p>in Iraq stated:</p>
<p>“The level of information sharing and cooperation between the Iraqi intelligence </p>
<p>community and the Iraqi Security Forces is not satisfactory – a problem </p>
<p>exacerbated by bureaucratic competition and distrust among duplicative intelligence </p>
<p>organisations.”</p>
<p> 697</p>
<p>The report advocated low technology solutions, describing Iraq as “principally a human </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>749. </b> Mr Roger Cornish, MOD Deputy Director Iraq, wrote to Mr Ingram’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary on 10 August with a draft note on ISF capacity&#8209;building.</p>
<p>699</p>
<p> He wrote that, </p>
<p>having read Lt Gen Brims’ report, Mr Blair had asked for further advice, giving “greater </p>
<p>clarity on ISF capacity&#8209;building. Specifically: exploring the detail beneath headline </p>
<p>numbers; discussing the delivery of equipment and training; assessing the Iraqi </p>
<p>command structure; and an honest assessment of the progress of Iraqiisation.” </p>
<p><b>750. </b> Dr John Reid became Defence Secretary in May 2005. Dr Reid sent Mr Cornish’s </p>
<p>note to Mr Blair on 28 August, advising that “numerically, generation of ISF remains on </p>
<p>track, but significant development in key capability areas is still needed”.</p>
<p>700</p>
<p> The problem </p>
<p>areas were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ability of IMOD forces to direct and sustain independent operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>equipment maintenance and effective command and control;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IMOD’s financial management, acquisition and logistics; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IPS’s progress – its capability thought to be 12 months behind the Iraqi Army.</p>
<p><b>751. </b> Dr Reid wrote that those issues were being addressed but that “with the focus on </p>
<p>quantity rather than quality, this inevitably will take time”. On the political control of the </p>
<p>ISF by the Iraqi Government, he stated:</p>
<p>“… the succession of short term ‘power sharing’ governments has not created the </p>
<p>conditions for the generation of coherent policies … Armed militias are a reality </p>
<p>and cannot be ignored; both the Kurds and Shia have them and their presence is </p>
<p>implicit in the form of local militias to protect businesses mentioned in PM Ja’afari’s </p>
<p>twelve&#8209;point security statement. We must beware that the ISF we are creating does </p>
<p>not migrate into yet more locally owned militias.”</p>
<p><b>752. </b> The IPS remained “riven with bribery, corruption, intimidation and politicisation” and </p>
<p>Special Police Commandos had been “linked to human rights abuses and extra judicial </p>
<p>killings”. Dr Reid wrote: </p>
<p>“Across Iraq, the Rule of Law is hampered by institutional fragility in the police and </p>
<p>criminal justice system. Shortcomings in basic infrastructure, equipment, training and </p>
<p>specialist capabilities such as forensics continue to limit IPS performance.”</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>Progress on disbanding militias</b></p>
<p>A report to Congress in July 2005 stated that, under CPA Order No.91, nine militias </p>
<p>were to be integrated into the ISF.</p>
<p>701</p>
<p> Of those nine, only the Kurdistan Democratic Party, </p>
<p>the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Peshmergas and the Badr Organisation remained as </p>
<p>“significant entities”. The other six organisations had either disbanded or been “assigned </p>
<p>to personal security details”. JAM was not part of the integration process as it was viewed </p>
<p>as a potential insurgent organisation rather than a militia. The report assessed:</p>
<p>“The ITG and its predecessor have had some success in integrating militias into the </p>
<p>ISF, but militia elements integrated into the ISF typically remain within pre&#8209;existing </p>
<p>organisational structures and retain their original loyalties or affiliations.”</p>
<p>The nature of the insurgency was discussed at the DOP(I) on 26 May.</p>
<p>702</p>
<p> Mr William </p>
<p>Ehrman, Chairman of the JIC, said that it was looking likely that elements of JAM would </p>
<p>be absorbed into the ISF. In discussion, concerns were raised about the Minister and the </p>
<p>Ministry of Interior, with rumours that the MOI was sanctioning sectarian attacks. </p>
<p>A JIC Assessment on 12 October stated:</p>
<p>“The issue of militias and their incorporation into the ISF has still not been resolved … </p>
<p>In the absence of an effective local ISF, the MOD with MNF support has begun to </p>
<p>recruit a Sunni tribal militia in Anbar province to help deal with AQ. In both Shia </p>
<p>and Sunni areas of Baghdad there have been calls for local militias to be raised to </p>
<p>improve security. We judge the perpetuation of militia forces, on ethnic, tribal, or </p>
<p>political lines, carries significant risks for the future.”</p>
<p>703</p>
<p><b>753. </b> Dr Reid’s letter to the Prime Minister on 28 August 2005 made clear that </p>
<p>the original timescale for the completion of the Petraeus Plan (mid&#8209;2006) was not </p>
<p>achievable.</p>
<p>704</p>
<p> The number of trained and equipped IMOD forces was “just below </p>
<p>80,000” and would “reach full authorised strength (currently 106,000) in November </p>
<p>2006”. MOI force numbers were “just over 95,000” and “should reach full strength </p>
<p>(193,500) in 2007”. </p>
<p><b>754. </b> A JIC Assessment about the ISF on 12 October reported that the forces had </p>
<p>“again expanded rapidly”: the Iraqi Armed Forces stood at 91,000 personnel and MOI </p>
<p>forces 106,000 personnel.</p>
<p>705</p>
<p> The JIC cautioned that those figures did not take account </p>
<p>of absenteeism or “provide an indication of true capability”. MNF planners foresaw a </p>
<p>continued need for substantial MNF forces, capable of conducting combat operations, </p>

<p>to support the ISF until the end of 2007, and for advisory teams at least until 2009. </p>
<p>Assessing those targets, the JIC judged: </p>
<p>“… the ISF and MNF together have been unable to contain the level of violence, </p>
<p>which continues to grow. If the insurgency persists at anywhere near current </p>
<p>levels, these timeframes will be unachievable, at least in Baghdad and the </p>

<p><b>Assessing readiness for Provincial Iraqi Control</b></p>
<p>On 27 September 2005, an IPU official wrote to Mr Straw with details of the Joint Committee </p>
<p>to Transfer Security Responsibility (JCTSR). The JCTSR had been established in July and </p>
<p>tasked with establishing the conditions to permit transfer of security responsibility to the </p>
<p>Iraqi civilian authorities.</p>
<p>707</p>
<p> Membership included the Iraqi Interior and Defence Ministers, </p>
<p>the National Security Adviser, the UK and the US Ambassadors and the Commander and </p>
<p>Deputy Commander of MNF&#8209;I.</p>
<p>The Committee published its conditions for transferring security responsibility to an Iraqi </p>
<p>civilian authority on 10 October 2005.</p>
<p>708</p>
<p> Those fell into four categories for both urban and </p>
<p>provincial areas: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Threat assessment: MOI, IMOD, MNF&#8209;I and the National Intelligence </p>
<p>Coordination Council (NICC) assess the threat from terrorist/insurgents as </p>
<p>low, and steady or on a downward trend determined by the IMOD, MOI and </p>
<p>MNF&#8209;I. For provincial areas, the threat to critical infrastructure and lines of </p>
<p>communication should also be assessed as low.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi Security Forces readiness: The IPS has capacity (at TRA level 2 [TRA </p>
<p>levels are explained in Box, ‘Provincial Iraqi Control’]) to maintain domestic order </p>
<p>and prevent the resurgence of terrorism. The Iraqi Army are able to respond to </p>
<p>requests for assistance from the city and able to contain the insurgency in the </p>
<p>provinces with appropriate support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Governance: The Governor must be capable of overseeing security operations </p>
<p>in the urban area and province, as assessed by the IMOD, MOI, Ministry of </p>
<p>Justice, the Ministry of Human Rights, the US Embassy and MNF&#8209;I. The PJCC </p>
<p>must be operational and co&#8209;ordinating operations and there must be systems in </p>
<p>place for detention, trial and incarceration under Iraqi law.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition forces: must maintain the capability to reinforce if ISF capabilities </p>
<p>are exceeded; co&#8209;ordinate civil construction activities; provide support and </p>
<p>force protection for Transition Teams; and retain freedom of movement and the </p>
<p>capability to conduct counter&#8209;terrorism operations. </p>

<p><b>Corruption, infiltration and abuse</b></p>
<p><b>756. </b> Despite improvements in size and performance of the ISF, concerns about </p>
<p>corruption, infiltration and abuse continued to grow during 2005. The incident on </p>
<p>19 September at the Jameat Police Station in Basra is described later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>757. </b> In its 12 October Assessment, the JIC reported that both the IMOD and the MOI </p>
<p>were “dysfunctional, with their capacities developing very slowly if at all” and that neither </p>
<p>could “administer their forces effectively”.</p>
<p>709</p>
<p> Units were unpaid and unsupplied for </p>
<p>significant periods and nepotism was ingrained.</p>
<p><b>758. </b> The JIC repeated its warnings about the IPS, judging:</p>
<p>“Elements of the ISF, primarily those under Ministry of Interior (MOI) control, are </p>
<p>involved in sectarian violence. This is fuelling broader tensions across Iraq. </p>
<p>“The Iraqi police are a particular concern. They often suffer from divided loyalties </p>
<p>and a significant number are involved in criminality for financial gain. Their command </p>
<p>and control mechanisms remain confused, as does the exact relationship between </p>
<p>local police and the MOI in Baghdad.” </p>
<p><b>759. </b> The JIC reported that some senior Iraqi politicians viewed MOI paramilitary units </p>
<p>as “a particular problem: they are seen as a Shia force and as perpetrating a campaign </p>
<p>of violence against Sunnis”.</p>
<p><b>760. </b> On 25 October, Mr Blair and President Bush held a video conference between </p>
<p>London, Washington and Baghdad.</p>
<p>710</p>
<p> Mr Straw and a number of officials and military </p>
<p>officers were in attendance. They discussed Iraqiisation. Mr Blair said that the </p>
<p>development of the police seemed to be lagging behind that of the army and asked </p>
<p>what more could be done. He also asked how important were the Ministries of Interior </p>
<p>and Defence. He was told that a major effort was required with the police in 2006 and </p>
<p>that the Ministries were crucial. Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, SBMR&#8209;I from </p>
<p>October 2005 to March 2006, said that the problem with the police was not limited to </p>
<p>their quantity and quality; there was also an issue with the commitment to national goals. </p>
<p>Strong national leadership was required at the political level. </p>
<p><b>761. </b> In response to a question from President Bush about the situation in the </p>
<p>South, Sir William Patey, British Ambassador to Iraq, stated that the political process </p>
<p>had exposed deep divisions within the Shia and that those had impacted on local </p>
<p>government. He warned of “local turf wars”, declining consent for the MNF, and Iranian </p>
<p>interference. He stated that the police were key and training efforts needed to be </p>
<p>stepped up. Lt Gen Houghton said that the situation in the South remained much calmer </p>
<p>than in other parts of the country. Progress had been made on SSR and the South might </p>
<p>well be able to lead the process of security transition.</p>

<p><b>Responsibility for the security ministries moves to MNSTC&#8209;I</b></p>
<p>A report to Congress on 13 October 2005 stated that the US Embassy Iraq and MNF&#8209;I had </p>
<p>“recently agreed” to assign responsibility for the Iraqi security ministries’ development to </p>
<p>MNSTC&#8209;I with effect from 1 October 2005.</p>
<p>711</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A paper produced by the MOD for DOP(I) on 15 November stated:</p>
<p>“MNSTC&#8209;I has overall responsibility for providing assistance … to the IG [Iraqi </p>
<p>Government] in the development of the MOD and MOI. This helps to generate some </p>
<p>short&#8209;term capacity assistance; however, the UK must use its senior representation </p>

<p>sector. This can be achieved through full manning of agreed liaison posts throughout </p>
<p>the IG and recognising the need for local participation and ownership at all stages of </p>
<p>the capacity&#8209;building project.”</p>
<p>712</p>
<p>An eGram from Baghdad on 2 November reported that merging efforts on MOI </p>
<p>reform “should combine IRMO civilian expertise with MNSTC&#8209;I military resources and </p>
<p>manpower”.</p>
<p>713</p>
<p> The “bedding&#8209;in process [was] still under way” and “some tension between </p>
<p>the civilian element and the military” remained.</p>
<p>In his weekly report of 1 January 2006, DCC Smith stated that military personnel were </p>
<p>gradually replacing police officers in key CPATT roles.</p>
<p>714</p>
<p> He cited the upcoming vacancy for </p>
<p>a Senior IPLO Advisor post at CPATT as “a further opportunity for Senior UK influence” and </p>
<p>that if the UK was to embed officers into CPATT, it was “essential” that it include a senior </p>
<p>strategic position or the UK would “simply be providing more ‘indians’”. DCC Smith was “not </p>
<p>convinced” that the US would allow the post to be taken by a “non&#8209;American”. He described </p>
<p>“a weakening morale among IPLO colleagues and … increased military encroachment”.</p>
<p>A report to Congress on 26 May reported that MNSTC&#8209;I had awarded a contract to provide </p>
<p>civilian experts to help build organisational capacity by working alongside Iraqi officials in </p>
<p>the IMOD and MOI in February that year.</p>
<p>715</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An eGram was sent from Baghdad on 8 September about the development of the MOI </p>
<p>and progress of the GCPP&#8209;funded project (as described earlier in this Section).</p>
<p>716</p>
<p> It said </p>
<p>that a new structure for the MOI was “now more or less in place”, although there were still </p>
<p>insufficient systems in place to reduce corruption and staff had difficulties delegating tasks </p>
<p>because they lacked the understanding about how responsibility should be matched with </p>
<p>accountability and authority. </p>
<p>The eGram acknowledged that capacity&#8209;building was a long&#8209;term process but that </p>
<p>“measurable progress” had been made. Collaboration with MNSTC&#8209;I had been “very </p>
<p>good” and represented “an example of how civilian (DFID) and military (MNSTC&#8209;I) efforts </p>
<p>can effectively complement each other”. </p>

<p>THE JADIRIYAH BUNKER</p>
<p><b>762. </b> On 13 November, the US military visited an MOI&#8209;controlled detention facility in </p>
<p>Baghdad, known as the Jadiriyah bunker, to facilitate the release of a detainee.</p>
<p>717</p>
<p> Upon </p>
<p>entering the facility they discovered “around 170 detainees” in an emaciated state. </p>
<p>Instruments of torture, including belts, rubber hoses, electrical cable and truncheons </p>
<p>were recovered and there was evidence of links to the Badr Corps militia. </p>
<p><b>763. </b> The following day, Gen Casey and Mr David Satterfield, the US Deputy Chief </p>
<p>of Mission, made a strong demarche</p>
<p>718</p>
<p> to Mr Jabr, and demanded both a full criminal </p>
<p>investigation and a nationwide audit and inspection of MOI facilities conducted by Iraqi </p>
<p>and US officials. </p>
<p><b>764. </b> In the Chairman’s brief for DOP(I) to be held on 15 November, Mr Blair </p>
<p>was advised that Mr Patey should raise the issue “in the strongest terms” with </p>
<p>Prime Minister Ja’afari and Mr Jabr.</p>
<p>719</p>
<p><b>765. </b> A note from an IPU official to Mr Straw on 22 November stated that Prime Minister </p>
<p>Ja’afari had announced on 15 November that a full investigation into the matter would </p>
<p>be held.</p>
<p>720</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>766. </b> The official advised Mr Straw that the Embassy had “first picked up suspicions </p>
<p>about maltreatment” at the facility on 4 and 5 September in “an uncorroborated informant </p>
<p>report to a police adviser”. The Embassy’s Senior Police Adviser had accompanied the </p>
<p>US military to the location on 24 October but saw no evidence of abuse in the areas </p>
<p>where he was allowed access. The official wrote that before follow&#8209;up action could be </p>
<p>taken, the US had “stumbled” upon the mis&#8209;treated detainees. </p>
<p><b>767. </b> There were indications that Mr Jabr had “been in direct contact with MOI </p>
<p>operatives at the Bunker” and that there were “suspicions of other illegal detention </p>
<p>centres”. The media had reported Mr Jabr was “playing down the incident significantly”. </p>
<p><b>768. </b> The IPU would “instruct Baghdad to maintain pressure” on Prime Minister Ja’afari </p>
<p>to address the issues. </p>
<p><b>769. </b> Mr Straw issued a statement the same day, welcoming this decision and </p>
<p>condemning illegal detention and torture.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>770. </b> On 27 November, <i>The Observer</i> published an article on human rights abuses in </p>
<p>Iraq, based on an interview with Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi.</p>
<p>721</p>
<p> It quoted him as </p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>“The Ministry of the Interior is at the heart of the matter. I am not blaming the </p>
<p>Minister himself, but the rank and file are behind the secret dungeons and some of </p>
<p>the executions that are taking place.”</p>
<p><b>771. </b> The IPU was concerned that the investigation would slip in the run&#8209;up to elections, </p>
<p>and advised Mr Straw on 2 December to reiterate the importance of its progress during </p>
<p>a telephone call with Prime Minister Ja’afari.</p>
<p>722</p>
<p> The IPU had “received indications” that </p>
<p>a representative on the investigation committee and an Iraqi Minister were “trying to </p>
<p>whitewash the report”. Concurrently, the IPU was considering with the US and the MOD </p>
<p>“the possibility of taking direct MNF&#8209;I action” in other suspected locations of abuse.</p>
<p><b>772. </b> The IPU raised concerns about the delay in the investigation again with Mr Straw </p>
<p>on 7 December.</p>
<p>723</p>
<p> A note by a junior official advised Mr Straw to raise the matter with </p>
<p>Dr Rice during their bilateral meeting that day. The note said that no action had been </p>
<p>taken, other than two meetings of Deputy Prime Minister Rosch Shaway’s committee. </p>
<p><b>773. </b> As well as continuing to apply pressure for a report to be delivered, the official </p>
<p>advised Mr Straw to suggest “snap inspections” of other locations, which ideally would </p>
<p>be Iraqi&#8209;led, but could be led by MNF&#8209;I if necessary. </p>
<p><b>774. </b> An eGram sent from the British Embassy on 17 January 2006 stated that there </p>
<p>was “still no sign of any report”.</p>
<p>724</p>
<p> Mr Shaway had spoken to the US on 16 January </p>
<p>and had blamed the delay on Shia and Badr members appointed to the Commission by </p>
<p>Prime Minister Ja’afari and difficulties in working around the election and local holidays. </p>
<p>He had told the US that he intended to report in between 10 and 14 days. </p>
<p><b>775. </b> The eGram also stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been three unannounced inspections of detention facilities by joint </p>
<p>Iraqi/MNF&#8209;I forces. The US/MNF&#8209;I selected the sites but Iraqi officials led the </p>
<p>investigations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Details had been provided about two of the inspections, one facility had </p>
<p>234 detainees claiming abuse (though mostly from previous facilities and not </p>
<p>within the last two months), and the other held 13 detainees and was “of a fairly </p>
<p>good standard”.</p>

<p>725</p>
<p> Detention </p>
<p>was a particular cause of concern. The DoD’s May 2006 Report to Congress stated:</p>
<p>“Many human rights violations occur at detention centres because the centres have </p>
<p>inadequate facilities. The centres have no places to shower, pray, or prepare food; </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>780. </b> Dr Reid, who chaired the meeting, concluded that it was “critical” to the UK’s </p>
<p>objectives that the Iraqi security forces were non&#8209;sectarian; officials “should work </p>
<p>urgently on an action plan and messages for use with the US … and an incoming </p>
<p>Iraqi Government”.</p>
<p><b>781. </b> On 20 April, an email from Mr Straw’s Private Secretary to a junior FCO official </p>
<p>stated that Ms Clwyd had raised the delayed publication of the Iraqi investigation’s </p>
<p>report with Mr Straw that morning: “She asked what we could do to force the publication </p>
<p>of the report.”</p>
<p>729</p>
<p><b>782. </b> A junior official in Baghdad relayed a telephone conversation between Ms Clwyd </p>
<p>and Mr Patey.</p>
<p>730</p>
<p> Mr Patey said:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Shaways had passed Mr Patey a copy of the report on 19 April.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The report was consistent with the US report but was “not as hard&#8209;hitting in </p>
<p>implicating those involved”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had been sent to Prime Minister Ja’afari but was only signed by Mr Shaways </p>
<p>(and not other members of the committee). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no indication that it would be released or acted upon until a </p>
<p>government was formed, after which recommendations could be made public.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The report would not damage Mr Ja’afari but “would be seen as an attack on </p>
<p>SCIRI”.</p>
<p><b>783. </b> Mr Patey also said that other work was in hand on detainee abuse: the bunker </p>
<p>was closed, spot&#8209;inspections continued, and the UK was working to remove SCIRI’s </p>
<p>influence on the MOI. It wanted to stop the MOI running detention facilities in the longer </p>
<p>term. Ms Clwyd “seemed broadly content with this explanation”. </p>
<p><b>784. </b> On 5 May 2006, Mrs Margaret Beckett became Foreign Secretary. On 9 June, an </p>
<p>IPU official advised her that “serious abuse and torture”, including of juveniles, had been </p>
<p>discovered at another detention facility (“Site 4”) on 30 May.</p>
<p>731</p>
<p> Mr Khalilzad had taken </p>
<p>“swift action” with the newly elected Prime Minister, Mr Nuri al&#8209;Maliki, “pressing him to </p>
<p>take public action” and to revisit the Jadiriyah bunker incident. Mr Al&#8209;Mailki’s response </p>
<p>was “positive”; he committed to establishing a committee to investigate the Site 4 </p>
<p>incident. </p>
<p><b>785. </b> On 19 September, an eGram from Mr Dominic Asquith, now British Ambassador </p>
<p>to Iraq, reported that investigations into Jadiriyah and Site 4 abuse were still ongoing.</p>

<p>resistance on the basis that security conditions made it difficult. </p>
<p><b>786. </b> Mr Asquith considered Mr Al&#8209;Shibli “honest and aware of the problems”, but that he </p>
<p>had a “weak political base” and an “inability to confront effectively the powerful vested </p>

<p>police force that can help enforce the Rule of Law [was] vital to any exit strategy”.</p>
<p>733</p>
<p><b>788. </b> The official wrote that UK police officers were embedded within CPATT and </p>

<p>CPATT and MNSTC&#8209;I. The official wrote that the US had indicated they wanted the UK to </p>
<p>“do more” in discrete areas, such as forensics. They stated that another possibility was </p>
<p>to embed a high&#8209;ranking police officer in CPATT to help direct strategic development but </p>

<p>the Iraqi Police were making an “increasingly significant contribution” but were </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>malign militia influence, incompetent personnel and weak national control were </p>
<p>issues that needed to be addressed by the new government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Department of Border Enforcement (DBE) was due to reach full strength by </p>
<p>May 2006; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi Navy was a “success story” that risked being undermined by the failure </p>

<p>234</p>
<p><b>791. </b> The second paper was entitled “Ensuring the Iraqis are Ready for a Handover </p>
<p>of Security Responsibility”. It highlighted two high level areas where there was cause </p>
<p>for concern:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the output of the Ministries – their ability to command, control and sustain their </p>
<p>security forces, with control of the Chiefs of Police being a “major issue”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the proper government control of the Ministries. </p>
<p><b>792. </b> The paper stated that the coalition had “got what we resourced”: an increasing </p>
<p>number of officers on the ground but no overarching leadership and control from the </p>
<p>Ministries to which they were responsible. Action in the first 100 days of government </p>
<p>was seen as “essential”. MNSTC&#8209;I was developing a plan on that basis, with a surge </p>
<p>in resources:</p>
<p>“… MOI advisers up from 76 to 113; MOD advisers up from 45 … to 103. It is </p>
<p>envisaged that military, civilian and contractors will be used to fill civilian slots.”</p>
<p><b>793. </b> The paper made a number of recommendations, including that consideration </p>
<p>should be given to increasing the number of UK security sector advisers (to “include </p>
<p>some ‘doers’ in IMOD”) and measures to strengthen government control including </p>
<p>bolstering the MCNS. </p>
<p><b>794. </b> The minutes of the meeting indicated that those recommendations were not </p>
<p>explicitly addressed.</p>
<p>736</p>
<p><b>795. </b> On 23 December, Mr Blair sent a Note to President Bush.</p>
<p>737</p>
<p> On Iraqiisation, he wrote:</p>
<p>“I was surprised people were more upbeat than I expected (and most important the </p>
<p>ordinary soldiers working alongside Iraqis). The two clear messages were: the vital </p>
<p>nature of leadership of the MOI and MOD; and 2006 being the year of the police. </p>
<p>There may also be equipment issues with the military and the police.” </p>
<p><b>796. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton said:</p>
<p>“It is quite difficult to compartmentalise the aspiration and the optimism of late </p>
<p>2005 … the realities of the true state of the police were more dawning realities, as </p>
<p>we moved into 2006, where some of the … problems about death squads, torture </p>
<p>dens, the degree of militia infiltration of police, both nationally and locally in Basra, </p>
<p>became more evident, and I think that probably it was the policing issue that lay on </p>
<p>the critical path to most of the conditionality for effective transition.</p>
<p>“… 2006 was to be the year of the police, so it is not as if we were not aware of the </p>
<p>fact that this was the critical problem.</p>

<p>“But I think that the degree of the problem, just recalling another sense of the time, </p>
<p>is that we could pour significant resource into … training the police and in the </p>
<p>quantity of their generation but we never had the ability to command their loyalty at </p>
<p>a local level or a national level.</p>
<p>“This is where you probably get into the dark business of the degree to which police </p>
<p>loyalties were affected by political loyalties, links to criminality and corruption, and </p>
<p>I don’t think that we had a full understanding of that at the back end of 2005. That </p>
<p>was more revealed to us incrementally, as 2006 ensued.”</p>
<p>738</p>
<p><b>797. </b> In his weekly report of 1 January 2006, DCC Smith wrote about the “Year of </p>
<p>the Police”: “… the strap line that ‘just enough is good enough’ is, whilst probably </p>
<p>realistic, not particularly encouraging”. He wrote that it could be “a defining factor in </p>
<p>the development of an effective Iraqi Police Service”.</p>

<p><b>The Iraqi border police </b></p>
<p>The Department of Border Enforcement (DBE) was established in 2003.</p>
<p>740</p>
<p> A report to </p>
<p>Congress on 7 March 2008 described the DBE as having two key missions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ports of Entry (POE) policing to ensure the smooth transition of legal goods and </p>
<p>persons; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to interdict illegal traffic – including smuggling and movement of terrorists and foreign </p>
<p>fighters – within and between POE.</p>
<p>Securing Iraq’s border was a considerable task – in total Iraq has 2,268 miles of land </p>
<p>border and 36 miles of coastline.</p>
<p>741</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In June 2004, Maj Gen Houghton described the DBE as “successfully … reconstituted </p>
<p>with over 19,000 Iraqis now in roles as border police, customs officers, immigration </p>
<p>officers and nationality and passport officers”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>In a report to Congress on 13 October 2005, the DoD assessed:</p>
<p>“The decentralised and dispersed nature of this force has fostered an environment in </p>
<p>which corruption, “ghost” employees [employees on the payroll but not presenting for </p>
<p>duty], and absent without leave rates remain a significant concern.”</p>
<p>745</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>798. </b> DCC Smith completed his tour of Iraq in April 2006.</p>
<p>746</p>
<p> He described a number of </p>
<p>difficulties experienced during his tour in his end of mission report, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of an agreed, resourced strategy: “There was not a shortage of … plans … </p>
<p>What has been lacking for three years is a will and an organisational capability </p>
<p>to develop, and act upon, such a strategy”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confusion over command of various personnel involved in policing: “Even the </p>
<p>Review conducted by Sir Ronnie Flanagan [HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary; </p>
<p>the Review is described later in this Section] … failed to provide a clear </p>
<p>statement”, with the security situation making a military lead inevitable in 2006; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>prioritisation of scarce resources: he highlighted a number of areas where the </p>
<p>UK could have played a significant role but were unable to resource initiatives </p>
<p>either through funding or appropriate personnel. </p>
<p><b>The rise in sectarianism</b></p>
<p><b>799. </b> Elections were held in December 2005 but it was not until May 2006 that the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government was formed (see Section 9.4). As the period of time taken to form a new </p>
<p>government extended, British military commanders in Iraq observed an increase in </p>
<p>violence.</p>
<p>747</p>
<p><b>800. </b> A report to Congress on 30 November 2006 stated that Sunni and Shia “death </p>
<p>squads” were responsible for the significant increase in sectarian violence in Iraq.</p>
<p>748</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those were defined as “armed groups that conduct extra&#8209;judicial killings; formed from </p>
<p>terrorists, militias, illegal armed groups, and – in some cases – elements of the ISF”.</p>
<p><b>801. </b> During his visit to Baghdad in March 2006, Dr Reid had raised the role of the militia </p>
<p>with a number of interlocutors.</p>
<p>749</p>
<p> Mr Sa’adoun al&#8209;Dulaimi, Iraqi Minister for Defence, </p>
<p>reported that he felt under pressure to incorporate sectarian militias into the IMOD, </p>
<p>noting that “the Ministry of the Interior seemed completely open to the integration of </p>
<p>militias”. Mr Jabr commented that “too many old regime staff had been brought back in” </p>
<p>and “could not simply be removed”.</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>237</p>
<p><b>802. </b> A JIC Assessment on sectarianism in Iraq on 5 April stated: </p>
<p>“The MNF and Iraqi security forces (ISF) have been able to constrain only some </p>
<p>of the violence. After the Samarra mosque bombing, MNF reporting indicated the </p>
<p>Iraqi Army proved effective in many areas, deploying in numbers to protect both </p>
<p>Sunni and Shia mosques. Some local police units also performed well, although the </p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior (MOI) itself was sluggish in its response. The imposition of a </p>
<p>curfew and a large security force presence probably deterred some violence. But the </p>
<p>picture is patchy: in some Shia areas of Baghdad, militias were allowed free rein. </p>
<p>“The most focused and disciplined anti&#8209;Sunni campaign is being run by SCIRI’s </p>
<p>Badr<b> </b>organisation. Since the formation of the interim government, SCIRI has </p>
<p>systematically embedded Badr members and units into the state security structures, </p>
<p>particularly the MOI where they control intelligence and some paramilitary units. </p>
<p>Forces under the control of the Ministry of Defence, with its close ties to MNF, have </p>
<p>proved less penetrable …”</p>
<p>750</p>
<p><b>803. </b> On 20 April, Lt Gen Fry, now SBMR&#8209;I, was asked by Mr Blair to give DOP(I) his </p>
<p>assessment of the capacity of the Iraqi Army and police, and what impact the new </p>
<p>government would have.</p>
<p>751</p>
<p> He stated that progress with the army was relatively positive, </p>
<p>but progress with the police was less good; the “weakness and sectarian bias of the </p>
<p>Ministry of Interior” had “exacerbated” problems. He judged that “the key challenge … </p>
<p>remained to bring in the Sunnis”.</p>
<p><b>804. </b> In discussion at DOP(I) the following points were raised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK should not underestimate the sectarian character of the ISF, the new </p>
<p>government would need to tackle this issue actively; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK had to be realistic about how possible it would be to develop </p>
<p>non&#8209;sectarian forces at that stage in Iraq’s development. </p>
<p><b>SSR in the South: summer 2004 to summer 2006</b></p>
<p><b>805. </b> On 15 July 2004, the FCO produced a paper considering the options for the </p>
<p>commitment of UK police officers in southern Iraq after handover of sovereignty to the </p>
<p>IIG.</p>
<p>752</p>
<p> The FCO recommended maintaining current staffing levels until mid&#8209;2005, which </p>
<p>could mean extending ArmorGroup’s contract and a further roulement</p>
<p>753</p>
<p> of UK police </p>
<p>trainers. That would recognise “that SSR remains a main effort for the UK” and mirrored </p>
<p>current MNSTC&#8209;I and CPATT projections on the completion of IPS training. The paper </p>
<p>noted that “the UK would have a diminishing influence if we were to withdraw before IPS </p>
<p>training was complete”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>806. </b> On 29 August, Lt Gen McColl reported that Prime Minister Allawi had decided </p>
<p>to appoint an Iraqi Military Commander for southern Iraq – initially for Basra and </p>
<p>Maysan.</p>
<p>754</p>
<p> The Military Commander would have command of all the ISF in the area </p>
<p>and be answerable to a committee in Baghdad, made up of the Prime Minister and the </p>
<p>Ministers of the Interior and Defence. Lt Gen McColl’s view was that there was “plenty </p>
<p>of scope for friction” between the local Military Commander’s HQ and those of the GOC </p>
<p>MND(SE), now Major General William Rollo, who was reported to be concerned about </p>
<p>the introduction of “another layer of approval and consultation before forces can be </p>
<p>deployed”. </p>
<p><b>807. </b> On 2 September, Maj Gen Rollo reported that Prime Minister Allawi was </p>
<p>considering the appointment of General Rachash as Military Commander of the </p>
<p>South&#8209;East. Maj Gen Rollo had concerns about Gen Rachash’s views on the need </p>
<p>to consult provincial Governors and the lack of legal basis for his appointment.</p>
<p>755</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Security restrictions on UK police officers</b></p>
<p>On 26 September 2004, a report from Mr Robert Davies, Chief Police Adviser to the </p>
<p>MOI, stated that the FCO’s Overseas Security Adviser had directed UK police staff not </p>
<p>to travel in Snatch Land Rovers because of inadequate armour (see Section 14.1).</p>
<p>756</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Davies wrote:</p>
<p>“This direction places a significant limitation on the deployment of our staff. The role </p>
<p>of mentors requires them to be able to travel frequently to see their chiefs of police. </p>
<p>The essence of their role and indeed, the role of the International Police Advisers, </p>
<p>needs them to go to the stations. The appropriate protection could be provided by </p>
<p>a team from the Control Risk Group, but there are insufficient numbers to meet </p>
<p>our requirement.”</p>
<p>In March 2005, DCC Smith wrote to Mr Stuart Innes, British Consul General Basra, about </p>
<p>travel and movement protection in Basra.</p>
<p>757</p>
<p> He raised concerns that UK police officers </p>
<p>were subject to an “inflexible and restrictive” policy that was “likely to hamper the conduct </p>
<p>of work in the next 12 months”. In particular, UK police officers could only travel overland </p>
<p>by vehicle if accompanied by a team of bodyguards. That was during daylight hours only </p>
<p>and with 24 hours’ notice. However, ArmorGroup and Dyncorp officers were able to travel </p>
<p>by military vehicles, unaccompanied and without such tight restrictions. </p>
<p>DCC Smith stated that, as the policing effort moved from classroom&#8209;based training </p>
<p>to mentoring and monitoring at IPS stations, officers would need more flexible travel </p>
<p>arrangements. He recommended that UK police officers should have the option, with </p>
<p>additional training if required, to operate on the same basis as the International Police </p>
<p>Advisers (IPAs). He also suggested supplying UK police officer secondees with enhanced </p>
<p>weapons, also with additional training.</p>

<p>CC Kernaghan visited Iraq from 12 to 17 May 2005 and wrote a report of his findings </p>
<p>on 25 May to Mr Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, and Mr Chris Fox, President of </p>
<p>ACPO.</p>
<p>758</p>
<p> The first part of this visit was spent investigating the role of UK police officers </p>
<p>with Sir Ronnie Flanagan, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, CC Hugh Orde, Chief </p>
<p>Constable of PSNI, and Mr Colin Cramphorn, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. </p>
<p>In his report, CC Kernaghan endorsed the use of armoured vehicles within military </p>
<p>convoys for police officer secondees, but considered enhanced weaponry “a step too far”. </p>
<p>He cautioned against treating police officers who had served in Northern Ireland differently </p>
<p>from those without this background, noting that this “could be interpreted as … placing a </p>
<p>lesser value on their safety and treating them as de facto cannon fodder”.</p>
<p>On 24 October, Major General James Dutton, GOC MND(SE) from June 2005 until </p>
<p>December 2005, wrote that “clarity” in the contractual obligations of UK police officers and </p>
<p>ArmorGroup personnel was needed.</p>
<p>759</p>
<p> In addition:</p>
<p>“…we will need to resolve the issue of movement restrictions on the CivPol and </p>
<p>ArmorGroup personnel. There appear to be different transport restrictions placed </p>
<p>upon civil servants employed by MOD to those working for the FCO and their </p>
<p>contractors, CivPol and ArmorGroup (although there are even differences between </p>
<p>them). The principal problem is that the FCO and their contractors are not permitted </p>
<p>to travel in military vehicles.” </p>
<p>On 11 November, CC Kernaghan emailed a junior official in the Home Office following a </p>
<p>report from DCC Smith that stated Maj Gen Dutton wished to assume control of police and </p>
<p>ArmorGroup assets, and see police personnel travel in Snatch vehicles.</p>
<p>760</p>
<p> Maj Gen Dutton </p>
<p>had reportedly suggested he would review the relevant contracts of employment to enable </p>
<p>the latter. </p>
<p>CC Kernaghan wrote that it was important that the arrangements for police officers were </p>
<p>not considered in isolation from those of other deployed civilians and emphasised his </p>
<p>expectation that he should be consulted on any move to change the command and control </p>
<p>arrangements for deployed police officers, not presented with a “fait accompli”. </p>
<p>Acting Commander Kevin Hurley, Chief Police Adviser in Basra, June 2004 to December </p>
<p>2004, told the Inquiry of the challenges of trying to effect police training and mentoring </p>
<p>while being unable to travel:</p>
<p>“Security conditions made road travel almost impossible … We were all but </p>
<p>ineffective for most of our time. Ultimately … we reached a stage whereby if we could </p>
<p>not get a helicopter ride we did not move.”</p>
<p>761</p>
<p>In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lieutenant General Jonathan Riley, GOC MND(SE) from </p>
<p>November 2004 to June 2005, said that the “chief difficulty” of the FCO rather than the </p>
<p>military leading police work was the restrictions placed on civilian personnel meant that he </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>could not guarantee that the mentoring of police was done “to the depth, to the degree, </p>
<p>to the duration that it had to be”.</p>
<p>762</p>
<p> That meant that he had to “fill that gap using soldiers </p>
<p>and military police so that instead of partnering my military forces with Iraqi military forces </p>
<p>only, which would have been the ideal situation, I also had to partner them closely in many </p>
<p>cases with the Iraqi police to fill that void”.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Riley said that he had discussed that difficulty with colleagues many times but the </p>
<p>rules for civilian personnel were fixed; “So it became a given”.</p>
<p>The arrangements for civilian personnel are described in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>A decline in security</b></p>
<p><b>808. </b> On 18 August 2004, a Current Intelligence Group (CIG) Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“Little is being done in Basra by the security forces to stop a minority of Mahdi Army </p>
<p>militants causing disruption. The police chief is in league with the militants and </p>
<p>elements of the Iraqi police were involved in the kidnapping of the British journalist </p>
<p>[Mr James Brandon, subsequently released – see Section 9.3]. A report suggests </p>
<p>the Amara police chief has agreed not to interfere in the activities of the Mahdi Army </p>
<p>in the city, but this is due to police concern at their own vulnerability rather than </p>
<p>support for al&#8209;Sadr.”</p>
<p>763</p>
<p><b>809. </b> In his letter to Mr Fergusson on 20 August (as detailed earlier in this Section), </p>
<p>Mr Phillipson wrote that the Prime Minister considered “problems with the police chief </p>

<p>764</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>810. </b> The IPU’s paper entitled “Iraq: Next Steps”, produced on 27 August, stated that the </p>

<p>was advised by a junior official that the deployment should be delayed from June to </p>
<p>September because of a decline in security in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>770</p>
<p> An additional factor was </p>
<p>that the type of mentoring they were contracted for would be “of little value until the Iraqi </p>

<p>police mentors operating in various locations across MND(SE).</p>
<p>771</p>
<p> The contract was </p>
<p>due for renewal at the end of November 2004 but it was likely that a proposal for an </p>

<p> The Committee agreed that the ArmorGroup contract </p>
<p>for 68 mentors costing £4.8m should have “specific reporting procedures, including </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>242</p>
<p><b>821. </b> Commenting on how to raise effective forces, Lt Gen Rollo said:</p>
<p>“… the answer to more forces ultimately was more Iraqis, and the real trick was </p>
<p>to raise effective Iraqi forces, and that the way to do that was to take relatively </p>
<p>small numbers and to try to instil into them a sense of loyalty to the state, which </p>
<p>was really quite difficult to achieve … So loyalties were fragile and depended on </p>
<p>human contact.”</p>

<p><b>The Iraqi Navy </b></p>
<p>A US report from the Independent Commission on the ISF, published on 6 September </p>
<p>2007, explained that Iraq’s coastline was very small but strategically significant.</p>
<p>777</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It included the al&#8209;Basra and the Khor al&#8209;Amaya oil terminals (responsible for 90 percent </p>
<p>of Iraq’s revenue) and Iraq’s only deep water port, Umm Qasr. The maritime borders with </p>
<p>Iran and Kuwait were contested and not clearly demarcated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Iraqi Navy reported through the Joint Headquarters to the IMOD.</p>
<p>778</p>
<p>A paper produced by the MOD on 9 December 2009 stated that “the notable UK </p>
<p>contribution” during Phase IV was the development of the New Iraqi Navy, led by the </p>
<p>Royal Navy at Umm Qasr.</p>
<p>779</p>
<p> The Royal Navy also trained the Iraqi Coast Guard, which </p>
<p>operated in close proximity to the Iraqi Navy but reported to the MOI.</p>
<p>780</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 1 February 2005, a junior MOD official advised Mr Hoon that 49 personnel were </p>
<p>deployed in Navy Advisory Support Teams (ASTs), including force protection.</p>
<p>781</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Chief of the Naval Staff visited Iraq in July and observed that recruiting and training of </p>
<p>the Marine force was almost complete and subject to the procurement of suitable support </p>
<p>vessels they should be able to resume responsibility for the security of oil platforms later in </p>
<p>the year.</p>
<p>782</p>
<p> He noted problems with funding but stated: “our AST and the Iraqi Navy have </p>
<p>done well … I am content that we have reached the stage where the AST can start to </p>
<p>draw down provided it is adequately supported by MND(SE)”. </p>
<p>In the same month Lt Gen Brims described the development of the Iraqi Navy as </p>
<p>“a significant UK success”.</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>243</p>
<p>recent assessment of all UK government staff in Iraq had determined that “the prisons </p>
<p>contribution” was vital. Risk assessments were being conducted at military locations to </p>
<p>enable the deployment of prisons mentors to the provinces. Support to the prisons effort </p>
<p>was being maintained by the RMP.</p>
<p><b>823. </b> On 20 January 2005, minutes of the SSR meeting recorded that the prisons </p>
<p>programme had been extended for a further six months and the Prison Service had </p>
<p>confirmed they would provide officers for phase two. A UK criminal justice adviser had </p>
<p>also been deployed.</p>
<p>785</p>
<p><b>824. </b> On 9 August, the IPU submitted an initial bid for the prison programme to receive </p>
<p>funding until 31 March 2006.</p>
<p>786</p>
<p> The bid stated that since it had begun in May 2004, the </p>
<p>programme had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>trained every prison officer in MND(SE); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>established a training school for the Iraqi Correctional Service (ICS); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>developed a corps of Iraqi trainers; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>built and established a new prison in Basra that would “become a model prison </p>
<p>for Iraq”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“substantially improved conditions and treatment of prisoners” in each other </p>
<p>prison in the region. </p>
<p><b>825. </b> The bid was for funding to continue supporting prisons advisers, to help to increase </p>
<p>the capability of the ICS and to complete the ongoing infrastructure projects. </p>
<p><b>826. </b> In describing the effects of the programme, the IPU cited Iraq’s “dreadful human </p>
<p>rights record” in prisons and stated that the first two phases of the programme had </p>
<p>“already dramatically transformed the functioning of the prisons in MND(SE) both by </p>
<p>improving the physical conditions in which prisoners are kept, and changing attitudes </p>
<p>amongst staff”. Continuing work would build on that, particularly in respect of female and </p>
<p>juvenile prisoners. </p>
<p><b>827. </b> On 15 August, Mr Collis sent a telegram to the FCO reporting allegations of </p>
<p>“systematic abuse” at al&#8209;Maqil prison in Basra.</p>
<p>787</p>
<p> The allegations, made by an Iraqi </p>
<p>prison officer, included the sexual abuse of a female prisoner and the payment of bribes </p>
<p>to avoid beatings and facilitate visits by relatives. The prison officer claimed that  </p>
<p>one&#8209;quarter of the prison staff was involved, including at a senior level.</p>
<p><b>828. </b> Mr Stephen Fradley, the British Senior Prison Adviser, had raised the concerns with </p>
<p>the Regional Director of the Iraqi Correctional Service, who subsequently spoke to the </p>
<p>Prison Governor. The Governor said that an investigation had been undertaken and that </p>

<p> Reporting on a meeting between Mr Andrew Hood, Legal Adviser, and </p>
<p>Mr Amin, it stated that Mr Amin was positive about the training prison inspectors had </p>
<p>received and that he would like all this to be available to all inspectors. Speaking to </p>
<p>Mr Hood, Mr Amin requested further assistance: “he had sufficient funds to employ more </p>

<p> The press lines annexed to the document explained that </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi had “made a direct call for assistance to No.10”:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is keen to assist, not least as the speedy Iraqiisation of the </p>
<p>security sector is a key strategic aim of the UK and will ultimately facilitate our own </p>
<p>withdrawal.”</p>
<p><b>835. </b> Between November 2004 and July 2005, equipment was delivered to the ISF in </p>
<p>four tranches through “Project OSIRIS”. Over that period, minutes from MOD officials to </p>
<p>the Defence Secretary detailed what would be provided in each tranche:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tranche one<b> </b>for £15m was approved in early December and focused on items </p>
<p>that could be procured quickly through existing contracts, such as small arms, </p>
<p>ammunition, public order and urban operations equipment as well as seven </p>
<p>infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>793</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tranche two<b> </b>for £3.6m was approved in mid&#8209;December and comprised grenade </p>
<p>launchers, pistols, radios and ammunition. That was to be procured through both </p>
<p>new and existing contracts.</p>
<p>794</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tranche three<b> </b>for £6.2m was approved in late January and consisted of three </p>
<p>batches of equipment covering protective vehicles, search equipment for DBE </p>
<p>and machine guns.</p>
<p>795</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Approval for tranche four<b> </b>covering the remaining £15.6m was not sought until </p>
<p>18 July “because of the need to align expenditure plans with the planning </p>
<p>for operational transition” and “changing US expenditure plans”. It included </p>
<p>infrastructure projects, vehicles and communications equipment.</p>
<p>796</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Parliamentary approval was sought for the first three tranches but the obligation to </p>
<p>give Parliament 14 days to raise any objections to gifting</p>
<p>797</p>
<p> the items was reduced to two </p>
<p>days with Treasury approval. Tranche four was approved by the Chairman of the Public </p>

<p>246</p>
<p><b>837. </b> On 18 July, a junior MOD official wrote to Dr Reid, stating that the Chairman of the </p>
<p>PAC had “expressed dissatisfaction with the shortcuts we took to gaining parliamentary </p>
<p>approval” for the first three tranches and that “a couple of backbench MPs” had </p>
<p>objected.</p>
<p>798</p>
<p> The official considered the final tranche “less likely” to generate objections </p>
<p>because it did “not contain any weapons” but:</p>
<p>“We will need to explain why we have again been unable to allow Parliament to </p>
<p>consider this gifting as fully as some MPs might wish.”</p>
<p><b>838. </b> The official wrote that an additional £58m was likely to be needed for the year </p>
<p>ahead: £38m for OSIRIS II (protected and other mobility, infrastructure construction </p>
<p>for forces training, communications, logistics and command and control functions) and </p>
<p>£20m for a Civil Effects Fund. He recommended that Dr Reid propose that expenditure </p>
<p>to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, now Mr Des Browne. He also noted that Project </p>
<p>OSIRIS had “been an understated success story” that should be highlighted in the </p>
<p>presentation plan for operational transition.</p>

<p>800</p>
<p> AM Torpy stated that the training, mentoring and </p>
<p>monitoring of the NIA and ING was one of three emerging tasks from the review. All three </p>
<p>tasks were discretionary for the UK but not for MNF&#8209;I and if other Troop Contributing </p>
<p>Nations did not undertake them, they could fall to the UK.</p>
<p>AM Torpy wrote that the new tasks could be conducted by a battalion plus senior mentors, </p>
<p>“possibly of one&#8209;star rank”, and work was under way to confirm the requirement. He had </p>
<p>agreed with Lt Gen Rollo that the work should be delayed until after the election. AM </p>
<p>Torpy advised that “for force generation purposes we should assume that this is a new – </p>
<p>potentially enduring” task. </p>
<p>Mr Roger Cornish, MOD Deputy Director Iraq, wrote to Mr Hoon about the review on </p>
<p>19 November.</p>

<p>249</p>
<p><b>849. </b> On 11 February, AM Torpy produced a paper on SSR for Gen Walker ahead of the </p>
<p>latter’s visit to Washington on 15 February.</p>
<p>814</p>
<p> In the paper, AM Torpy outlined two options </p>
<p>being considered to support MNF&#8209;I’s focus on assistance teams:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Full support (“the MNF&#8209;I default”): MATs placed with every ISF unit in MND(SE) </p>
<p>(excluding the police), and at training schools, requiring 324 personnel.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Targeted support: “continuation of current partnering arrangements with ISF </p>
<p>units” targeted at “areas of weakness, such as formation headquarters, training </p>
<p>schools and logistic bases”, requiring 110 personnel. MATs would not be </p>
<p>involved with the Public Order Battalions or the DBE units. </p>
<p><b>850. </b> AM Torpy wrote that the UK’s emphasis had been on “partnering” and there </p>
<p>were currently no UK personnel embedded within Iraqi units. In introducing the options, </p>
<p>he stated:</p>
<p>“Given MOD guidance to avoid a significant increase in commitment, our scope </p>
<p>to implement this SSR strategy will be constrained by our ability to free up and </p>
<p>refocus manpower.”</p>
<p><b>851. </b> The resource implications of both options were to be assessed by a US Joint Force </p>
<p>Headquarter team deploying to Iraq the following week. It was anticipated that “coalition </p>
<p>partners” would offer “significant contributions” once briefed by the US at a Bucharest </p>
<p>Conference in February. That briefing would also “provide further clarity, thereby allowing </p>
<p>the UK to refine its potential contribution”.</p>
<p><b>852. </b> AM Torpy visited Iraq from 13 to 19 February.</p>
<p>815</p>
<p> He reported: </p>
<p>“[Gen] Casey is entirely comfortable with the UK’s approach in MND(SE); indeed, he </p>
<p>has told his commanders to visit MND(SE) to see how we handle the task.”</p>
<p><b>853. </b> Major General Peter Wall, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations, attended the </p>
<p>CENTCOM conference on 28 February. He reported that the US approach to embed </p>
<p>trainers at division, brigade and battalion level (and also with Special Police and Border </p>
<p>Enforcement units) would have “implications” for the UK’s “current policy”.</p>
<p>816</p>
<p> He would </p>
<p>discuss with Maj Gen Houghton and Mr Howard.</p>
<p><b>854. </b> On 11 March, AM Torpy produced a paper for the Chiefs of Staff on delivering SSR </p>
<p>in MND(SE).</p>
<p>817</p>
<p> There was no specific reference to his 11 February paper, but the plan </p>
<p>he set out for MTTs</p>
<p>818</p>
<p> was consistent with the “Targeted Support” option proposed in that </p>
<p>earlier paper. </p>

<p><b>855. </b> The Chiefs discussed AM Torpy’s SSR paper on 16 March.</p>
<p>819</p>
<p> The minutes record:</p>
<p>“The continuous burden of manning MTTs and STTTs [Short Term Training Teams], </p>
<p>and its potential impact on the requirement for augmentees was highlighted. </p>
<p>DCJO(Ops) [Maj Gen Wall] indicated that the majority of posts would be filled from </p>
<p>current force levels and that the requirement for UK augmentees was not expected </p>
<p>to exceed 20.”</p>
<p><b>856. </b> On 17 March, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to No.10 to provide an update </p>
<p>on SSR progress.</p>
<p>820</p>
<p> On the creation of MTTs he stated:</p>
<p>“MNF&#8209;I plan to have Military Transition Teams (MTTs) established across Iraq and </p>
<p>working with Iraqi units by June. In MND(SE) we expect to have MTTs established </p>
<p>by May. The MTTs will train and mentor their affiliated Iraqi units, remaining with </p>
<p>them both in barracks and on security duties. In MND(SE) the MTT organisation will </p>
<p>be developed from the existing partnership arrangements between coalition and ISF </p>
<p>units, which first highlighted the benefits of this approach.”</p>
<p><b>857. </b> The MOD’s Directorate of Operational Capability considered the differing </p>
<p>approaches to mentoring the ISF undertaken by the UK and US militaries in 2010.</p>
<p>821</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It commented: </p>
<p>“The UK and US approaches were fundamentally at odds; this was identified by </p>
<p>those in theatre at the time and reported back … The decision not to embed mentors </p>
<p>… may seem perplexing, particularly considering UK troops in Afghanistan were </p>
<p>embedding in this manner at that time … </p>
<p>“We have pondered the reasons for this approach, without reaching an entirely </p>
<p>satisfactory conclusion. During interview a number of people have suggested that </p>
<p>this very different approach to embedding mentors between two UK theatres of </p>
<p>operation, as well as the difference between the UK and US approaches in Iraq, </p>
<p>was that senior politicians (or perhaps military leaders) in the UK were risk&#8209;, and </p>
<p>in particular, casualty&#8209;averse. Whether this is true, and if so whether it can be </p>
<p>seen as a result of the different way in which the two theatres were viewed by the </p>
<p>British public – Iraq as an unpopular “war of choice”, with Afghanistan a “war of </p>
<p>necessity” – is unclear. What is certain is that, at the time, the total number and rate </p>
<p>of casualties being experienced in Afghanistan were both far lower than had been </p>
<p>suffered in Iraq. We might reasonably conclude that this would have had an effect </p>
<p>on the political&#8209;military discussions and decisions regarding embedding and force </p>
<p>protection. This seems especially likely as the focus in Iraq became predominantly </p>
<p>on reducing troop numbers in order to hand over to the Iraqi Security Forces, </p>
<p>allowing the UK forces to withdraw and focus on [Afghanistan].”</p>

<p>251</p>
<p><b>The US approach to Transition Teams </b></p>
<p>A Report to Congress on 29 August 2006 stated that “more than 160” Police Transition </p>
<p>Teams (PTTs) were helping to develop the IPS.</p>
<p>822</p>
<p> International Police Liaison Officers </p>
<p>(IPLOs) were integrated into PTTs, providing expertise in all technical aspects of criminal </p>
<p>investigation and police station management. The Report stated that an additional five </p>
<p>(US) Military Police companies were deployed in July 2006 to bolster the PTT programme. </p>
<p>The next Report on 30 November stated there were 177 PTTs, each team with </p>
<p>11&#8209;15 members: three or four IPLOs, hired as contractors from US State Department and </p>
<p>the rest typically military personnel (often Military Police).</p>
<p>823</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Report to Congress on 2 March 2007 stated that there were a total of around </p>
<p>6,000 international advisers in more than 450 Transition Teams.</p>
<p>824</p>
<p> The Transition Teams </p>
<p>were established in the following proportions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>200 Police Transition Teams;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>40 National Police Transition Teams;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>30 Border Transition Teams;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>170 Military Transition Teams; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Transition Teams in various ministries and command establishments including </p>
<p>the MOI, IMOD and the JHQ.</p>
<p>825</p>
<p>Even with the extra personnel, shortages of PTTs were limiting observation of the IPS in </p>
<p>13 of the 18 provinces, including Basra and Maysan.</p>
<p>826</p>
<p> The DoD’s Report to Congress in </p>
<p>March 2007 cited cost and risk to personnel as the reasons for limited coverage.</p>
<p>827</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Concerns about strategy</b></p>
<p><b>858. </b> In his weekly update on 2 February 2005, Maj Gen Riley wrote:</p>
<p>“IPS reform is a problem wider and deeper than the Army, and the incoming Chief </p>
<p>Police Adviser will be key to turning them into an effective counter insurgency force </p>
<p>… there is a proposal to send the new Chief Police Adviser to Baghdad instead of </p>
<p>here … I would advise against this in the strongest possible terms: this will lead to </p>
<p>a delay of months (probably) in police reform here, months that we do not need. UK </p>
<p>can have the greatest effect here on the ground …”</p>
<p>828</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>859. </b> On 17 March, Lt Gen Fry produced a paper for the Chiefs of Staff examining </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>were briefed that the eventual move to provincial control would be based on “complex, </p>
<p>inter&#8209;dependent conditions” that were not fully defined and would depend upon the </p>
<p>development of a national security framework and that, although military SSR activity </p>
<p>in MND(SE) was progressing well, the scope for significant military disengagement </p>
<p>in 2005 would be limited. Military SSR was expected to be completed in MND(SE) in </p>
<p>March 2006. </p>
<p><b>860. </b> Lt Gen Fry highlighted that non&#8209;military Iraqi capabilities, especially the IPS, were </p>
<p>lagging behind the Iraqi Army and stated:</p>
<p>“This imbalance must be redressed not only to ward against an overly dominant </p>
<p>IA [Iraqi Army], but also to allow us to realise the potential military dividend of our </p>
<p>efforts with the IA.”</p>
<p><b>861. </b> Lt Gen Fry suggested that the UK needed to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>influence the development of a national policing strategy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage greater international involvement, particularly for gendarmerie&#8209;type </p>
<p>training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>develop IPS leadership and niche capabilities; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>develop an effective judiciary and prison system to support IPS activity.</p>
<p><b>862. </b> Lt Gen Fry stated that the FCO was planning to address some of those shortfalls </p>
<p>but that those plans required “significant extra funding and depend largely on the </p>
<p>availability of suitable senior UK policemen”. MOD activity to support IPS development </p>
<p>at that stage comprised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>basic skills training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training of TSUs (to focus on public order, dangerous criminality and low level </p>
<p>insurgent action); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of military officers to support planning and co&#8209;ordination at the </p>
<p>Provincial Joint Operations Centres (PJOCs).</p>
<p><b>863. </b> Lt Gen Fry identified three risks to ISF development in MND(SE) progressing </p>
<p>ahead of national development:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISF in MND(SE) would not mesh into national Iraqi security structures.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISF would become autonomous and “prone to tribal, political and </p>
<p>confessional influences rather than national control”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There may be a lack of national logistical, equipment, procurement and </p>
<p>maintenance structures for them to access.</p>
<p><b>864. </b> Lt Gen Fry suggested that those risks could be mitigated, to some extent, by UK </p>
<p>advisers in Iraq’s security Ministries seeking to accelerate the development on coherent </p>
<p>national policies and structures and that where possible the UK “should seek to achieve </p>
<p>a demonstrable vanguard effect by spreading UK ‘best practice’ in the development of </p>
<p>ISF to other areas in Iraq”.</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>253</p>
<p><b>865. </b> On 24 March, Dr Roger Hutton, MOD Director Joint Commitments, provided an </p>
<p>update to Mr Hoon on discussion of Lt Gen Fry’s paper by the Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>830</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>update gave further detail on how the UK military would support that new approach in </p>
<p>MND(SE), to include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of MTTs at divisional and brigade level (there were four Iraqi Army </p>
<p>brigades in MND(SE); it was envisaged that the UK would provide MTTs for </p>
<p>two of them and the Australians and Italians would provide one MTT each for the </p>
<p>other two brigades);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>two Short Term Training Team deployments, one in June and one in December </p>
<p>to look at the effectiveness of training; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued “partnership” with the UK brigade partnering the divisional </p>
<p>headquarters of 10th Division and a coalition battlegroup working with each </p>
<p>of the four brigades in the 10th Division.</p>
<p><b>866. </b> Dr Hutton advised that there would be a requirement of only 25 extra troops </p>
<p>to implement this approach.</p>
<p><b>10th Division </b></p>
<p>The 10th Division was the Iraqi Army division in MND(SE) that had been trained by UK </p>
<p>personnel. It was established by Maj Gen Riley as reported in his update on Southern Iraq </p>
<p>on 12 January 2005. He wrote that he had established the 10th Division alongside HQ </p>
<p>MND(SE) at the Basra Air Station.</p>
<p>831</p>
<p><b>867. </b> Gen Jackson visited Iraq from 17 to 20 April 2005.</p>
<p>832</p>
<p> On his return he reported:</p>
<p>“… military SSR continues to progress well and the provision of Military Transition </p>
<p>Teams (MiTTs) should provide a qualitative boost to ISF performance … Overall, </p>
<p>GOC MND(SE) remains confident that his military SSR efforts will be complete </p>
<p>in Maysan and Al Muthanna circa October 2005; and in Basra and Dhi Qar circa </p>
<p>March 2006.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>868. </b> On the IPS, Gen Jackson wrote:</p>
<p>“In contrast to the satisfactory progress with the development of the Iraqi Army, the </p>
<p>lack of discernable progress with the IPS is alarming … It could become our Achilles </p>
<p>heel because without an effective IPS, not to mention a criminal justice system – </p>
<p>there can be no Rule of Law, a pre&#8209;requisite for our eventual military disengagement. </p>
<p>The scale and quality of International Police Adviser effort is woeful and the arrival of </p>
<p>the new Senior Police Adviser has failed to re&#8209;invigorate IPS development. Although </p>
<p>theoretically the military is acting in support of the IPA, we find ourselves de facto </p>

<p><b>Restructuring SSR</b></p>
<p><b>869. </b> Mr Stuart Innes, British Consul General Basra, sent an eGram on 3 May 2005 </p>
<p>reporting a meeting he had held with Maj Gen Riley and DCC Smith a day earlier.</p>
<p>833</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Innes stated that Maj Gen Riley had “said that SSR was now the main focus of the </p>
<p>UK’s military efforts in MND(SE)” and that the IPS programme required greater attention </p>
<p>if responsibility for security was to be handed to the ISF by October.</p>
<p><b>870. </b> On 5 May 2005, Maj Gen Wall wrote to Lt Gen Fry about the 2 May meeting, </p>
<p>stating that the FCO’s eGram provided “a partial explanation of the proposed way </p>
<p>ahead” which was “open to misinterpretation”.</p>
<p>834</p>
<p> On the increase of military support </p>
<p>he wrote:</p>
<p>“The lead for police reform remains with the FCO. The military continue to fulfil a </p>
<p>supporting and co&#8209;ordination role with greater planning responsibility.</p>
<p>“No additional UK military resources are required, and none will be ‘fixed’ if there </p>
<p>is an opportunity to reduce force levels … Nor does it require resources being </p>
<p>redirected from existing tasks.</p>
<p>“Military assistance to the Iraqi Army will remain the Division’s main effort; support </p>
<p>to the IPS is a lower priority.” </p>
<p><b>871. </b> DCC Smith became the UK Chief Police Adviser in Iraq in May 2005, a role that </p>
<p>combined the two previous Senior Police Adviser positions in Baghdad and Basra. He </p>
<p>told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… part of my remit to go to Baghdad was to increase UK influence at a strategic </p>

<p>Superintendent; one based in Baghdad, the other in Basra. The team in Baghdad was </p>
<p>also strengthened from around 10 to just under 20. </p>
<p><b>873. </b> The review included a 12&#8209;month policing strategy, which DCC Smith identified as a </p>
<p>priority for the three provinces to implement. DCC Smith wrote that it had received wide </p>
<p>circulation and consultation “with all stakeholders” and particularly with Iraqi Chiefs of </p>
<p>Police. The paper stated:</p>
<p>“It will concentrate on areas that have ‘Iraqi buy in’, are achievable within 12 months </p>
<p>and importantly, sustainable (by the Iraqis) beyond 12 months.”</p>
<p><b>874. </b> He described the operational implementation priorities in MND(SE) as focusing </p>
<p>on two key areas: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>implementation of the “12 month IPS Development Strategy and Plan”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further strengthening the Regional Police Training Academy at az&#8209;Zubayr to </p>
<p>enable it to train the Iraqi trainers who would, in due course, be responsible for </p>
<p>police training.</p>
<p><b>875. </b> DCC Smith stated that Gen Petraeus had taken the decision to put the 20 CPATT </p>
<p>International Police Liaison Officers in MND(SE) under the command of Maj Gen Riley, </p>
<p>a move which DCC Smith described as:</p>
<p>“… at best misguided and at worst a major difficulty. GOC MND(SE) now has his </p>
<p>own private US Police Advisers!! It is clear that at the senior level in Baghdad the US </p>
<p>Authorities have not been made aware that we have done things more professionally </p>
<p>in MND(SE) with senior serving CivPol Officers leading on IPS Development.”</p>
<p><b>876. </b> DCC Smith stressed the importance of extending the ArmorGroup contract, noting </p>
<p>that police officers “cannot meet the major priorities without ArmorGroup support”. He </p>
<p>identified a number of other opportunities to increase available resources, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seeking input from the Commonwealth and EU; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identifying police officers currently serving in the Territorial Army in MND(SE) </p>
<p>and attaching them to joint military/police teams; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>better recruitment of recently retired police officers, particularly from Northern </p>
<p>Ireland. </p>
<p><b>877. </b> DCC Smith concluded:</p>
<p>“We have failed in the past through lack of appropriate succession planning … </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>878. </b> CC Kernaghan’s visit report on 25 May stated:</p>
<p>“… progress has been made in training Iraqi Police Service personnel. However, </p>
<p>with the exception of groups such as the Tactical Support Unit they remain of </p>
<p>questionable quality. The initial concept of creating a community policing force </p>
<p>on the classic Anglo&#8209;American model appears to have been overtaken by a more </p>
<p>realistic recognition, that first and foremost a police force must be effective if it is </p>
<p>to secure public support. Thus in the face of an insurgency, it is essential that the </p>
<p>force can defend itself and its police stations. This has improved but philosophical </p>
<p>confusion still appears to bedevil the project … I am still of the view that there is a </p>
<p>disconnect between CPATT [Baghdad] and the British led effort within MND(SE).”</p>
<p>837</p>
<p><b>Should the UK focus be on Baghdad or the South?</b></p>
<p>On 4 July 2005, the record of the Iraq Senior Officials Group stated: </p>
<p>“The work of our international policing adviser in Baghdad was being hampered by </p>
<p>the scale of the US presence and the difficulty of securing buy&#8209;in from the Minister </p>
<p>of the Interior. An emerging conclusion was that we should concentrate our effort on </p>
<p>MND(SE), moving our adviser there and away from the national policing strategy. </p>
<p>This would be consonant with our broader policy, but could risk sending the signal </p>
<p>that we were concerned only with the South&#8209;East.”</p>
<p>838 </p>
<p><b>879. </b> On 19 May, Dr Reid briefed Cabinet that he had “been encouraged” by the </p>
<p>progress in building up the ISF and that he hoped it would be possible for the ISF to </p>
<p>take over from UK forces in MND(SE) in “the course of the next year”.</p>
<p>839</p>
<p> He stated that </p>
<p>progress with the Iraqi police was “less advanced” and that the border forces were the </p>

<p><b>Raising concerns with the Iraqis</b></p>
<p><b>882. </b> On 28 April 2005, a junior IPU official sent a note to Mr Asquith and Baroness </p>
<p>Symons highlighting serious concerns about the links between the Iraqi police and </p>
<p>the Shia militia, particularly in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>842</p>
<p> There was an increasing picture of </p>
<p>“systematic collusion between the Basra Police Intelligence Unit (within the IPS) and </p>
<p>Shiite militias to interrogate, torture and murder Sunni prisoners, particularly suspected </p>
<p>Ba’athists”. Specifically, the Police Intelligence Unit (PIU)</p>
<p>843</p>
<p> based at the Jameat </p>

<p>Mr Abbas Allawi.</p>

<p><b>884. </b> The advice said that the “Iraqis have promised action”. The Basra Governor </p>
<p>had agreed to establish an investigation committee following “strong pressure” from </p>
<p>Mr Chaplin and Mr Innes. It was not clear whether the Governor and Maj Gen Hassan </p>
<p>were willing to prosecute any officers if found guilty. The official added:</p>
<p>“It is even less clear that they will take firm action on the wider issues of abuse </p>
<p>that appear to be inherent in some Iraqi police detention facilities, notably that of </p>
<p>the PIU.”</p>
<p><b>885. </b> Dr Howells’ Assistant Private Secretary responded to IPU on 19 May.</p>
<p>845</p>
<p> He agreed </p>
<p>the recommendation and asked for “firm, decisive and urgent action”. He also requested </p>
<p>that IPU raise the issue with the US administration (to “exert pressure on the Iraqis”), </p>
<p>and brief Ms Clwyd (to raise it “at a senior level on her visit to Iraq next week”).</p>
<p><b>886. </b> Dr Howells subsequently visited Baghdad from 13 to 15 September. He met </p>
<p>Mr Jabr and raised concerns about human rights abuses by the ISF, pressing for </p>

<p>846</p>
<p> Mr Patey handed Mr Jabr a dossier on three members </p>

<p>847</p>
<p> Maj Gen Hassan was “pushed very firmly” to take action </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>890. </b> Major General James Dutton was GOC MND(SE) from June 2005 until December </p>
<p>2005. In his first report on 15 June he noted:</p>
<p>“… political pressure to clean up the Police Intelligence Unit (PIU) in Basra is </p>
<p>having some impact. For example, moves seem to be afoot to reform practices in </p>
<p>the Jameat [the police station where the PIU was based] through a new overseeing </p>
<p>judge and a new head of internal affairs. We also hear rumours that the PIU may </p>
<p>be subsumed into a larger MOI intelligence organisation.”</p>
<p>850</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>891. </b> A junior official in Baghdad emailed the IPU on 14 June to report that Mr Patey </p>
<p>had met Mr Jabr that day and raised Mr Abbas Allawi’s case.</p>
<p>851</p>
<p> He had “stressed that </p>
<p>support from the top was needed to ensure that there was meaningful investigation – it </p>
<p>was necessary to embolden General Hassan”. Mr Jabr was supportive of action being </p>
<p>taken against the suspects and had established the investigation commission but </p>
<p>pointed out that it was the British who had chosen the police in the South.</p>
<p><b>892. </b> Mr Fraser Wheeler, Deputy Consul General in Basra, emailed FCO officials on </p>
<p>15 June to report a mix&#8209;up over who was the investigating judge on Mr Abbas Allawi’s </p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>852</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“I do not put this down to incompetence (though there is clearly some of that too) </p>
<p>but to deliberate obfuscation. We are being passed from pillar to post, and the Allawi </p>
<p>case is not receiving the treatment and attention a case of this nature deserves.”</p>
<p><b>893. </b> On 16 June, Mr Wheeler and the Justice Sector Adviser met a senior judge in </p>
<p>Basra to discuss Mr Abbas Allawi’s case.</p>
<p>853</p>
<p> In his record of the meeting, Mr Wheeler </p>
<p>reported that the case had been passed between four judges so far. It was important </p>
<p>that a police station without Jameat links conduct the investigation, but the branch had </p>
<p>officers in many stations. The Basra Judicial Committee would appoint an investigating </p>
<p>judge on 19 June. </p>
<p><b>894. </b> Mr Wheeler wrote that, although there had been an autopsy and arrest warrants </p>
<p>had been issued for four suspects, none had been arrested because “no&#8209;one dare arrest </p>
<p>them”. The judge had “commented that the judiciary is not afraid but is hampered by a </p>
<p>lack of support from the police who do not effect judicial orders”. Mr Wheeler wrote that </p>
<p>this was “hard to accept” given the reluctance to deal with the case.</p>
<p><b>895. </b> An email from a junior official in IPU on 17 June reported that General Hassan </p>
<p>had “been fired”.</p>
<p>854</p>
<p> There was concern over the impact that could have on progressing </p>
<p>Mr Abbas Allawi’s case and that those responsible may view General Hassan’s removal </p>
<p>as “proof that they are untouchable”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>896. </b> Mr Straw raised the issue with Mr Jabr in the margins of the Iraq Conference </p>
<p>in Brussels on 22 June.</p>
<p>855</p>
<p> Mr Jabr agreed with the importance of investigating the </p>
<p>case and said that a team had already travelled to Basra to do so. He said that “the </p>
<p>problem was that the policemen responsible had been appointed well before he </p>
<p>assumed office”.</p>
<p><b>897. </b> On 4 July, Mr Innes emailed Mr Paul Fox, Head of IPU, to report that the PIU had </p>
<p>been disbanded and the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) purged. Around 290 of </p>
<p>the 560 officers from the PIU and the DIA had been transferred to the new Criminal </p>
<p>Intelligence Unit (CIU), a unit established a few weeks earlier as part of an MOI project </p>
<p>to establish an “FBI style organisation” with branches around the country. </p>
<p><b>898. </b> Mr Innes raised further concerns that the former head of the DIA, who had been </p>
<p>sacked in January, had been appointed by the MOI to command the CIU.</p>
<p>856</p>
<p> Mr Innes </p>
<p>summarised:</p>
<p>“So, where does all that leave us? I think we can take a good deal of credit for </p>
<p>provoking the dismemberment of the PIU and the DIA. The old rings have been </p>
<p>broken, and the practice of systemic abuse has been disrupted. There has been a </p>
<p>real shake&#8209;up in personnel and command. According to intelligence and eye&#8209;witness </p>
<p>reports, the Jameat has indeed turned over a new leaf … The fact remains however </p>
<p>that bad men are still at large; of the three officers we named in our earlier lobbying </p>
<p>of MOI, two are now in the new CIU and the third … is still in the DIA. We will </p>
<p>continue to urge their arrest, investigation, and prosecution – though we need </p>
<p>to accept that the political and tribal constraints on this actually happening are </p>
<p>considerable. Their sacking from the IPS would at least send an important signal, </p>
<p>and we may have to settle for that.” </p>
<p><b>899. </b> On 17 July, DCC Smith reported that the PIU’s closure had left 100 incomplete </p>
<p>cases that were now being reviewed by the Serious Crimes Unit (SCU).</p>
<p>857</p>
<p> There was </p>
<p>also the release of a number of detainees because there was “no evidence against them </p>
<p>in the case files”. A Ministry of Health team had visited the Jameat on 13 July to carry </p>
<p>out medical checks on all detainees and a routine of daily visits had been put in place. </p>
<p><b>900. </b> DCC Smith wrote that details about the CIU’s structure were “conflicting” but </p>
<p>it appeared to have “approximately 350 staff”. It was directed from Baghdad to act </p>
<p>as an intelligence&#8209;gathering agency without powers to make arrests, though DCC </p>
<p>Smith observed that this direction was unlikely to be followed. He commented that </p>
<p>“the Governor and Chief of Police currently refuse to work with the CIU and their </p>
<p>remit and responsibilities are unclear”. A former head of the CIU had made “currently </p>
<p>unsubstantiated allegations” that the CIU was being funded by officers taking </p>

<p><b>901. </b> On Mr Abbas Allawi’s case, DCC Smith reported that a second meeting of the </p>
<p>investigation team had been held and one of the suspects had been arrested. Two new </p>
<p>suspects had been identified but it was “unlikely” they would be arrested without MOI </p>
<p>support because of the “instability” it would cause. A representative from the UN would </p>
<p>be taking the matter to the Minister for Human Rights and Baghdad to “add more </p>

<p><b>902. </b> Mr Fox visited Iraq from 17 to 21 July.</p>
<p>858</p>
<p> He reported that progress was being </p>

<p><b>903. </b> When in Basra, Mr Fox had requested details from personnel on achievements </p>
<p>against the 12&#8209;month plan and on the next steps. Mr Fox’s report made no mention of </p>
<p>concern about corruption, infiltration or abuse.</p>
<p><b>904. </b> Mr Fox described the GCPP&#8209;funded prisons project in MND(SE), where eight UK </p>
<p>trainers had trained 250 prison staff, as having “established an independent detention </p>
<p>monitoring team” and worked closely with the US “to spread best practice elsewhere” </p>
<p>as a “good example of a small&#8209;scale, low cost (£1.9m) project delivering outcomes far </p>

<p><b>905. </b> On 22 July, a junior IPU official briefed Dr Howells that reports suggested that </p>

<p>859</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>906. </b> The official wrote that Mr Abbas Allawi’s case had “shown that our policy of </p>
<p>engagement and strong lobbying can work” and “the alternative &#8209; to disengage and cease </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation – would only give abusers a free rein to continue abuse unmonitored”.</p>
<p><b>907. </b> The official advised that the UK should continue to lobby both in Iraq and </p>
<p>internationally, should ensure that abuse was on the agenda at weekly meetings in </p>
<p>Baghdad, and should push for a strong Iraqi Human Rights Minister. He also stated that </p>
<p>there was a need to increase police human rights awareness to overcome an “inherited </p>
<p>ethos of abuse and stifle any tendency towards sectarian victimisation”. UK forces had </p>
<p>reviewed their procedures for transferring detainees to Iraqi custody and were in the </p>
<p>process of introducing further guidance on protecting detainees’ human rights but there </p>
<p>was no specific evidence that the police with whom MNF&#8209;I in MND(SE) engaged were </p>
<p>abusing detainees.</p>

<p>262</p>
<p><b>908. </b> On 29 July, a junior official from the MOD submitted a similar briefing to the Private </p>
<p>Office of a Parliamentary Under Secretary for Defence.</p>
<p>860</p>
<p> The official wrote:</p>
<p>“It has become increasingly clear … that abuse in the Iraqi Security Forces may be </p>
<p>far more widespread than the specific incidents of which we are aware suggest, with </p>
<p>reports now beginning to reach the media. This raises two issues: what should be </p>
<p>done to address human rights abuses in Iraq – FCO are leading on this area; and </p>
<p>the nature of our wider involvement with the IPS?”</p>
<p><b>909. </b> The official described work under way on tackling abuse and added:</p>
<p>“Although instances of abuse by the IPS are ultimately a matter for the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, our involvement in the training of the IPS … means that we may be </p>
<p>judged by the media and others to be culpable. Legally, we may also be at risk if our </p>
<p>involvement could be judged as directly assisting units that systematically torture </p>
<p>detainees.”</p>
<p><b>910. </b> In his weekly report on 28 August, DCC Smith highlighted that the CIU’s name was </p>
<p>likely to be changed to the National Information and Investigation Agency: “The Iraqis </p>
<p>are not ‘keen’ on either ‘intelligence’ or ‘criminal’ in the name.”</p>
<p>861</p>
<p> He wrote that a number </p>
<p>of officers previously involved in corrupt or criminal behaviour remained members of </p>
<p>the CIU and that the unit’s training could not begin until they were removed by the MOI. </p>
<p>There had been no progress in investigating Mr Abbas Allawi’s case. </p>
<p><b>Continued plans for a UK troop drawdown</b></p>
<p>On 16 June 2005, Dr Reid advised his colleagues in DOP(I) that: </p>
<p>“… considerable progress had been made on the development of the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces. 165,000 were now trained. There could be a drawdown in British troop </p>
<p>numbers starting at the beginning of 2006 … culminating in the middle of that year.”</p>
<p>862</p>
<p>On 20 July, Dr Reid presented a paper to DOP(I) on transition in Iraq.</p>
<p>863</p>
<p> The paper </p>
<p>suggested that handover in Maysan and Muthanna would occur from March 2006, with </p>
<p>Basra slightly later in July 2006 (no specific date was given for Dhi Qar). “Handover” </p>
<p>would see Iraqis assuming security control of their province. The paper described the </p>
<p>ISF in MND(SE) as “fragile and untested” but made no reference to issues of loyalty, </p>
<p>corruption or abuse by ISF personnel. The failure to deliver an effective ISF and wider </p>
<p>criminal justice capability was seen as one of two key risks to transition (the other being a </p>
<p>deterioration in the security situation). </p>
<p>DOP(I) agreed Dr Reid’s proposed approach on 21 July.</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>

<p><b>UK equipment for the Iraqi Security Forces: Project OSIRIS II</b></p>
<p><b>911. </b> In Dr Hutton’s update to Mr Hoon of 24 March (described earlier in this Section), </p>
<p>Dr Hutton warned of risks that other aspects of SSR were lagging behind the Iraqi Army </p>
<p>and of a requirement for further funding since there were “constraints on GCPP funding </p>
<p>for existing policing projects beyond the next six months, and no identified resources for </p>
<p>additional policing effort”.</p>
<p>865</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>912. </b> Dr Hutton advised that SSR required the “sufficient and appropriate investment </p>
<p>of UK financial resources”. Work was under way to develop a coherent plan for the </p>
<p>financial year 2005/06 which would form the basis of a request to Treasury for support </p>
<p>from the Reserve. The plan was to be aligned with other government departments and </p>
<p>sources of funding from others, including the US.</p>
<p><b>913. </b> On 29 April, a Force Level Review by the MOD recommended an increase of </p>
<p>535 personnel to “resource properly the Security Sector Reform (SSR) task” which </p>
<p>was where the “main effort” lay.</p>
<p>866</p>
<p> Of the 27 military sub&#8209;units (each of around 100 </p>
<p>personnel) that would be in MND(SE) following the troop rotation, only four were to be </p>
<p>fully dedicated to SSR and a further 12 available would provide some input when their </p>
<p>primary tasks allowed.</p>
<p><b>914. </b> On 15 June, an official in PJHQ wrote to Dr Reid to highlight ongoing discussions </p>
<p>with Treasury for an additional £38m</p>
<p>867</p>
<p> to fund a successor programme to Project </p>
<p>OSIRIS.</p>
<p>868</p>
<p> The bulk of expenditure would be spent on mobility and the remainder on ISF </p>
<p>training infrastructure, communications, logistics and command and control functions. </p>
<p>The Treasury had taken “a close interest” and was keen to ensure that there was “no </p>
<p>duplication” with funding allocated to the FCO and DFID.</p>
<p><b>915. </b> The official in PJHQ wrote that Project OSIRIS had been “a success”. The </p>
<p>10th Division could “deploy battalions with all four of their rifle companies correctly </p>
<p>armed and equipped” and had improved communications equipment. The IPS, who </p>
<p>“bear the brunt of the violence in the region”, were correctly armed, wore body armour </p>
<p>and were able to communicate at a local level when on duty. The border police were </p>
<p>also armed correctly and had basic communications equipment.</p>
<p><b>916. </b> Dr Reid responded on 23 June, acknowledging that expenditure on SSR and </p>
<p>military&#8209;led reconstruction had been judged as a success and confirming that he was </p>
<p>content for negotiations with the Treasury for the additional funding to be pursued.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>917. </b> Mr Des Browne, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, wrote to Dr Reid on </p>
<p>23 August, approving £16m from the Reserve for the package of vehicles, infrastructure </p>
<p>and communications equipment that had been presented by MOD officials.</p>
<p>870</p>
<p> Of the </p>
<p>future, he wrote:</p>
<p>“Looking ahead, I hope that it will be possible for you to find other means of funding </p>
<p>the remaining elements – either by negotiating with Baghdad, for a larger share of </p>
<p>what is available (it is striking that MND(SE) provinces are right at the bottom of the </p>
<p>priority list for ISF funding from Baghdad despite being among the best candidates </p>
<p>for early transition to ISF control), or by encouraging our allies – most of whom </p>
<p>are spending far less than we are in maintaining forces on the ground – to play a </p>
<p>bigger role.” </p>
<p><b>918. </b> On 30 November, Dr Reid wrote to Mr Browne again, explaining that the MOD </p>
<p>had secured funding from MNSTC&#8209;I for infrastructure projects valued at £15m and from </p>
<p>Australia, Italy and Japan for other projects.</p>
<p>871</p>
<p> The MOD reduced its request to £19.6m </p>
<p>for 734 IPS vehicles and for 11 ISF infrastructure projects. Dr Reid stated that the </p>
<p>additional funds he was seeking were “on the critical path to enable the transfer of lead </p>
<p>responsibility for security to the ISF within the timescales we have been discussing in </p>
<p>DOP&#8209;I”. </p>
<p><b>919. </b> Mr Browne wrote to Dr Reid on 20 December, approving an additional £19.6m from </p>
<p>the Reserve for 734 patrol vehicles and 11 major infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>872</p>
<p> That was “on </p>
<p>the basis that they continue to meet the ISF’s highest priority needs and that funding </p>
<p>from alternative sources does not become available”.</p>
<p><b>920. </b> Mr Browne added that the delay to commencing withdrawal from Muthanna </p>
<p>and Maysan was “regrettable, particularly when the military advice is that there is no </p>
<p>overwhelming security need to postpone our withdrawal”. He asked to be kept informed </p>
<p>of the resource implications. </p>
<p><b>921. </b> On 21 December, AM Torpy wrote to Lt Gen Fry to highlight key issues for 2006 </p>
<p>(as described earlier in this Section).</p>
<p>873</p>
<p> On SSR resourcing, AM Torpy stated:</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>Legacy in the South</b></p>
<p><b>922. </b> Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry that, on his arrival in June, “the priority was definitely </p>
<p>Security Sector Reform”.</p>
<p>874</p>
<p> He said that the UK was optimistic about progress in the </p>
<p>South&#8209;East: </p>
<p>“I can remember being told actually, in my briefings in the MOD, that my job was to </p>
<p>go there for six months and make sure nothing went wrong because things were </p>
<p>going right, you know, just keep the thing ticking over and we will be okay.”</p>
<p><b>923. </b> He said that the priority of SSR was skewed “massively” by the increased security </p>
<p>threat shortly after he arrived which meant that more resource had to be devoted to </p>
<p>force protection.</p>
<p><b>924. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 13 July, CJO briefed that, of the planned total of </p>
<p>IPS officers, 58 percent had now been recruited and trained.</p>
<p>875</p>
<p> Reports suggested that </p>
<p>Maj Gen Dutton was encouraged by the progress made.</p>
<p><b>925. </b> On 26 August 2005, the IPU produced a discussion paper on what MND(SE) </p>
<p>should look like in autumn 2006.</p>
<p>876</p>
<p> The objective for “security/Rule of Law” was:</p>
<p>“Security forces (including police) which can provide sufficient law and order to avert </p>
<p>descent into full&#8209;blown criminality and chaos, and which owe their allegiance to the </p>
<p>state and local administrations, with tribal and militia allegiances managed.”</p>
<p><b>926. </b> The IPU noted that local political parties were inserting their followers into the </p>
<p>IPS and that there were reports of assassinations, abductions, torture, intimidation and </p>
<p>corruption.</p>
<p><b>927. </b> The IPU then posed a number of suggestions and questions that needed to be </p>
<p>addressed. Alongside lobbying various politicians and securing convictions of corrupt </p>
<p>police officers, the IPU asked:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How far do we go in reaching out to Shia militiamen … Is it fruitless to give </p>
<p>support to a Chief of Police who has no militia links?</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>928. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group considered the IPU paper on 2 September.</p>
<p>877</p>
<p> The lack of </p>
<p>progress on the police and a gap in funding for the Iraqi Armed Forces were highlighted. </p>
<p><b>Crime and power in Basra</b></p>
<p>Mr James Tansley took over as Consul General in Basra in September and sent a </p>
<p>telegram to FCO colleagues with his first impressions on 31 October.</p>
<p>878</p>
<p> He described </p>
<p>Basra as “a city whose social, political and economic structures had largely decayed”. </p>
<p>The political scene had been “dominated by rivalry between Sadrists and Baristas” and </p>
<p>differences between the two groups had grown in the last two years, flaring up into “open </p>
<p>confrontation”. </p>
<p>Mr Tansley wrote that the city was “a less liberal place than it was a year ago, with gangs </p>
<p>enforcing clampdowns on the sale of DVDs, musical instruments, alcohol, women’s attire </p>
<p>and behaviour and gambling through intimidation. Both Sunnis and Christians ha[d] been </p>
<p>targeted by Shia extremists.”</p>
<p>On crime, Mr Tansley wrote: </p>
<p>“The Iraqi Police do not compile crime statistics. But over the summer, our police </p>
<p>advisers have recorded an average of 65 murders a month in the province. </p>
<p>Kidnapping and extortion are rife. Basra has long been known for smuggling and </p>
<p>prostitution … [and] in recent years, the province has become an increasingly </p>
<p>important conduit for illegal drugs from Afghanistan via Iran.</p>
<p>“But the serious money today comes from oil smuggling … estimates from both </p>
<p>the US IRMO [Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office] and MND(SE) suggest </p>
<p>that possibly as much as 30 percent of the South’s oil production is appropriated </p>
<p>illegally …</p>
<p>“Corruption may be endemic throughout Iraq. But in Basra, where the opportunities </p>
<p>for illicit gain are greater, the stakes are higher … Links between crime and politics </p>
<p>abound. No prominent politician seems untainted, and all the main players have their </p>
<p>own militias with links to the various law enforcement agencies …</p>
<p>“Compared to Central and Northern Iraq, the number of coalition casualties in </p>
<p>Basra has been low. But the threat of kidnapping and EFP IED [Explosively Formed </p>
<p>Projective Improvised Explosive Device] attacks by anti&#8209;coalition groups remains </p>
<p>high, and disrupts both our and MND(SE)’s work. In addition, the levels of criminal, </p>
<p>political and sectarian violence are high and rising. This lawlessness overshadows </p>
<p>all life in Basra, and acts as a major obstacle to development …</p>
<p>“The police (IPS) are currently unable to address Basra’s security problems. Minimal </p>
<p>screening of entrants to the IPS after the fall of Saddam [Hussein], poor leadership </p>
<p>and the connections between politicians and crime in Basra have resulted in a force </p>
<p>riven with factions, many of whom are as likely to be involved in criminal activity as </p>
<p>helping to prevent it …”</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>267</p>
<p><b>929. </b> On 7 September, the FCO circulated a Transition Plan for the IPS in southern </p>
<p>Iraq, which had been produced by the Consulate in Basra in consultation with UK police </p>
<p>and military in theatre and agreed with DFID, the MOD and the Home Office.</p>
<p>879</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>was recognition that the Iraqi police had been limited in what they could achieve due </p>
<p>to a lack of trained personnel, shortages of equipment and inadequate facilities. The </p>
<p>plan aimed to address those factors by achieving a set of quantitative and qualitative </p>
<p>targets in the areas of training, police support infrastructure, intelligence capability, </p>
<p>operational capability and public support. The timetable for those targets was driven by </p>
<p>the established plans for military withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>930. </b> The plan stated:</p>
<p>“The IPS runs its own operations in Southern Iraq. Standards across the South </p>
<p>vary, but generally speaking the IPS has a growing capacity to perform policing </p>
<p>functions from community patrolling to counter&#8209;terrorism. It has enough training and </p>
<p>equipment to allow it to patrol 24 hours a day. It has the capability to respond to calls </p>
<p>for assistance from the public and co&#8209;ordinate with other agencies in an emergency. </p>
<p>It has the resources to tackle public disorder and is capable of gathering intelligence </p>
<p>and detecting crime. It knows how to manage a crime scene and exploit forensic </p>
<p>evidence.”</p>
<p><b>931. </b> The more detailed figures on police training provided in the FCO plan, when </p>
<p>compared with earlier MOD papers, made clear that the overall figure of 55 percent of </p>
<p>police trained masked considerable variations across MND(SE) – whereas 90 percent of </p>
<p>personnel in Dhi Qar province had received training, the figures for Muthanna and Basra </p>
<p>were considerably lower (40 percent and 42 percent respectively). The plan noted:</p>
<p>“Police reform in Basra is the most complex task facing us. Far more police need </p>
<p>training than in the other provinces [in MND(SE)] combined; and the culture of </p>
<p>corruption and abuse is deeply ingrained. Militia infiltration threatens our efforts to </p>
<p>encourage an independent apolitical police force.” </p>
<p><b>932. </b> The plan stated that the ability to solve those problems lay with the Iraqi authorities </p>
<p>and that there were no effective levers within the UK’s control. The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“The IPS in Southern Iraq is functioning, with minimal supervision. We could leave </p>
<p>today and it would continue to function. There would, however, remain serious </p>
<p>question marks about the destabilising activities of the militias, corruption, lack of </p>
<p>public accountability and human rights abuse within the IPS. We are addressing </p>
<p>these problems but they will not disappear overnight … We know where we want </p>
<p>to be at transition … We must be realistic about what we can achieve here: our </p>

<p>880</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the covering note he listed a number of causes for concern including: the “apparent </p>
<p>involvement of members of Basra Police in attacks against the MNF, and a claim from </p>
<p>the Basra Chief of Police that only 500 out of 12,000 Basra Police are loyal to him”.</p>
<p><b>934. </b> Mr Quarrey concluded by saying:</p>
<p>“We still do not have the comprehensive picture that we need of what is going </p>
<p>on in Basra. Kim Howells visits next week. I have spoken to his office today and </p>
<p>emphasised that you are personally very concerned about the situation and that we </p>
<p>need a serious report from him on this.”</p>

<p><b>936. </b> On 22 August 2005, Chief Inspector Barry Pollin, the Senior Police Adviser in </p>
<p>MND(SE), produced a report on the impact of political parties and tribes on the IPS </p>

<p><b>Tribal justice</b></p>
<p>The paper produced by Chief Inspector Barry Pollin, the Senior Police Adviser in </p>
<p>MND(SE), on 22 August 2005, included an annex on extra&#8209;judicial justice, which stated </p>
<p>that it was important for that issue to be “thoroughly addressed” given those influences </p>
<p>were “notoriously strong” in the South&#8209;East.</p>
<p>884</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The annex stated that a void within the Iraqi Law on criminal proceedings allowed for the </p>
<p>use of tribal justice through agreement between the tribes of the aggrieved party and the </p>
<p>perpetrator. In the majority of cases, that involved payment of financial compensation, </p>
<p>although other resolutions, such as arranged marriages, were also known. </p>

<p>It found that the “post&#8209;war instability of the Iraqi society appears to have increased </p>
<p>reliance on tribal justice even in the urban areas”. In some cases offences were not </p>
<p>reported to the police at all, but simply dealt with through the tribal justice system. </p>
<p>One example provided was alleged rape victims being placed in prison custody “to protect </p>
<p>them from honour&#8209;related violence from their tribe”.</p>
<p>The annex recommended that, in the longer term, the Iraqi Government should engage </p>
<p>the public in a general debate on tribal justice, including “its reasoning and justification”. </p>
<p>A comprehensive study of tribal justice was needed to understand its impact on the </p>
<p>criminal justice system. Efforts should also be made to raise awareness in criminal justice </p>
<p>institutions. Police training should include understanding which offences could legally </p>
<p>be resolved through the tribal system, and which must be referred to an investigating </p>
<p>magistrate. A dialogue should be commenced with tribal leaders to improve compliance </p>
<p>with Iraqi law.</p>
<p><b>937. </b> CI Pollin wrote:</p>
<p>“Immediately post&#8209;April 2003, the relationship between the IPS and the political </p>
<p>parties and their militia was largely opportunistic: it was based on the affiliation and </p>
<p>sympathies of individual members who were joining. (This is not the case in other </p>
<p>parts of the security forces.) However, more recently, political parties and militia have </p>
<p>been exploiting the lack of transparent recruitment, vetting and central oversight to </p>
<p>deliberately place their supporters within the IPS.</p>
<p>“It is assessed that the majority of IPS officers are associated with a political party </p>
<p>and/or tribe with whom their allegiance is stronger than their allegiance to the IPS. </p>
<p>The extent to these ties and the degree to which they undermine the efficiency of </p>
<p>the police to support the Rule of Law is significant. It is now likely that if called upon </p>
<p>to take action against them, the IPS would support their party’s militia or tribe. The </p>
<p>larger parties have well&#8209;armed and well&#8209;organised militias, but the paramilitary </p>
<p>capabilities of the tribes vary.</p>
<p>“Often, political party and tribal allegiances of one or both heavily influence the </p>
<p>dynamics of the relations between the Chiefs of Police and Provincial Governors. </p>
<p>The potential of the parties to use the IPS to effect political, social and religious </p>
<p>influence is a serious concern. By using affiliated IPS officers to carry out </p>
<p>‘de&#8209;Ba’athification’, the political parties are able to create vacancies in influential </p>
<p>positions within the IPS for their own members. There are also signs that Islamic </p>
<p>fundamentalism is increasing within IPS ranks.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the judiciary in the South is subject to interference either direct or </p>
<p>indirect from tribes, political parties, militia and IPS intimidation. Subsequently, they </p>
<p>are not the Rule of Law bulwark that they should be or that they need to be in order </p>
<p>to address tribal, religious or political party influence.”</p>

<p><b>The Jameat incident and subsequent developments</b></p>
<p><b>938. </b> On 17 September, UK forces detained two leading members of a JAM splinter </p>
<p>group.</p>
<p>885</p>
<p> On 19 September, two UK soldiers were arrested by the IPS in Basra and </p>
<p>taken to the Jameat Police Station. Negotiations to release the soldiers failed, and a </p>
<p>rescue was mounted by MND(SE). That became known as ‘the Jameat incident’ and is </p>
<p>described in detail in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>The Jameat incident</b></p>
<p>On 19 September, two UK soldiers were arrested by the IPS.</p>
<p>886</p>
<p> According to the account </p>
<p>provided to No.10 by Dr Reid’s office, the two soldiers had been working under cover </p>
<p>following up the operation against JAM the previous weekend. They had been parked </p>
<p>at the side of a road when an unmarked vehicle with four men in plain clothes pulled up </p>
<p>behind them. Two people got out of the car and walked towards the soldiers’ vehicle, with </p>
<p>weapons cocked. The UK soldiers, believing they were “facing death or serious injury”, </p>
<p>opened fire killing one of the men and wounding the other. Not realising the men they had </p>
<p>shot were police, the soldiers tried to escape but were blocked by police in several marked </p>
<p>vehicles who opened fire. At that point, the two soldiers put down their weapons and </p>
<p>produced their identification. </p>
<p>Although the uniformed police initially appeared willing to talk constructively with the </p>
<p>soldiers, “the atmosphere changed significantly” when Iraqi police arrived in plain clothes. </p>
<p>The two UK soldiers were reported to have been beaten and then taken to the Jameat </p>
<p>Police Station, which was known to MND(SE) as a “notorious detention facility” and </p>
<p>home of the Serious Crimes Unit (SCU), “which had been infiltrated by militant elements, </p>
<p>especially the Jaysh al Mahdi and (by his own admission) were outside the control of the </p>
<p>Chief of Police”.</p>
<p>Negotiations to hand over the arrested soldiers to MNF, in line with agreed practice where </p>
<p>MNF personnel were arrested by ISF, failed and the negotiators themselves were unable </p>
<p>to leave the Jameat Police Station. The Governor and Chief of Police had made it clear </p>
<p>that they were not in a position to offer any assistance and, despite explicit directions by </p>
<p>the Chief of Police to release the two soldiers, the IPS refused to comply. Orders from the </p>
<p>MOI in Baghdad were similarly disregarded. The General commanding the 10th Division </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Army also “refused to get involved in the incident”.</p>
<p>A rescue operation was successfully mounted by MND(SE) using armed force to free the </p>
<p>six negotiators and the two soldiers. That was achieved without casualties on either side </p>
<p>but caused significant damage to the wall of the police station and several police vehicles. </p>
<p>The two soldiers who had originally been arrested were found to have been taken to a </p>
<p>house away from the police station and held by what was suspected to be a mixture of </p>
<p>JAM and IPS personnel. A further rescue operation was carried out successfully (again </p>
<p>without casualties) to free them later that evening.</p>

<p><b>939. </b> The Chiefs of Staff considered the events at their meeting on 21 September, </p>
<p>briefed by Lieutenant General Andrew Ridgway, the Chief of Defence Intelligence.</p>
<p>887</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The minutes recorded that:</p>
<p>“The incident in Basra was the inevitable product of the dual loyalties of IPS </p>
<p>members: whilst giving Iraqis status and pay, it also enabled them to sustain their </p>
<p>tribal, religious and – in the worst cases – militia associations; these reflected Iraqi </p>
<p>and Middle Eastern society, did not necessarily represent infiltration, but would </p>
<p>endure and thus would remain a key planning consideration for Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform (SSR).</p>
<p>“The success of SSR depended on the proportion of the Iraqi Security Force </p>
<p>(ISF) personnel that enjoyed these dual loyalties benignly without affecting their </p>
<p>professional integrity, against the number that exploited their ISF positions to effect </p>
<p>intimidation and murder … this proportion was not known and was unlikely to be </p>
<p>clear for another six&#8209;nine months …</p>
<p>“The continued existence of insurgents in the ISF evinced the weakness of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior (MOI): having failed to purge and reform the IPS, despite </p>
<p>being aware of problems for at least a year, the MOI needed to be galvanised by UK </p>
<p>Government pressure through the Cabinet Office.”</p>
<p><b>940. </b> Mr Straw chaired a meeting on 23 September – involving Dr Reid, Mr Benn, </p>
<p>Gen Walker and senior officials from No.10, the FCO and DFID – to discuss the incident </p>
<p>and agree what advice should be put to Mr Blair on current policy for South East Iraq.</p>
<p>888</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A record of the meeting by Dr Reid’s Private Secretary stated Sir Nigel Sheinwald </p>
<p>“stressed that the PM needed advice on how to deal with the political and security </p>
<p>strands of our policy; he was not expecting a sudden lurch in any direction away from </p>
<p>our current plan”. </p>
<p><b>941. </b> The record stated: </p>
<p>“During discussion it was stressed that the incident … should be seen as a relatively </p>
<p>minor one which had resulted in a great deal of media attention.”</p>
<p><b>942. </b> Those present at the meeting “agreed that the incident would probably prove to </p>
<p>be a blip but it had highlighted the need to review the overall strategy and ensure we </p>
<p>were on the right track”. Dr Reid “suggested that the IPS be audited by a UK specialist”, </p>
<p>Mr Asquith agreed to investigate the practicality of getting someone like Sir Ronnie </p>
<p>Flanagan, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, to provide the analysis.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>An assessment of the Iraqi Security Forces</b></p>
<p>On 28 September 2005, the JIC assessed the security situation in the South.</p>
<p>889</p>
<p> On the </p>
<p>ISF and local governance, it stated:</p>
<p>“This fragility of local governance is not new and is mirrored to a greater or lesser </p>
<p>degree across the country. We have previously judged the Iraqi security forces </p>
<p>(ISF) in the South to be brittle, largely untested and under the influence of political </p>
<p>and tribal factions; and noted that the relationship between regional and national </p>
<p>government is tenuous. The effectiveness of the police in particular has been a </p>
<p>persistent concern. Policemen have been implicated in the recent murder of two </p>
<p>journalists working for US papers; intelligence has indicated serious abuse of </p>
<p>prisoners on political and sectarian grounds; and […] some police were conducting </p>
<p>assassinations on behalf of political militias […] The scale of divided loyalty within </p>
<p>the police, and the ISF more generally, is difficult to quantify. Most members of the </p>
<p>ISF undoubtedly have allegiance to political factions or tribes: under pressure their </p>
<p>reliability will be doubtful. We judge that a significant number actively colludes with </p>
<p>Shia extremist militias.”</p>
<p><b>943. </b> The Iraqi and UK authorities in Basra conducted separate investigations into the </p>
<p>Jameat incident.</p>
<p>890</p>
<p> Mr Patey met Prime Minister Ja’afari to discuss the Iraqi report </p>
<p>on 30 September. The Iraqi investigation found faults on both sides but attributed </p>
<p>“80 percent of the blame … to the British”, a position that was refuted by Mr Patey. When </p>
<p>pressed on the need to take action against the militia influence at the Jameat Police </p>
<p>Station, Mr Ja’afari claimed that the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) gave central </p>
<p>government very little control over the local police. Mr Patey reminded Mr Ja’afari that </p>
<p>the worst offenders were the CIU which reported directly to the Minister of the Interior. </p>
<p><b>944. </b> The UK military’s investigation into the incident concluded that no crime had been </p>
<p>committed by the UK’s soldiers, as reported to Dr Reid by a junior MOD official on </p>
<p>28 November.</p>
<p>891</p>
<p> Two separate investigations were carried out by military officers from </p>
<p>the regiment responsible for troops at the Jameat cordon who judged that the actions </p>
<p>of British troops were compliant with the Rules of Engagement and their right to self </p>
<p>defence. They deemed that no further investigation by the Special Investigation Branch </p>
<p>was required. Those findings had been reviewed by “a higher authority” and endorsed </p>
<p>by AM Torpy and Gen Walker.</p>
<p><b>945. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 5 October, the minutes recorded a “need to </p>
<p>resolve differences” between the UK’s enquiry into events at Jameat and those of </p>
<p>the Iraqi investigation team.</p>
<p>892</p>
<p> They hoped to close the issue with a “Joint (Iraqi/UK) </p>
<p>statement when one could be agreed”.</p>

<p>273</p>
<p><b>946. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the DOP(I) meeting on 12 October (circulated on </p>
<p>11 October) confirmed that a joint statement had been agreed.</p>
<p>893</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>947. </b> The final paper for Mr Blair was produced on 30 September by the FCO, the MOD </p>
<p>and DFID.</p>
<p>894</p>
<p> It was sent to No.10 by Mr Peter Hayes, Principal Private Secretary to </p>
<p>Mr Straw. It stated:</p>
<p>“The security incident on 19 September … highlights what was previously more </p>
<p>opaque, that we face acute challenges in achieving our objectives in the South&#8209;East </p>
<p>region. Stability in the South&#8209;East is being threatened by intense rivalry among </p>
<p>political parties and their militias. Criminality, jockeying for patronage and leaders’ </p>
<p>differing political visions are being exacerbated by tribalism and increasing religiosity. </p>
<p>Specifically, this has a severe impact on the effectiveness of the police service.” </p>
<p><b>948. </b> The paper stated that negative media reporting was “wrong”: </p>
<p>“While militia rivalry is a fact of life in the Basra police, the behaviour of the Jameat </p>
<p>police station … is not representative of the police service as a whole. Some 70 out </p>
<p>of 240 Jameat officers are pursuing primarily a militia rather than an IPS agenda. </p>
<p>This should be set against a total southern police force of around 14,000. Police </p>
<p>officers will continue to have dual loyalties to the state on one hand and militia/tribe </p>
<p>on the other. It will take five, possibly 10 years to train up a sufficiently large cadre of </p>
<p>middle management police officers loyal to state institutions.”</p>
<p><b>949. </b> Although the Basra Governor and Provincial Council had “refused to do business </p>
<p>with us”, their credibility meant that the effect was “not significant”. The “immediate </p>
<p>problem” was whether there would be “reprisal” attacks on UK personnel, and whether </p>
<p>police and prison mentors could safely be deployed to ISF units. Training teams had </p>
<p>been withdrawn from Basra city and some areas beyond, but the British military were </p>
<p>“back on the ground visiting police stations”.</p>
<p><b>950. </b> On whether the UK was “on the right policy course”, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“<b>Asserting direct British control</b> over local government and rule of [law] </p>
<p>institutions is out of the question. There is no legal base for this … If, on the </p>
<p>other hand, we were to <b>pull out more rapidly</b>, the Transitional Government and </p>
<p>security forces would be unable to fill the vacuum. Militia rivalry would escalate. </p>
<p>Iran’s influence would be entirely unchecked. We would be accused of ‘cutting and </p>
<p>running’.</p>
<p>“<b>Our only realistic option is to maintain our course and see the job through</b>. </p>
<p>But <b>we need to make adjustments to our policy</b>, while sticking to our strategic </p>
<p>approach of ensuring in due course successful transition of responsibility for Rule </p>
<p>of Law in the South&#8209;East to the Iraqis … We should apply pressure on the Iraqi </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>authorities to take action against those who abuse and represent a threat to law and </p>
<p>order … they should start with firm action against Jameat personnel.” </p>
<p><b>951. </b> The immediate next steps identified by Mr Hayes included to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Secure an explicit undertaking from the Governor and (new) Chief of </b></p>
<p><b>Police</b> that our personnel will be able to operate in safety”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Get a clear commitment from Baghdad politicians to grip the South&#8209;East</b>”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Get the Interior Minister to visit Basra,</b> immediately”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Demonstrate to the international community (in particular, the US) that </b></p>
<p><b>we can handle the situation</b>” – while the underlying problems in Basra were </p>
<p>“serious”, they were “not new” and could be managed by the UK; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Consider the <b>dispatch of a senior UK police officer</b>” to “audit the police in </p>
<p>MND(SE)”. </p>
<p><b>952. </b> Amongst the actions advised by Mr Hayes for the medium and longer term were </p>
<p>that the UK would need to ensure an “<b>effective</b>” Chief of Police was in place (potentially </p>
<p>replacing the incumbent with no party ties with one with “political clout”), to redeploy </p>
<p>training teams and allocate more resources.</p>
<p><b>953. </b> The paper also cautioned: “we may not be able to deliver, by next year, the </p>
<p>minimum standards required in Rule of Law and governance.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>954. </b> In response, Mr Blair agreed that there was no need to change the overall strategy </p>
<p>but Sir Nigel Sheinwald recorded in a letter on 4 October to Mr Hayes: </p>
<p>“He [Mr Blair] is convinced … that we need a major and sustained push over the </p>
<p>next few months on the political and security lines of operation if we are to get what </p>
<p>we need – the political process moving ahead on time and producing an effective </p>
<p>and moderate Iraqi Government after the elections, with visible progress on the </p>
<p>Iraqiisation of security.”</p>
<p>895</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>955. </b> Mr Blair agreed to a review to establish “whether our police training strategy in the </p>
<p>South&#8209;East is working, and whether the national policing strategy knits together”. He </p>
<p>also agreed that a visit by Sir Ronnie Flanagan would be a good idea. Mr Blair wanted “a </p>
<p>UK Minister to take ownership of our overall policing strategy, including our liaison with </p>
<p>the US over national strategy” and that “this needs to be supported by a dedicated and </p>
<p>sufficiently strong team in London”. The FCO was asked to work on that with the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office and the MOD, though the letter also noted that “the Prime Minister would be </p>
<p>grateful if the Defence Secretary could continue to oversee the overall security strategy”.</p>

<p>275</p>
<p><b>956. </b> In an email on 7 October to senior officials in the Home Office and the FCO, </p>
<p>CC Kernaghan said that he was “naturally supportive” of Sir Ronnie’s appointment to </p>
<p>review the UK’s policing contribution in Iraq.</p>
<p>896</p>
<p> However, he expressed concern that </p>
<p>there was an “apparent lack of strategic vision” within the UK Government and asked </p>
<p>whether Mr Blair had ever been briefed on his earlier reports, particularly his first report </p>
<p>dated May 2003 (described earlier in this Section). He highlighted a number of issues </p>
<p>that he believed a review of the UK’s strategy on policing in Iraq needed to take into </p>
<p>account, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the level of resource – finance and personnel – that the UK was willing to </p>
<p>commit; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an assessment of what influence the UK had with both the Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>the US in the context of SSR; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the UK’s interest was limited to MND(SE) or applied to Iraq as a whole.</p>
<p><b>957. </b> On 10 October, Mr Wheeler produced an update of policing in each of the </p>
<p>four MND(SE) provinces.</p>
<p>897</p>
<p> He described both Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces </p>
<p>as “conducive to police reform” but highlighted more serious issues in the other two </p>
<p>provinces. His comments on Maysan province are dealt with later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>958. </b> On Basra, he said:</p>
<p>“In Basra the situation is most complex. The security threat is high (we are in </p>
<p>lock&#8209;down but are reviewing whether PAT movements might happen under military </p>
<p>escort). There is significant IPS/militia affiliation, abuse and assassinations are </p>
<p>carried out by those in the Jameat and the Governor and Council have recently been </p>
<p>encouraging non co&#8209;operation …”</p>
<p><b>959. </b> On 24 October, Maj Gen Dutton wrote to Maj Gen Wall, setting out his views and </p>
<p>proposals for action to improve management of the IPS programme.</p>
<p>898</p>
<p> On the nature of </p>
<p>the current problems, he stated:</p>
<p>“The events of 19 September 2005 in Basra brought the issue into sharp focus and </p>
<p>to public attention, but nothing that happened in that incident will have come as a </p>
<p>surprise to anyone who had been involved or who had followed the reporting from </p>
<p>MND (SE) over a period of many months. The problems associated with the Jameat </p>
<p>Police Station: the lack of control and authority of the Basra Chief of Police and the </p>
<p>problems of the divided loyalties of many policemen who are controlled (and indeed </p>
<p>in some places planted in the Police) by militant factions, was well known and </p>
<p>reported. Knowledge of the problem does not of course make the situation any more </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>tolerable but my point is that nothing changed on 19 September and we should not </p>
<p>therefore assume that the existing strategy for police SSR is wholly off&#8209;track or </p>
<p>now inappropriate, nor should it overshadow the excellent work being done at the </p>
<p>tactical level.”</p>
<p><b>960. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry Lt Gen Dutton said that the military was “certainly </p>
<p>aware” of the reputation of Jameat police station, but:</p>
<p>“… did it come as a surprise? Yes, because … it was an event that was triggered </p>
<p>by individuals getting themselves into a fire fight and then being taken to that police </p>
<p>station. So … it is not as if the Jameat police station incident … evolved from a </p>
<p>series of other events; it was a particular thing that caused it. So it was certainly a </p>
<p>surprise.”</p>
<p>899</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>961. </b> Lt Gen Dutton said that the incident had “huge effect” in London and at PJHQ </p>
<p>but that “it calmed down quite quickly”. With hindsight, Lt Gen Dutton said that “there </p>
<p>perhaps wasn’t as much upwards communication to Baghdad, to keep them in the </p>
<p>picture, as would have been useful”.</p>
<p><b>962. </b> Lt Gen Riley told the Inquiry that, although the Jameat incident occurred after he </p>
<p>had left Iraq, he “would not have expected it”.</p>
<p>900</p>
<p> Explaining how it arose, he said:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi police in the South … reflected the local political climate and the tensions, </p>
<p>and all the tensions that were present in southern Iraqi society played out in the </p>
<p>police …”</p>
<p><b>963. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lieutenent General John Cooper, GOC MND(SE) </p>
<p>from December 2005 to July 2006, referred to the fall&#8209;out with the Basra Provincial </p>
<p>Council as “the divorce”.</p>
<p>901</p>
<p> He said that the restricted access to Basra’s police stations </p>
<p>that followed enabled “a series of murder squads and corruption to become endemic” </p>
<p>and “produced a climate of lawlessness” inside Basra’s police. Lt Gen Cooper told </p>
<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… because we were not allowed to go back into contact until May of 2006, it meant </p>
<p>that we lost ground and we lost time.” </p>
<p><b>964. </b> Lt Gen Cooper added that “some policemen would still allow us in, but the vast </p>
<p>majority were following the Provincial Council direction that they weren’t to have </p>
<p>anything to do with us”.</p>
<p>902</p>
<p> He said that the Council only re&#8209;engaged when a “major </p>
<p>security incident” occurred after a Lynx helicopter was shot down in May 2006.</p>
<p><b>965. </b> Lieutenent General Sir Richard Shirreff, GOC MND(SE) from July 2006 until </p>
<p>January 2007, also told the Inquiry about restrictions on visiting Basra’s police stations. </p>

<p>He said that in the six months following the incident “there had been virtually no activity” </p>
<p>in police stations, and many “had simply not been touched”.</p>
<p>903</p>
<p><b>The MOD takes the lead on policing</b></p>
<p><b>966. </b> On 12 September 2005, a week before the Jameat incident, Dr Reid wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Blair advising that “considerable progress” had been made in training the ISF since </p>
<p>May.</p>
<p>904</p>
<p> He recommended that “consequently, an overall reduction of about 500 troops” </p>
<p>would be possible in “October/November”.</p>
<p><b>967. </b> On 10 October, Dr Reid announced in the House of Commons plans to reduce </p>
<p>force levels in MND(SE) by “about 500”.</p>
<p>905</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>968. </b> In the subsequent debate, Mr Michael Ancram asked Dr Reid about the level of </p>
<p>infiltration by “Iranian&#8209;backed insurgents” in the police. Dr Reid responded:</p>
<p>“In any theatre of combat in the world where competing factions have been at war </p>
<p>with each other there is always a problem of split loyalties when rehabilitating and </p>
<p>restructuring the police force afterwards. The question is not whether those split </p>
<p>loyalties exist, but whether we can diminish them by human rights training and </p>
<p>training the police to be as objective as possible … However, although there are </p>
<p>certain elements in the police service in Iraq about who we ought to be worried, </p>
<p>I would not want him to believe that that is the majority or anything like it. Let us </p>
<p>remember that every time Iraqi policemen put on their uniforms in the morning, they </p>
<p>go out to face the threat of death. Many of them have died leading operations. Even </p>
<p>in Basra, there were police around the Jameat Police Station trying to ensure that </p>
<p>the 250 to 300 militant demonstrators did not approach it. So it is not the case that </p>
<p>all the police, even in Basra, were antagonistic towards us.”</p>
<p><b>969. </b> Dr Reid provided Mr Blair with a security update on 11 October.</p>

<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“Despite a lack of an Iraqi lead from Baghdad, MND(SE) have continued to build </p>

<p>Enforcement (DBE) … whilst playing a supporting role in the training and mentoring </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) … </p>
<p>“Progress on Iraqiisation continues. There are now 190,000 members of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces trained and equipped … </p>
<p>“SSR for the Iraqi Army continues to be on track for our transition plans … </p>
<p>“On policing, the situation is less satisfactory. We need to do further work between </p>
<p>MOD, FCO, DFID and the Home Office to improve support to IPS development at </p>
<p>the strategic level … Problems of divided loyalties and militia links can only be dealt </p>
<p>with by the political will of an effective Iraqi Government …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We need to review our strategy on policing … at two levels … In Baghdad … there </p>
<p>would be a good case for providing a senior Home Office official with the right </p>
<p>experience to work with the MOI … Sir Ronnie Flanagan [will] visit MND(SE) soon </p>
<p>to carry out an audit of the effectiveness of [the] police training programme … Part </p>
<p>of this work might include an assessment of the Italians’ programme in Dhi Qar </p>
<p>province.”</p>
<p><b>970. </b> Dr Reid’s paper sought clarification of whether or not it was intended there </p>
<p>should be a re&#8209;assignment of Ministerial responsibilities for policing, noting that DOP(I) </p>
<p>would need to take a collective view on the issue and that “there would be resource </p>
<p>implications if MOD were to take this on”. </p>
<p><b>971. </b> Gen Jackson visited Iraq from 10 to 13 October.</p>
<p>907</p>
<p> His visit report noted that, of </p>
<p>the four key strategic areas (SSR, governance, reconstruction and counter&#8209;insurgency </p>
<p>work), he “only saw encouraging signs of progress in one: SSR” though that progress </p>
<p>was still “patchy”, with the UK’s “undoubted success with the Iraqi Army” contrasting with </p>
<p>the position of the Iraqi police: </p>
<p>“The events of 19 September in Basra are merely indicative of a wider malaise </p>
<p>across the IPS as a whole. We are where we are, but it is not to our credit that we </p>
<p>have known about the inadequacies of the IPS for so long and yet failed to address </p>
<p>them. We must do so now … Whatever the eventual remedial plan is, it must be </p>
<p>resourced and led properly. It must also address the specific needs of an Iraqi police </p>
<p>force facing Iraq’s current security climate. More UK Police trainers are not the </p>
<p>answer. I have heard not one complimentary word about their involvement during </p>
<p>my last two visits. We, the military, must be prepared to shoulder an extra training </p>
<p>burden here.”</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>972. </b> At the meeting of DOP(I) on 12 October, the Committee discussed the need “to </p>
<p>do more to speed up the development of police” but considered that “the plan for ISF </p>
<p>development that was in place was largely sound”.</p>
<p>908</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>973. </b> The Committee agreed that the MOD would take the lead on “police issues in Iraq” </p>
<p>as “the Iraqi policing situation called for a para&#8209;military, rather than a civilian, style of </p>
<p>policing”. </p>
<p><b>974. </b> Although the MOD would take responsibility for police issues, the FCO continued </p>
<p>to administer the police secondments to Iraq and to manage the contract with </p>
<p>ArmorGroup for IPAs.</p>
<p>909</p>
<p><b>975. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Dutton commented on the move of </p>
<p>responsibility for policing to the MOD: </p>
<p>“I didn’t get the impression that it had a great deal of effect at all, because what did </p>
<p>it actually mean? On the ground it didn’t really mean anything; it meant that one </p>
<p>particular Secretary of State felt he was now responsible for the police as well … but </p>
<p>it didn’t produce more resources, it didn’t, to my mind, sort out the structural problem </p>
<p>we have … about being able to train those sorts of policemen.”</p>
<p>910</p>
<p><b>976. </b> On 31 October, an MOD paper about the reform of the IPS described the number </p>
<p>of UK civilian personnel devoted to policing.</p>
<p>911</p>
<p> It totalled over 200 and comprised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>105 UK police officers funded through the [FCO’s] Peacekeeping Fund at a cost </p>
<p>of £3.3m for financial year 2005/06:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>61 UK staff based in Jordan, delivering eight&#8209;week Basic Recruit Training;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>26 serving and retired UK police officers in MND(SE) mentoring, liaising </p>
<p>and conducting specialist training courses with the Iraqi police; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>18 serving and retired UK police officers in Baghdad, including the </p>
<p>UK Chief Police Adviser focusing on: IPS development, planning and </p>
<p>mentoring the Police Minister, forensics, criminal intelligence, training at </p>
<p>the staff officer college.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>106 UK International Police Advisers provided by ArmorGroup, funded by the </p>
<p>GCPP (£11.1m for financial year 2005/06) and by the Dutch and Japanese </p>
<p>governments; five of those contractors were based in Baghdad and the </p>
<p>remainder in MND(SE), acting as advisers, mentors (including to each Provincial </p>
<p>Chief of Police in MND(SE)) and trainers.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>977. </b> Additionally, in Dhi Qar province the Italian brigade was responsible for IPS training </p>
<p>and mentoring, employing their Carabinieri. Royal Military Police (RMP) and other </p>
<p>coalition troops (including Danes and Czechs) were involved in mentoring and follow&#8209;up </p>
<p>training in the other three provinces. CPATT also provided International Police Liaison </p>
<p>Officers (IPLOs) to MND(SE) to conduct training and mentoring, and to ensure that </p>
<p>training in MND(SE) was consistent with efforts elsewhere in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>978. </b> In total, including the spend on equipping the police under Project OSIRIS </p>
<p>(described earlier in this Section), police SSR spending represented less than two </p>
<p>percent of the annual spend by the UK on Iraq – estimated to be £1bn in financial year </p>
<p>2005/06.</p>
<p><b>979. </b> The Chiefs of Staff considered SSR on 18 October.</p>
<p>912</p>
<p> They concluded: “The </p>
<p>military effort was well resourced compared to the commitments by other Government </p>
<p>departments.” Now that Dr Reid would be responsible for SSR in Iraq, it would be </p>
<p>“important to calculate the resources needed to deliver [this] and to secure appropriate </p>
<p>HMT [Treasury] funding”.</p>
<p><b>980. </b> On 24 October, Maj Gen Dutton sent a paper with proposals on how to reform the </p>
<p>IPS programme in MND(SE) to Maj Gen Wall.</p>
<p>913</p>
<p> He wrote that:</p>
<p>“As time has gone by, it has become clear that the aspirations in the existing plan </p>
<p>are unachievable. We need to be realistic about what we can expect to achieve: we </p>
<p>should be aiming for a police force that is relevant and ‘good enough’ for this region.” </p>
<p><b>981. </b> Maj Gen Dutton stated: “We must dismiss any ideas of starting again: it is reform </p>
<p>that is required, not complete re&#8209;design.” He proposed “a three&#8209;point plan”: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removal of those senior elements of the IPS who were engaged in serious crime, </p>
<p>acknowledging that that may require the MNF to act if it could not be achieved </p>
<p>by the ITG;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>dismissal of uncommitted IPS officers (estimated by the Basra Chief of Police to </p>
<p>number around 6,000 in a total force of 30,000); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“redoubling efforts on training the remaining police, so that eventually the ‘good’ </p>
<p>outweighs the ‘bad’”. </p>
<p><b>982. </b> On 25 October, Mr Tansley submitted recommendations along similar lines to the </p>
<p>FCO, also proposing the three&#8209;point plan.</p>
<p>914</p>
<p> He wrote that a “key part” of the plan would </p>
<p>be for “joint teams” from PATs and MND(SE) conducting “surges” on police districts and </p>
<p>stations that were “exposed as the weakest or of most importance”.</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>281</p>
<p><b>983. </b> Although the two papers were broadly the same, Mr Tansley suggested that the </p>
<p>dismissal of IPS officers would require the implementation of a planned MOI redundancy </p>
<p>package whereas Maj Gen Dutton saw that as desirable but not essential. Mr Tansley </p>
<p>also suggested that a suitably qualified senior civil servant should be deployed to assist </p>
<p>MOI reform.</p>
<p><b>984. </b> Both papers suggested that the numbers of military personnel dedicated to </p>
<p>support police reform should be increased (to include an extra two infantry companies, </p>
<p>RMP personnel and administrative staff) and that restrictions on movement of police </p>
<p>officers and contractors should be eased to allow them to move with the military.</p>
<p><b>985. </b> Mr Tansley suggested that there should be joint responsibility for delivery between </p>
<p>the Senior Police Adviser and the Task Force Commander in each province, with </p>
<p>ArmorGroup personnel directly managed by the Senior Police Adviser. Maj Gen Dutton’s </p>
<p>paper did not suggest a formal command structure but did cite “lack of unity of </p>
<p>command” as a major part of the problem.</p>
<p><b>986. </b> Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry that there was “nothing particularly magical” about </p>
<p>the three&#8209;point plan:</p>
<p>“It was a very simple plan, but it was designed in some ways to counter what I </p>
<p>thought was a feeling from elsewhere, that the only answer to the Basra police force </p>
<p>was to disband it completely and start again from scratch.”</p>
<p>915</p>
<p><b>987. </b> On 27 October, Dr Reid reported to Cabinet that the build&#8209;up of Iraqi security </p>
<p>forces was “going well” but that they “were generally not yet capable of operating on </p>
<p>their own”.</p>
<p>916</p>
<p> He stated that he and Mr Straw were looking at ways of addressing militia </p>
<p>infiltration in the Iraqi police.</p>
<p><b>988. </b> On 31 October, the MOD produced a paper about the UK’s policy on the IPS </p>
<p>to be considered at the next DOP(I).</p>
<p>917</p>
<p> The paper outlined the approach advocated </p>
<p>by Mr Tansley and Maj Gen Dutton but proposed that all police reform in MND(SE) </p>
<p>should be consolidated “under unified military direction … enabling the GOC to deploy </p>
<p>additional (civil and military) resources as necessary”. The MOD stated: </p>
<p>“… the utility of the civil police contingent … is limited by their contractual terms </p>
<p>of service and civilian working practices … If they were brought under military </p>
<p>direction (the command and control issues would need to be finessed) the policing </p>
<p>component would be employed to meet the priorities of operational transition, with </p>
<p>its output reported through the established military chain.”</p>

<p>282</p>
<p><b>989. </b> The minutes of the DOP(I) meeting on 3 November recorded: </p>
<p>“… there was considerable concern … among British police at the prospect of police </p>
<p>advisers in Iraq being placed under military command …”</p>
<p>918</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>990. </b> Ministers agreed:</p>
<p>“Departments, notably the FCO, MOD and Home Office, should work together </p>
<p>to agree a way forward on command and control of the policing effort … </p>
<p>Paul Kernaghan should also be consulted.”</p>
<p><b>991. </b> The DOP(I) minutes did not record any discussion of increasing military resource </p>
<p>or lifting movement restrictions. See the Box earlier in this Section, ‘Security restrictions </p>
<p>on UK police officers’, for more detail on civilian security restrictions.</p>
<p><b>992. </b> On 9 November, Maj Gen Dutton reported that a new Police Strategic Steering </p>
<p>Group had met for the first time that week.</p>
<p>919</p>
<p> That brought together the Consul </p>
<p>General, GOC MND(SE), the Senior Police Adviser and members of the GOC’s staff. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Dutton wrote:</p>
<p>“I am confident that we are now approaching a situation where we can make best </p>
<p>use of the different capabilities which the civil police, contractors and my own </p>
<p>soldiers, including Royal Military Police, can provide. The Consul General and I </p>

<p>920</p>
<p> was held on </p>
<p>17 November.</p>
<p>921</p>
<p> It was chaired by Mr Howard, reflecting the transfer of responsibility for </p>
<p>policing to MOD. The meeting addressed what that transfer meant and the command </p>
<p>and control issues in MND(SE). In an email to DCC Smith, CC Kernaghan summarised:</p>
<p>“Lead status remains to be defined but no one argued that you were in a line of </p>
<p>command relationship with the GOC or that your professional judgement could be </p>
<p>over&#8209;ruled by anyone else in theatre.”</p>
<p><b>994. </b> In a report dated 20 November, DCC Smith was critical of military co&#8209;ordination </p>
<p>with police in MND(SE):</p>
<p>“Despite reassurances from London it is quite clear, to myself and senior CivPol </p>
<p>officers on the ground in Basra, that the military are initiating changes in their </p>
<p>relationship with CivPol. This is unfortunate as it is increasingly becoming obvious </p>

<p><b>995. </b> The MOD produced a paper entitled ‘Strategy for the UK’s contribution to Iraq </p>

<p>923</p>
<p> It described three key outcomes:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>security up to the December elections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>activity up to the handover of security responsibility; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>achievement and maintenance of ISF self&#8209;reliance.</p>
<p><b>996. </b> Four supporting objectives were detailed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establishment of a secure environment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>transition to tactical, operational and strategic overwatch;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>development of an effective, self&#8209;sufficient IPS: “Although wholesale national </p>
<p>reform of the IPS is beyond the scope of UK influence, the provision of a </p>
<p>technically competent IPS at a local level within MND(SE) is possible with the </p>
<p>appropriate resource and is fundamental to an enduring handover. Mindful of the </p>
<p>endemic nature of divided loyalty and militia involvement, the UK must continue </p>
<p>to pursue IPS reform within MND(SE) to a level that will support handover – </p>
<p>nothing more/nothing less”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>governance and capacity&#8209;building in key Ministries (MOI and the IMOD) within </p>

<p> In </p>
<p>the South, he judged that the “key area to address was militia influence in the Basra IPS </p>
<p>and the lack of real MOI authority into the province”. To achieve that, he identified four </p>
<p>elements that would need to be addressed: </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>999. </b> On 12 December, Maj Gen Dutton submitted his Hauldown Report to AM Torpy.</p>
<p>926</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wrote that the threat from IEDs had “radically affected our freedom of manoeuvre and </p>
<p>consequently inhibited” SSR work (see Section 14.1 for detail on the IED threat).</p>
<p><b>1000. </b> On the Iraqi Army, Maj Gen Dutton reported:</p>
<p>“The development of the Iraqi Army is the ‘jewel in the crown’ of our SSR effort and </p>
<p>we must not let up now. The MiTT [Military Transition Team] system has been a </p>
<p>great success … their contribution to the ‘conceptual’ and ‘moral’ development of </p>
<p>10th Division has been enormous … I acknowledge the desire to shift responsibility </p>
<p>to the Iraqis themselves to prevent over&#8209;dependence, but the structure is built on </p>
<p>‘foundations of sand’ and will require support for some time yet.”</p>
<p><b>1001. </b> On the IPS, Maj Gen Dutton wrote:</p>
<p>“I have written more than enough on this. I believe that, over time, the IPS can </p>
<p>be reformed to an acceptable level, but there is no simple quick solution, which </p>
<p>is, I sense, what London wants. In fact, it will be a long hard slog and will need </p>
<p>unwavering commitment. The one critical point I must stress is that the UK should </p>
<p>never again expect to be able to undertake police restructuring and reform in this </p>
<p>sort of environment using UK police: they do not have the institutional structure or </p>
<p>expertise to cope, nor can they be compulsorily deployed.”</p>
<p><b>1002. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Dutton said: </p>
<p>“We had some excellent policemen but simply not sufficient to take on the role of </p>
<p>police training, which is why it had to be done in … a very poor way, but as best we </p>
<p>could, by the military.”</p>
<p>927</p>
<p><b>1003. </b> Lt Gen Dutton said that there was “nothing wrong” with the policemen, “there just </p>
<p>weren’t enough of them”.</p>
<p>928</p>
<p> He continued:</p>
<p>“My criticism of the UK’s policing – expeditionary policing effort has never been </p>
<p>aimed at the individual policemen who do it, simply the fact that I don’t believe </p>
<p>we, in the UK, have a system for expeditionary policing that will work in the sort of </p>
<p>environment of Iraq or Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>1004. </b> On 21 December, AM Torpy wrote to Lt Gen Fry to highlight the key issues </p>
<p>for 2006.</p>
<p>929</p>
<p> On the police he reiterated the need to “maintain momentum and our </p>
<p>commitment, pushing ahead quickly with any new work recommended by Ronnie </p>
<p>Flanagan”. He then drew attention to Maj Gen Dutton’s Hauldown Report and stated: </p>

<p>285</p>
<p>SIR RONNIE FLANAGAN’S REVIEW</p>
<p><b>1005. </b> On 18 October, a meeting was held at the Home Office to discuss the terms of </p>
<p>reference for Sir Ronnie Flanagan’s visit to Iraq, attended by Sir Ronnie, CC Kernaghan </p>
<p>and senior representatives from the FCO, the MOD and the Home Office.</p>
<p>930</p>
<p> Some of the </p>
<p>points made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the FCO wanted to understand the progress in MND(SE) and how that could be </p>
<p>improved upon, considering how this fitted with work in Baghdad and London; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD felt that current IPS training could be more efficient; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“much of Whitehall [was] not aware of elements that are beyond UK control. </p>
<p>It would be helpful if Sir Ronnie could highlight these as part of his report”.</p>
<p><b>1006. </b> CC Kernaghan circulated the terms of reference on 10 November and </p>
<p>summarised Sir Ronnie’s task as to “concentrate on assessing the resourcing and </p>
<p>effectiveness of the UK’s IPS Security Sector Reform (SSR) programme in MND(SE) </p>
<p>and its linkage to the shape and effectiveness of MNF&#8209;I national policing policy in </p>
<p>Baghdad”.</p>
<p>931</p>
<p> There were 12 areas specifically highlighted, including the effectiveness </p>
<p>of IPS training, police officer and ArmorGroup contract management, IPAs and the </p>
<p>relationship between UK structures and those of the US and Iraq.</p>
<p><b>1007. </b> Sir Ronnie Flanagan visited Iraq between 20 and 24 November 2005 to conduct </p>
<p>an initial review of the UK policing effort in Iraq.</p>
<p>932</p>
<p> He submitted an interim report to </p>
<p>Dr Reid on 13 December, who briefed the DOP(I) on 15 December. </p>
<p><b>1008. </b> Sir Ronnie’s interim report identified:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no single strategy for SSR at a national level – he had </p>
<p>uncovered “references to at least four”, and “many of these” existed in </p>
<p>isolation of one another.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “a loss of corporacy and a disconnect with MNSTC&#8209;I and CPATT </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “biggest source of friction” between the military and UK police officers had </p>
<p>been the inconsistent restrictions on movements but “significant progress” had </p>
<p>been made during his visit to harmonise these, both operating on the basis of </p>
<p>military risk assessments (subject to FCO and ACPO confirmation).</p>
<p>933</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1009. </b> Sir Ronnie visited Iraq again from 3 to 8 January 2006 and submitted his final </p>
<p>report on 31 January.</p>
<p>934</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1010. </b> Sir Ronnie wrote that the original terms of reference had evolved into three </p>
<p>overarching issues:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The strategic direction and integration of the SSR (policing) effort;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The efficiency and effectiveness of the SSR (policing) effort, including the </p>
<p>Carabinieri, in MND(SE);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The effectiveness of the existing training arrangements.”</p>
<p><b>1011. </b> Sir Ronnie was “encouraged” to learn that since his previous visit “a broad </p>
<p>strategic plan” was now being prepared and that the “disconnect” he had identified </p>
<p>was “already becoming a thing of the past”. In MND(SE), he noted “a high level of </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation” between UK police officers and that SSR now accounted for 47 percent of </p>
<p>the military’s work. He added:</p>
<p>“Nevertheless tensions, both in theatre and within Whitehall, still exist over where </p>
<p>primacy for SSR (policing) effort rests. Put simply, the shift in thinking that should </p>
<p>have followed the assumption by MOD of primacy for SSR in Iraq has not permeated </p>
<p>all activity.”</p>
<p><b>1012. </b> Sir Ronnie made 17 recommendations, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqis should be encouraged to develop a robust vetting system for IPS </p>
<p>recruits as soon as possible and to take immediate action to “root out” corrupt </p>
<p>and sub&#8209;standard elements within the IPS. In progressing this the UK will need </p>
<p>to provide support and expert guidance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should encourage MNF&#8209;I to transfer responsibility for criminal and </p>
<p>counter&#8209;insurgency intelligence to CPATT.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For Iraq and future deployments, a senior police officer of Chief Superintendent </p>
<p>rank should be embedded within PJHQ.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK should use whatever influence is available to them to ensure </p>
<p>that the next Minister of the Interior has a sound appreciation of the scale of the </p>
<p>challenges and, moreover, is willing to take decisive action to address them.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>287</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US should be encouraged to allow the Iraqi Government lead responsibility </p>
<p>for the National Policing Plan. That should be led by the new Minister of Interior </p>
<p>in consultation with the 18 provincial Chiefs of Police. In progressing that, the </p>
<p>coalition must of course provide expert advice and guidance and perhaps the </p>
<p>suggested draft.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CPA&#8209;I’s successor should be re&#8209;deployed and should function within the </p>
<p>MND(SE) command structure where he or she will be able to direct the SSR </p>
<p>(policing) effort.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The judicial dimension should be fully integrated within the SSR effort.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Strategic Taskforce should be re&#8209;convened with the goal of creating a </p>
<p>genuine police expeditionary capability operating within a framework that </p>
<p>provides maximum support to overseas SSR (policing) deployments.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should exert its influence to further embed and encourage the concept </p>
<p>of joint operating between the IPS and the Iraqi Army in areas where the security </p>
<p>situation makes this appropriate. </p>
<p><b>1013. </b> Sir Ronnie Flanagan stated:</p>
<p>“In many respects the challenge facing us in Iraq appears more daunting from </p>
<p>London than it does in theatre. This I attribute to the inevitable difficulty that exists </p>
<p>in grasping some of the key contextual factors.” </p>
<p><b>1014. </b> Sir Ronnie wrote that his recent visit had given him “a greater appreciation” of </p>
<p>the significant threat from “rogue elements” in the Basra intelligence agencies and “pop </p>
<p>up battalions” that could jeopardise SSR if not addressed. He stated that “the ultimate </p>
<p>solution” rested with the MOI and that “the key to success” would be “the creation of </p>
<p>effective governance structures”. </p>
<p><b>1015. </b> Sir Ronnie concluded:</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding the reservations I have expressed about the quality of training, </p>
<p>intelligence and other factors that inhibit the SSR (policing) effort, Iraq is on the right </p>
<p>path and there is a good news story to be told. From an admittedly low base, Iraq’s </p>
<p>security forces are now recognisable as such and early signs of self&#8209;sufficiency are </p>
<p>becoming apparent … The UK can take pride in its contribution.” </p>
<p><b>1016. </b> A junior FCO official sent Dr Howells a copy of Sir Ronnie’s report on </p>
<p>17 February.</p>
<p>935</p>
<p> The note also enclosed a matrix listing each recommendation and the </p>
<p>department responsible for its progress alongside it, including an additional 16 “other </p>

<p><b>1017. </b> The Baghdad SSR Working Group met on 19 February to discuss Sir Ronnie’s </p>
<p>report.</p>
<p>936</p>
<p> The Group commented or identified action against all of recommendations, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how critical the MOI and its Minister would be in delivering change;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the practical difficulties encountered while trying to establish effective vetting </p>
<p>procedures which were constrained by a lack of resources;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the National Policing Plan needed to be written by the Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>not by the coalition; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that there were cost and duty of care issues in implementing Sir Ronnie’s </p>
<p>recommendation that recruits visited theatre.</p>
<p><b>1018. </b> A summary of the Baghdad SSR Committee on 27 April listed progress against </p>
<p>the six “Baghdad&#8209;related recommendations” from Sir Ronnie’s report.</p>
<p>937</p>
<p> Discussions </p>
<p>were ongoing with CPATT on how to implement those; those had been some difficulties </p>
<p>engaging “the right people at the right levels” and the National Policing Plan was “still too </p>
<p>military&#8209;dominated”. It was recorded that there were insufficient resources to undertake </p>
<p>an audit of training at that time. </p>
<p><b>1019. </b> On 16 May, Mr Patey wrote to Mr Stephen Pattison, FCO Director International </p>

<p> </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>1023. </b> On 8 March, Maj Gen Cooper reported:</p>
<p>“We have intelligence that the recidivists within the IPS have resumed their criminal </p>
<p>activity, and the population at large is beginning to question our commitment. Absent </p>
<p>buy&#8209;in from the MOI, I am clear about the need for us to press ahead unilaterally </p>
<p>with [Operation] CORRODE, before the IPS regress to a position from which they </p>
<p>cannot be redeemed.”</p>
<p>942</p>
<p><b>1024. </b> The following week, Maj Gen Cooper reported that Mr Jabr had given the “green </p>
<p>light” for MNF to continue with arrest operations under Op CORRODE.</p>
<p>943</p>
<p> He said </p>
<p>that the next target was a “relatively junior player”. Mr Jabr was also reported to have </p>
<p>endorsed plans to establish a new DIA based at Basra Air Station.</p>
<p><b>1025. </b> On 15 May, a junior official from PJHQ provided briefing to Mr Ingram about </p>
<p>IPS members detained by MND(SE) as part of Op CORRODE.</p>
<p>944</p>
<p> He stated that </p>
<p>Op CORRODE was established in conjunction with the MOI after the Jameat incident </p>
<p>on 19 September and aimed to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remove corrupt individuals in key positions of responsibility;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>replace those individuals with suitable personnel from outside Basra province; </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reform the remaining officers.</p>
<p><b>1026. </b> The official wrote that the operation had been constrained because of “problems </p>
<p>with political disengagement in Basra” and “nervousness amongst senior political figures </p>
<p>in Baghdad”. PJHQ assessed that there were currently ten policemen detained in </p>
<p>Shaibah, a military airfield seven miles southwest of Basra. They were likely to remain </p>
<p>at the facility “for the foreseeable future”, because the intelligence against detainees </p>
<p>was not admissible as evidence. Also, the detainees had connections which meant that </p>
<p>Basra judges would be reluctant to try them, or be susceptible to intimidation if they did </p>
<p>try them.</p>
<p><b>1027. </b> In his weekly report on 24 May, Maj Gen Cooper described two enemies in </p>
<p>Basra: rogue JAM and – “most dangerous” – the “corrupt IPS elements … which have </p>
<p>murdered so many Basrawis”.</p>
<p>945</p>
<p> He wrote that he needed political cover from the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to tackle IPS reform and would be grateful for UK political pressure.</p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Maj Gen Cooper’s report on 8 June stated that Op CORRODE had re&#8209;started </p>
<p>and, on 4 June, there had been the first successful targeting and detention of a serving </p>
<p>Basra police officer for more than three months.</p>

<p>detention ops targeting IPS and N Basra leadership”. Maj Gen Cooper reported that a </p>
<p>total of three IPS officers had been detained within Op CORRODE since 17 May 2006.</p>
<p><b>1029. </b> The JIC’s Assessment of 9 June described the disbanding of the DIA as “remedial </p>
<p>action” resulting from “MNF pressure”.</p>
<p>947</p>
<p> However, the JIC stated that “the personnel </p>
<p>have been reassigned rather than sacked”.</p>
<p><b>1030. </b> This JIC Assessment considered whether the ISF was “fit for duty”. It reported:</p>
<p>“The ISF in the South reflect the deep&#8209;rooted local tribal and political influences. </p>
<p>The Army’s 10th</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Division in MND(SE) is rated by the MNF as increasingly effective. </p>
<p>It has performed basic tasks such as patrols and static guard duties successfully, </p>
<p>but remains untested in counter&#8209;insurgency operations without MNF support. The </p>
<p>Police in the South are a cause for much greater concern. Many local Police officers, </p>
<p>in Basra and Maysan in particular, remain loyal to their political faction or militia </p>
<p>rather than to formal command structures. Both Badr and JAM retain support among </p>
<p>the ISF in different parts of the South. We judge that these divided loyalties would </p>
<p>affect the ability and willingness of the Police to cope in the event of an intensified </p>
<p>campaign of violence by Shia militias against the MNF, or fighting between Shia </p>
<p>factions … Baghdad’s central institutions have been unable to exert any control over </p>
<p>the police in Basra.” </p>
<p><b>Iraqi Navy progress</b></p>
<p>On 9 June 2006, a JIC Assessment stated that, by 1 May, 800 Navy personnel had been </p>
<p>“trained and equipped”, increasing from 750 on 4 October 2005.</p>
<p>948</p>
<p>In September, the Iraqi Navy transferred to Iraqi control, under the command and control </p>
<p>of the Joint Headquarters.</p>
<p>949</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In November, the Private Secretary to Mr Des Browne, Defence Secretary from May 2006, </p>
<p>briefed No.10 officials that progress on the Iraqi Navy had “lost early momentum due </p>
<p>to failure of the Iraqi procurement process” but stated that contracts had recently been </p>
<p>awarded and that the Iraqi Navy had plans to fund and build critical infrastructure during </p>
<p>2007.</p>
<p>950</p>
<p> He concluded: “this momentum must be sustained”. </p>
<p>On 6 September, an Independent Commission reported to Congress its conclusion that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Navy is small and its current fleet is insufficient to execute its mission. </p>
<p>However, it is making substantive progress in this early stage of development: it has </p>
<p>a well&#8209;thought&#8209;out growth plan, which it is successfully executing. Its maturation is </p>
<p>hampered by the [Iraqi] Ministry of Defence’s understandable focus on ground forces </p>
<p>and counterinsurgency operations, as well as by bureaucratic inefficiency. The Iraqi </p>

<p>18 to 22 June.</p>
<p>953</p>
<p> His Assistant Private Secretary recorded that Mr Jawad Boulani, the </p>
<p>new Minister of the Interior, told Mr Browne he was very clear about the need to reform </p>
<p>the police, particularly in Basra.</p>
<p><b>1032. </b> Major General Muhammed Latif, the Commander of the 10th Division, had told </p>
<p>Mr Browne that there were 15,000 police in Basra, but you could never find them on the </p>
<p>streets. If necessary, he was prepared to put a soldier in every police car to force them </p>
<p>to do their jobs. They failed to carry out even the most perfunctory investigations into </p>
<p>murders. Maj Gen Latif had started to use his own intelligence officers to follow up cases </p>
<p>and monitor police progress. When his staff asked questions about inaction, the police </p>
<p>would say that murders were “big boys’ issues”, usually a reference to the specialist </p>
<p>police organisations that Mr Boulani sought to disband.</p>
<p><b>1033. </b> During a meeting with UK representatives, Mr Browne was told by the police </p>
<p>advisor that “we [the UK] had originally set our sights too high; teaching forensics </p>
<p>instead of the basics”. Adjustments had now been made and the programme seemed to </p>
<p>be working well. The police advisor rejected the outright criticism from Maj Gen Latif and </p>
<p>said that there were “areas that had the start of an effective policing service”. </p>
<p><b>1034. </b> Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, CDS, briefed DOP(I) in July:</p>
<p>“… the main issue affecting the population was sectarian murders. To see progress </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>1037. </b> In a meeting of DOP(I) on 15 February, Mr Blair made clear that the UK should be </p>
<p>able clearly to demonstrate that the conditions for transition had been met, and that this </p>
<p>was as a result of the increasing capacity of the ISF.</p>
<p>955</p>
<p> The UK should not be handing </p>
<p>over for solely political reasons. </p>
<p><b>1038. </b> During a video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush on 22 February, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Houghton assessed that there had been good progress with the ISF in the </p>
<p>South which should allow security transfer in Maysan and Muthanna provinces by late </p>
<p>spring.</p>
<p>956</p>
<p> He assessed that Basra was “less promising, given the collusion between </p>
<p>police and militia, aided by local politicians” and that arrests of police “rapidly became </p>
<p>confrontations over political and sovereignty issues”.</p>
<p><b>1039. </b> On 9 March, Dr Reid wrote to Mr Blair explaining that, as a result of the latest </p>
<p>Force Level Review, troop levels would be reduced in May 2006, from approximately </p>
<p>8,000 to around 7,200 (see Section 9.4).</p>
<p>957</p>
<p> That reduction was made possible because </p>
<p>of the “completion of various Security Sector Reform tasks, a reduction in the support </p>
<p>levels for those tasks, and recent efficiency measures in theatre”. </p>
<p><b>1040. </b> In his statement to the House of Commons on 13 March, Dr Reid stated that the </p>
<p>completed tasks included training of trainers and Iraqi troops being capable of guarding </p>
<p>their own establishments.</p>
<p>958</p>
<p><b>1041. </b> On 15 March, a JIC Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi security forces [in Southern Iraq] can cope with the low level of threat </p>
<p>posed by the Sunni Arab nationalist insurgents and jihadists. Their readiness to deal </p>
<p>with the activities of Shia extremists or intra&#8209;Shia violence is more uncertain. Army </p>
<p>command, control and logistics capabilities are all still developing, making major </p>
<p>operations without MNF support difficult. The police are a greater concern: they have </p>
<p>multiple loyalties and have taken sides in intra&#8209;Shia clashes. A minority of police, </p>
<p>particularly in Basra, is involved in attacks on the MNF, the assassination of Sunnis </p>
<p>and organised crime.”</p>
<p>959</p>
<p><b>1042. </b> On 20 April, Mr Robin Lamb, Consul General in Basra, provided an assessment </p>
<p>of the security situation in Basra and its impact on the ability for UK civilian staff to </p>
<p>operate effectively (see Section 15.1).</p>
<p>960</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“Our LE [locally employed] staff regard the Iraqi Police Service as at best ineffective, </p>
<p>and at worst complicit in the assassinations. We would support that assessment.”</p>

<p><b>Policing reviews: ACC Barton and a Strategic Task Force</b></p>
<p><b>1043. </b> Acting ACC Dick Barton took over from DCC Smith as Chief Police Adviser&#8209;Iraq </p>
<p>on 27 March 2006 and was based in Basra (as opposed to Baghdad) in line with </p>
<p>Sir Ronnie’s recommendation described earlier in this Section.</p>
<p>961</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1044. </b> For his first task, ACC Barton was commissioned by the FCO to conduct a review </p>
<p>of the UK police mission in Iraq, focusing on three main areas: strategic priorities, </p>
<p>personnel structure of UK police in Iraq and “other work required (in support of Strategic </p>
<p>Priorities)”.</p>
<p>962</p>
<p><b>1045. </b> ACC Barton’s review was completed on 20 April and sought “to avoid replicating </p>
<p>areas already covered” by Sir Ronnie’s review four months earlier. He wrote that his </p>
<p>“review theme” was to “keep it basic”, stating that basic principles sat under many </p>
<p>complex policing issues. He highlighted three strategic priorities: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The mission must focus on building links with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The mission must be engaged in developing the new Internal Affairs, Major </p>
<p>Crime [Unit] and National Information and Investigation Agency (NIIA).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The mission must identify a realistic working model which facilitates draw&#8209;down </p>
<p>and eventual complete handover to the Iraqi Police Service.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1046. </b> ACC Barton made 12 recommendations for change in the way the UK police </p>
<p>mission was staffed including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>creating an Assistant Chief Police Adviser post with a focus on major crime and </p>
<p>criminal justice;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>creating a post to focus on developing an effective Internal Affairs capability, </p>
<p>warning that overt corruption in the police was “crippling”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reducing the number of contracted police officers; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>designating a Senior Police Adviser at Chief Superintendent level to be </p>
<p>territorial lead for Baghdad now that the CPA&#8209;I role had relocated.</p>
<p><b>1047. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Charles Clarke, Home Secretary, on 17 October 2005 </p>
<p>about findings from a Strategic Task Force established to “take a fresh look” at how </p>
<p>the UK contributed to international operations.</p>
<p>963</p>
<p> Mr Straw wrote that assisting in </p>
<p>international missions was “vital” for the UK’s foreign policy priorities and also created </p>
<p>“direct operational benefits” for the UK when officers returned with experience of </p>
<p>“working in the field”.</p>
<p><b>1048. </b> The Strategic Task Force assessed that there was no need to increase the overall </p>
<p>numbers provided by the UK, but suggested increasing the proportion of senior officers </p>

<p>and those with specialist skills. It proposed that “more use” was made of police staff. The </p>
<p>Task Force also advised ensuring that the spread of officers was more evenly distributed </p>
<p>across the forces (meaning a reduction in PSNI officers), and that the transition should </p>
<p>be made easier for returning officers by guaranteeing interviews for posts for which they </p>
<p>are qualified. </p>
<p><b>1049. </b> On 4 May 2006, Mr Howard submitted a draft response for Dr John Reid, who </p>
<p>became the Home Secretary on 5 May 2006, to send to Mr Straw.</p>
<p>964</p>
<p> Mr Howard said the </p>
<p>draft emphasised that “recent operational experience ha[d] demonstrated the need for </p>
<p>a robust expeditionary policing capability, ideally acting as part of an international force” </p>
<p>but also made clear that the matter was “constrained by issues that can only be resolved </p>
<p>by the police itself.”</p>
<p><b>1050. </b> Mr Patey wrote to Mr Pattison on 16 May, highlighting concerns that “our effort on </p>
<p>SSR and the Rule of Law in Iraq will suffer if we do not get staffing of our policing effort </p>
<p>right”.</p>
<p>965</p>
<p> Mr Patey noted that there was a risk the UK would “continue to lose credibility </p>
<p>in the eyes of the US as a key partner” if that issue could not be addressed, citing </p>
<p>the frequent turnover of staff (recommending tours of more than one year) and gaps </p>
<p>between posting of senior staff as contributing to problems. He acknowledged that those </p>
<p>were manifestations of a wider problem in recruiting, and that there was “little benefit to </p>
<p>the police service for their good police officers to deploy to Iraq” requiring “more radical </p>
<p>solutions … In the short and longer term”. The letter concluded by recommending that </p>
<p>the FCO “should engage with the new Home Secretary, about the need for appropriate </p>
<p>career and reward packages to be in place for deployed officers and the need for all </p>
<p>police services to contribute to the effort”.</p>
<p><b>1051. </b> Mr Pattison’s reply agreed with the premise that “good quality police staffing is </p>
<p>central to delivery of the UK’s objectives in Iraq” but noted that that needed to be seen </p>
<p>in the wider context, in particular that all UK police secondees were volunteers.</p>

<p> He suggested a strategy that involved pressing </p>

<p>had been a “driving force” as Deputy Chair of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Committee and had </p>

<p>their ministries and make them work;</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>Disbanding the militias … some can be integrated in the ISF, but others will </p>
<p>need to be demobilised and retrained.</p>
<p>There will need to be a major DDR and jobs package which we should try to get the </p>
<p>international community involved in. Even if we do, this is a massive task. Militias </p>
<p>abound – from personal protection, to Badr and JAM, through to the Facilities </p>

<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Drawing up a timetable with conditions setting out the potential path to MNF </p>
<p>withdrawal. This should address the desire of Iraqis for clarity over two </p>
<p>issues: that the MNF will stay until Iraqi security forces are capable of acting </p>
<p>independently; and that the MNF will go once that has been achieved. Any </p>
<p>timetable should include dates, but each one should be conditional on ISF </p>
<p>build&#8209;up of capability and overall violence levels … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need to make sure that Iraqi forces really are capable of dealing with the </p>
<p>threat, including from AQ … The Prime Minister heard a number of disquieting </p>
<p>comments on this score from Iraqis and others. We therefore need a candid </p>
<p>analysis of the gap between current capabilities and future requirements … and </p>
<p>a plan for closing the gap … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Turning around the situation in Basra … This will require … a larger role and </p>

<p>“The numbers used by the MNF were suspect as they did not take account of </p>

<p>but the US was cautious”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD was working on a “robust assessment of where things stood” with </p>
<p>the ISF.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Gen Casey was preparing a Security Plan for Basra (described later in this </p>
<p>Section).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>GOC MND(SE) “intended to start detention operations in the next few days, and </p>
<p>was working to increase the Iraqi face on security using the Iraqi Army”. The </p>
<p>Iraqis were currently participating in 40 percent of all patrols in Basra.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>1063. </b> On 7 June, the MOD submitted its assessment of the ISF’s progress to the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>978</p>
<p> Some of the key points were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The programme was on target to complete by December 2006 with 80 percent </p>
<p>of the ISF trained and equipped (less the forces in Anbar province and the </p>
<p>Air Force and Navy capability). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Higher&#8209;level command and control, logistics, equipment husbandry and </p>
<p>intelligence remained immature, but “significant improvement” was expected </p>
<p>during 2006. MND(SE) had “some of the same issues” but they were “less </p>
<p>acute” with 10th Division having received 97 percent of its “critical items”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Of the Iraqi Army battalions and brigade/divisional headquarters, 50 percent </p>
<p>were capable of planning, executing and sustaining counter&#8209;insurgency </p>
<p>operations. The Iraqi people held the Iraqi Army “generally in high regard”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The police were “some way behind” but “significant progress” was expected by </p>
<p>the end of the year. Their effectiveness rested on their credibility with the Iraqi </p>
<p>people, which was “increasing but remain[ed] an issue”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Equipment shortfalls in the police were attributed to MOI “over&#8209;recruiting” police </p>
<p>forces, by “possibly 9,000 to 10,000 … in the South alone”. That was “reportedly </p>
<p>to combat unemployment”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISF in MND(SE) should be capable of managing the threat that they will </p>
<p>face but could be quickly undermined by poor leadership.” The UK had trained </p>
<p>22,000 IPS officers out of an agreed number of 29,000. </p>
<p><b>1064. </b> On the Basra Security Plan, the MOD wrote that “in seeking efficiencies to </p>
<p>resource the new initiatives proposed in the Basra paper, it would be counter&#8209;productive </p>
<p>to disrupt established projects in MND(SE) … to then re&#8209;invest in the same sectors”. The </p>
<p>FCO was exploring options to reduce the UK’s commitment to the Jordan International </p>
<p>Police Training College, which had the potential to save £3.5m “with minimal impact </p>
<p>upon ISF capacity&#8209;building” although it “may meet with opposition in US quarters”.</p>
<p><b>1065. </b> Writing about the way ahead, the MOD report stated:</p>
<p>“As the Iraqi security forces mature, Iraq’s partners will need to put additional </p>
<p>resources into areas such as the judiciary and courts which have been relatively </p>
<p>neglected but which are critical to enforcing law and order as security forces. We </p>
<p>need to caution against further growth in the size of the ISF whose size/shape has </p>
<p>been designed to be affordable in the long run …</p>
<p>“On the whole, the advice of the UK personnel is appreciated by not only the US, </p>
<p>but more importantly the Iraqis. We must build on this influence, without negating </p>
<p>the current good work that is being planned and will soon be implemented in </p>

<p><b>Iraqi Air Force progress</b></p>
<p>A Report by the Independent Commission on the Security Forces in Iraq published on </p>
<p>6 September 2007 stated that the Iraqi Air Force had a “meagre beginning and late </p>
<p>start” compared with the Iraqi Army.</p>
<p>979</p>
<p> Development of the Iraqi Air Force was led by the </p>
<p>Coalition Air Force Transition Team (CAFTT) which was part of MNSTC&#8209;I. </p>
<p>In June 2004, Maj Gen Houghton recorded that 148 air force personnel were in training.</p>
<p>980</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Initially, the force would be 500 strong. An agreement had been established for the </p>
<p>transfer of air transport and helicopters from Jordan.</p>
<p>In July 2005, Lt Gen Brims reported that it was “a long term project” and that there were </p>
<p>“insufficient funds to even forecast when a plan might be considered”.</p>
<p>981</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 7 June 2006, the MOD produced an update on ISF progress.</p>
<p>982</p>
<p> On the Iraqi Air Force, </p>
<p>progress had been made in the adoption of new structures and procedures. However, </p>
<p>operational tasks were limited to reconnaissance and air transport, and equipment </p>
<p>procurement had proved a challenge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Initial recruits to the Iraqi Air Force were people who had served in the Air Force prior to </p>
<p>the invasion.</p>
<p>983</p>
<p>The main objectives of the Iraqi Air Force were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to organise, train and equip air operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to conduct day/night/all&#8209;weather counter&#8209;insurgency operations; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to provide homeland capabilities to the Government of Iraq.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Air Force operated out of four bases:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Muthanna Air Base which operated the Air Force’s fixed wing capability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Taji Air Base which housed an interim Air Force Academy as well as most of the </p>
<p>rotary wing assets; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra and Kirkuk Air Bases which focused on intelligence, surveillance and </p>
<p>reconnaissance capabilities.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>“The new government will take time to agree critical strategic security policy. Even </p>
<p>if the Ministers of Defence and Interior prove capable and non&#8209;partisan, robust </p>
<p>administrative capacity in these Ministries will take time to build. We judge there is </p>
<p>likely to be only limited progress during the rest of this year in the face of a virulent </p>
<p>insurgency and continuing sectarian violence. The need to absorb Shia militias will </p>
<p>add to the challenges and could exacerbate sectarian tensions; but a failure to do </p>
<p>so would undermine the authority of the government.”</p>

<p>301</p>
<p><b>1069. </b> On 17 July, Lt Gen Fry reported that MNSTC&#8209;I had made recommendations for </p>
<p>changes to the ISF structures following concerns expressed by Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>about the ISF’s ability to tackle the current security situation.</p>
<p>989</p>
<p> Mr Maliki was reported </p>
<p>to have:</p>
<p>“… little confidence in the police and [he] thinks that the army should be greatly </p>
<p>expanded. The view from MNF&#8209;I and MNSTC&#8209;I is that the currently planned ISF </p>
<p>force structure is about the right size and properly balanced between the [Iraqi] </p>
<p>MOD and the MOI.” </p>
<p><b>1070. </b> The main changes proposed were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Army should have a second Divisional HQ in Baghdad; one additional </p>
<p>brigade in each of Diyala and Anbar; two additional battalions for 10th Division </p>
<p>in Basra; an additional Special Operational battalion in Baghdad plus 400 </p>
<p>armoured vehicles and a mobile armoured strike force.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The National Police should have a “near&#8209;term reconstitution, to restore </p>
<p>standards of training, discipline and leadership, and a two&#8209;year plan to </p>
<p>reorganise and retrain them so that they evolve into a Carabinieri/gendarmerie </p>
<p>force”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To bring together existing units into a rapid response national counter&#8209;terror </p>
<p>force overseen by the IMOD and a national strike force comprising a </p>
<p>mechanised brigade, a Special Forces commando battalion and a National </p>
<p>Police brigade. </p>
<p><b>1071. </b> Lt Gen Fry reported that the key theme of the recommendations was “a better </p>
<p>not bigger ISF, within budget” and that “we are close to an agreed ISF size and shape, </p>
<p>revised in the light of experience to address the developing operational challenges”. </p>

<p>but does not feel he has sufficient forces at his disposal or cover within his political </p>
<p>circles to do so whilst terrorism and the insurgency show no signs of abating. We </p>
<p>are in a Catch 22; those insurgents who might consider joining the political process </p>
<p>are unlikely to do so until the militias have been disbanded or disarmed. As long </p>
<p>as AQ&#8209;I and other groups are bombing Shia markets and mosques the militias will </p>
<p>continue to pose as a better security option than the ISF and to assuage the desire </p>

<p>be achieved by the end of the year. It should be possible to ensure that the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government has a near monopoly of force by the time the coalition withdraws the </p>
<p>bulk of our forces. Our ability to help them transform the National Police into a </p>

<p><b>1073. </b> On 27 July, the Iraq Strategy Group discussed whether there was “any better </p>

<p>991</p>
<p> It agreed with the MNSTC&#8209;I view that they “should </p>
<p>not give up on the Iraqi Police, notwithstanding the obvious problems”; that MOI reform </p>
<p>remained a critical and urgent task; and that the Iraqi Army’s ranks should be overfilled </p>
<p>to bring them closer to 100 percent effective strength. </p>
<p>DEALING WITH THE MILITIAS</p>
<p><b>1074. </b> Gen Jackson visited Iraq from 15 to 18 May 2006.</p>
<p>992</p>
<p> On the various unofficial and </p>
<p>semi&#8209;official armed groups, he said:</p>
<p>“Although not wholly in the purview of SSR, these armed groupings must either be </p>
<p>disbanded or integrated into the national security structure. The militias pose by far </p>
<p>the hardest challenge and before there is any chance of DDR or integration into </p>
<p>the ISF, formal political engagement with the associated political leaders of these </p>
<p>groups is required: a priority task for the new government.”</p>
<p><b>1075. </b> When they met on 22 May, Mr Blair asked Prime Minister Maliki how the issue </p>
<p>of militias could be best addressed.</p>
<p>993</p>
<p> Mr Maliki “favoured extensive dialogue, including </p>
<p>with extremists, so long as they had not shed Iraqi blood”; terrorists should “be dealt </p>
<p>with forcefully”. There was “a consensus on militias, which all parties had now agreed </p>
<p>to disband” but it would be necessary to find alternative employment for current militia </p>
<p>members.</p>
<p><b>1076. </b> Mr Maliki also said that he recognised the importance of the Ministries of Interior </p>
<p>and Defence being seen to be independent and non&#8209;sectarian. He hoped to have soon </p>

<p>Minister had some sympathy with the view of Maliki and the US that we should </p>
<p>consider increasing the size of the Iraqi Army. The countervailing argument was that </p>
<p>it was the ability to use troops available effectively that was the real constraint on </p>
<p>the ISF’s effectiveness. In either case, there was a political argument for absorbing </p>
<p>some of the militia forces into the ISF. The US was exploring the options but the </p>

<p>995</p>
<p> Mr Blair judged that “overcoming the evident lack of engagement against </p>
<p>the militias by the Iraqi Government and security forces is a major strategic task”. As </p>
<p>well as continuing to press the Iraqi Government to take action, it was important for the </p>
<p>UK to “have a clearer view of what action is required, to complement and make up for </p>
<p>the shortcomings of the current Baghdad and Basra security plans”. In addition, he was </p>
<p>concerned that the evidence demonstrated that the ISF were not as capable as had </p>
<p>previously been assessed. No.10 asked for advice on addressing both of those issues. </p>
<p><b>1079. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary replied to No.10 suggesting that the UK should </p>

<p>“Violence in Iraq is part of a vicious circle: deteriorating security has led to a </p>
<p>proliferation of militias, in turn fuelling further violence. Prime Minister Maliki is […] </p>
<p>unable to confront the militias, fearing a violent backlash that would threaten the </p>
<p>break&#8209;up of the Shia political coalition (the UIA). Without significant progress on the </p>
<p>National Reconciliation Plan and a sustained improvement in the security situation </p>
<p>there will continue to be little appetite for the MNF plan for the Disarmament, </p>
<p>Demobilisation and Reintegration of the Iraqi militias.</p>
<p>“Many militias are sectarian based and competing with the Iraqi state’s security </p>
<p>forces to provide security and protection for their own communities. They are </p>
<p>undermining government authority. Some elements are engaged in violent attacks </p>
<p>against their political and sectarian opponents and coalition forces. In some cases, </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>1083. </b> A US Report to Congress on 30 November stated that, in early October, Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki had said that political parties should eliminate their militias or leave the </p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>1001</p>
<p> It added:</p>
<p>“However, personnel with sectarian agendas remain within key ministries, especially </p>
<p>the Ministry of Interior. In addition, rivalries for the control of key resources and the </p>
<p>central government’s limited influence outside Baghdad undermine the Government </p>
<p>of Iraq’s ability to disband the militias … </p>
<p>“Despite these legal and political prohibitions, militias and other small armed groups </p>
<p>operate openly, often with popular support, but outside formal public security </p>
<p>structures. These militias provide an element of protection for the populace, </p>
<p>generally on a sectarian or political basis. This is especially true in areas where </p>
<p>there is a perception that the Government of Iraq is unwilling or unable to provide </p>
<p>effective security for the population. Some militias also act as the security arm of </p>
<p>an organisation devoted to social relief and welfare, lending these armed groups </p>
<p>further legitimacy. Their continued existence challenges the legitimacy of the </p>
<p>constitutional government and provides a conduit for foreign interference. Controlling </p>
<p>and eventually eliminating militias is essential to meeting Iraq’s near&#8209; and long&#8209;term </p>
<p>security requirements.”</p>
<p><b>Transition to Iraqi control of security begins</b></p>
<p><b>1084. </b> On 1 September, an eGram from the British Embassy Baghdad reported an </p>
<p>“important step psychologically” for the Iraqi military: the Iraqi Ground Forces Command </p>
<p>and IMOD would commence “a staggered handover” of command and control functions </p>
<p>from MNF&#8209;I on 3 September.</p>
<p>1002</p>
<p> It would begin with the 8th Division and other divisions </p>
<p>would follow at a rate of one every two weeks until the end of the year. The transfer </p>
<p>of 10th Division was planned for January 2007and the final transfer, of the Ramadi </p>
<p>Division, was planned for April. MNF&#8209;I forces were expected to retain responsibility for </p>
<p>logistical support and development. </p>
<p><b>1085. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported that “while the assumption of </p>
<p>responsibility looks gradual and sensibly phased, in reality the pace will be demanding to </p>
<p>both MNF&#8209;I and the IGFC [Iraqi Ground Forces Command]”. As “life support and logistics </p>
<p>capabilities” were “developing at their own, much slower, pace”, it predicted that “IA </p>
<p>Divisions will remain dependent on MNF&#8209;I for some time to come”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>Ethno&#8209;sectarian diversity in the Iraqi Ministry of Defence</b></p>
<p>In its Reports to Congress, the US DoD monitored ethno&#8209;sectarian diversity in the </p>
<p>IMOD.</p>
<p>1003</p>
<p> On 26 May 2006, it stated that the leadership of the IMOD, selected with </p>
<p>MNSTC&#8209;I co&#8209;ordination, was majority Sunni. </p>
<p>On 29 August, Sunnis and Kurds were over&#8209;represented, in relation to the population, </p>
<p>at higher command levels, though Shia commanders held the majority of command </p>
<p>positions.</p>
<p>1004</p>
<p> That was reported to reflect the requirement for military experience, which </p>
<p>Sunnis had obtained in the Iraqi Army before the invasion and Kurds had obtained through </p>
<p>years of experience in the Peshmerga.</p>
<p>The composition of Iraqi Army divisions could be divided into two groups. The nationally </p>
<p>recruited divisions (those with an odd number) were roughly representative of the </p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>1005</p>
<p> The even numbered divisions, which had been recruited locally, initially as </p>
<p>ICDC personnel then ING, were more homogenous. </p>
<p>Describing the composition of Iraqi Army divisions, the JIC recorded that “of the 10 Army </p>
<p>divisions, three are heavily Shia (over 90 percent), a further three are Shia&#8209;dominated, two </p>
<p>are mostly Kurdish and one is relatively mixed, which is unsurprising given that five are </p>
<p>based on National Guard divisions recruited locally in 2003. Among the top three senior </p>
<p>Army officer grades, representation broadly reflects the national confessional breakdown: </p>
<p>Sunnis 20 percent; Shia about 50&#8209;60 percent; the Kurds 20&#8209;30 percent.”</p>
<p>1006</p>
<p>To increase diversity in the odd numbered divisions, the intent was for replacements from </p>
<p>a national recruiting pool to join these units.</p>
<p>1007</p>
<p> Further army recruitment was done at the </p>
<p>national level with IMOD policy strictly prohibiting unit commanders from hiring their own </p>
<p>personnel and clearly requiring enlisted and commissioned personnel to attend national </p>
<p>training schools to receive certification of their rank and duty speciality.</p>
<p>1008</p>
<p><b>1086. </b> On 3 November, the British Embassy Baghdad reported that a video conference </p>
<p>between President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki had resulted in agreement to </p>
<p>accelerate the pace of training the ISF, their assuming command and control and the </p>
<p>transfer of security responsibility to the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p>1009</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1087. </b> A High Level Working Group with three sub&#8209;committees was established to </p>

<p><b>1089. </b> Lt Gen Fry submitted his End of Tour Report on 28 August.</p>

<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“The key indices of the development of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are regularly </p>

<p>the IA, will require an additional 52,000 soldiers to be trained, and in the IPS, will </p>
<p>require the process of internal reform to be seen through. But these are regarded </p>
<p>as running repairs to structures which are fundamentally sound in design and </p>
<p>institutionally well&#8209;conceived. Given this positive background, the successive IA </p>
<p>battalions which have disintegrated when placed under orders or actually deployed </p>
<p>to operations outside their divisional area is disappointing. Disappointing, but </p>
<p>probably not surprising. The month on month increase of numbers trained conceals </p>
<p>organisations which remain very immature … Seen from MNSTC&#8209;I, this is entirely </p>

<p>Minister Maliki is attempting to address some of the problems: diplomatic reporting </p>

<p><b>1092. </b> A further JIC Assessment on 24 November stated: </p>
<p>“The UIA [United Iraqi Alliance] recognises the need to build ISF capabilities, but </p>
<p>ISF credibility as impartial, national forces is being damaged by the main Shia </p>
<p>factions entrenching their influence – and in some cases control – over state </p>
<p>security structures. […] SCIRI’s Badr Organisation is the most organised, placing its </p>
<p>members in important positions within the Ministries […]. The Jaysh al Mahdi (JAM), </p>
<p>largely under the control of Sadr, has been less systematic, but controls the police in </p>
<p>many Shia areas through infiltration and intimidation. The relative influence of SCIRI/</p>
<p>Badr and JAM in the ISF varies across the Shia areas of central and southern Iraq; </p>
<p>their rivalry has led to serious violence in places, most recently in al&#8209;Amara. </p>
<p>“Shia militias provide protection and leverage to Shia political parties. In a climate </p>
<p>of poor security and political uncertainty, we see no prospect that SCIRI/Badr, Sadr/</p>
<p>JAM and others will willingly give up their power. Maliki has made some attempts to </p>
<p>get rid of sectarian elements within the ISF […]. He says he is pursuing a strategy </p>
<p>with the Sadrists to bind them more tightly into the political process while gathering </p>
<p>the necessary political backing to take tough action against renegade JAM elements. </p>
<p>[…] By aligning himself with the Sadrists, Maliki risks alienating SCIRI/Badr.”</p>
<p>1012</p>
<p><b>Enabling the police to tackle crime</b></p>
<p>A Report to Congress on 30 November 2006 stated that the MOI’s emphasis on </p>
<p>tactical skills meant that little resource was left for training for or conducting criminal </p>
<p>investigations.</p>
<p>1013</p>
<p> As a result, corruption and smuggling were becoming more organised </p>
<p>and entrenched. The CPATT was seeking to address that by strengthening the Iraqi </p>
<p>Major Crimes Task Force and the Major Crimes Unit. In addition, there were discussions </p>
<p>between the MOI and MNSTC&#8209;I about improving Iraq’s forensic investigative capabilities </p>
<p>by adding several thousand forensic specialists to the police forces.</p>
<p>In November 2006, the British Embassy Baghdad produced a ‘Police Forward Look’ that </p>
<p>suggested the UK’s aim was to move its “assistance increasingly to higher&#8209;level mentoring </p>
<p>and support”.</p>
<p>1014</p>
<p> It identified seven work strands in Baghdad, a number of which were </p>
<p>expected to transfer to an Iraqi lead during 2007:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>TIPS – CPATT was likely to move the hotline to the MOI “in the next few </p>
<p>months”. Without a significant increase in resources, the UK contribution </p>
<p>(ArmorGroup) was judged to be unsustainable and it was recommended that it </p>
<p>be drawn down by March 2007 “at the latest”. Despite being “the UK’s biggest </p>
<p>success story”, it “was not part of our original remit”. TIPS is described earlier in </p>
<p>this Section in the Box, ‘TIPS hotline’.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Forensics – the Baghdad laboratory and training academy were open </p>
<p>with “significant” support from UK police officers and ArmorGroup. They </p>
<p>aimed to be completely Iraqi&#8209;led by the end of 2007; the Basra equivalent was </p>
<p>“now the priority”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>CPATT slots – to continue “for as long as is required”. British officers held two </p>
<p>positions in CPATT and a further two were desired over the next year.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hostage affairs – one officer whose role was to provide links into the </p>
<p>Hostage Working Group and other US and MNF&#8209;I hostage recovery groups. It </p>
<p>was a post that the UK could not “manage without” and any departing officer </p>
<p>should be replaced “as rapidly as possible with another police officer from the </p>
<p>UK with the relevant skill set”. The role was described as “not a heavily loaded </p>
<p>slot until hostage issues arise (as at present),</p>

<p>a heavy workload”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>310</p>
<p><b>1096. </b> A Cabinet Office paper on 13 June reported that the UK contribution to the </p>
<p>Ministerial Transition Teams was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOI: five international consultants (working in rotation) and two military officers. </p>
<p>The focus was on management and administrative capacity&#8209;building, including </p>
<p>strategic planning, improving administrative controls and accountability, clarifying </p>
<p>the legal and constitutional framework and human resource management.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IMOD: seven full&#8209;time advisers (MOD), including the Team Leader/Senior </p>
<p>Advisor who was responsible for directly advising the Minister. The team focused </p>
<p>on establishing a functional Secretariat, strengthening contracting procedures </p>
<p>and developing the Inspector General Group.</p>
<p>1019</p>
<p><b>1097. </b> A Report to Congress on 30 November stated that the MOI “was currently </p>
<p>assessed as being partly effective overall”.</p>
<p>1020</p>
<p> The MOI Transition Team had “just over </p>
<p>100 advisers”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Seven were from the US State Department.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Three were from the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>45 were from the US military.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“just over a third” were contractors (Military Professional Resources Inc).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The rest were non&#8209;US military and civilian personnel. </p>
<p><b>1098. </b> The IMOD Transition Team contained “just under 50 advisers”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The majority were contractors (Military Professional Resources Inc).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Six were US military personnel.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>12 were civilian advisers.</p>
<p><b>1099. </b> A “similarly scaled effort” was provided at Joint Headquarters, with US military </p>
<p>personnel making up roughly half and the rest split between US contractors and </p>
<p>personnel from coalition countries.</p>
<p><b>1100. </b> On 17 January 2007, the JIC repeated its concerns about the IMOD and the MOI </p>
<p>but did note some small signs of improvement in the Ministries, stating:</p>
<p>“The Ministerial Committee for National Security – chaired by [Prime Minister] </p>
<p>Maliki – is taking on more strategic planning. The MOD has benefited from MNF </p>
<p>engagement, performing better than the MOI. We judge that both ministries are </p>
<p>better able to direct their forces, albeit inconsistently. Some efforts have been made </p>
<p>to correct deep&#8209;seated problems. But the lack of united national political direction is </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1101. </b> Reports to Congress between November 2006 and March 2007 highlighted the </p>
<p>work being undertaken to tackle corruption in the MOI: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Internal Affairs: By the end of September 2006, 650 out of a total of around </p>
<p>1,000 MOI Internal Affairs officers had received specialised training. Training </p>
<p>for all personnel was expected to be completed by March 2007.</p>
<p>1022</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Quicklook”: A coalition&#8209;initiated, MOI&#8209;led police reform programme called </p>
<p>“Quicklook” was launched in December 2006.</p>
<p>1023</p>
<p> It aimed to review all aspects </p>
<p>of the performance and effectiveness of Iraqi police stations, beginning in </p>
<p>Baghdad. It comprised visits by representatives from Police Affairs, Internal </p>
<p>Affairs, Human Resources, Training and Administrative Directorates and was </p>
<p>complemented by the PTTs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dismissals: By August 2006, over 230,000 MOI employees had been screened </p>
<p>by the Iraqi Police Screening Service, against Ba’ath Party records and </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein&#8209;era criminal records.</p>
<p>1024</p>
<p> Possible positive hits numbered </p>
<p>5,300, leading to the dismissal of 74 personnel. By March 2007, there had been </p>
<p>1,228 dismissals with a further 2,143 dismissals pending.</p>
<p>1025</p>
<p> The screening </p>
<p>process was severely hampered by its inability to check for militia links; to </p>
<p>counter that, IPS recruits were required to take an oath of office denouncing </p>
<p>militia influence and pledging allegiance to Iraq’s Constitution.</p>

<p>emergencies.</p>
<p>1028</p>
<p> The planned number of officers was 25,000 but it was currently staffed </p>
<p>to “around 19,000”. Almost all National Police personnel were deployed in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Mr Asquith reported that the National Police’s first major deployment in June had been </p>
<p>“disappointing” and the second “somewhat better” but capability concerns remained. In </p>
<p>response, MNF&#8209;I and the MOI had initiated a comprehensive retraining and leadership </p>
<p>programme, resulting in a reshuffle that attracted local and international press coverage. </p>
<p>It was now in the second phase of retraining which was scheduled to run until September </p>
<p>2007. Officers would be retrained in police (as opposed to military) skills and “not released </p>
<p>for duties until they are able to meet the required standard”. </p>
<p>The MNF&#8209;I hoped that the retraining would also make “the NP [National Police] less </p>
<p>susceptible to the influence and infiltration of the militias” but Mr Asquith noted: “Indeed, </p>
<p>as so often with the ISF as a whole, leadership will be the key.”</p>
<p>While the National Police’s future role was undecided, the aim was to turn it into a “more </p>
<p>aggressive, responsive, paramilitary&#8209;style force over the next five years”, similar to </p>
<p>the Italian Carabinieri (National Military Police). Plans for regionalising the force were </p>
<p>dependent on the security situation in Baghdad, where the National Police would be </p>
<p>crucial in maintaining public order once the US drawdown began.</p>
<p>A JIC Assessment issued on 9 June 2006 reported:</p>
<p>“The more capable National Police, largely confined to the Baghdad region, have </p>
<p>provided effective support to MNF counter&#8209;insurgency operations. But we judge that </p>
<p>there are serious problems of corruption, criminality, and divided loyalties; elements </p>
<p>have taken part in sectarian attacks and are prone to Shia militia influence.”</p>
<p>1029</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Report to Congress on 30 November 2006 stated that while the National Police had </p>
<p>“proven useful in fighting the insurgency”, frequent allegations of abuse and other illegal </p>
<p>activities affected their credibility.</p>
<p>1030</p>
<p> A report in June 2007 stated that a four&#8209;phase </p>
<p>transformation programme began in October 2006 to reorient the National Police towards </p>
<p>police (as opposed to paramilitary) functions: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase I: “Quicklook” inspections to improve overall readiness.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase II: Standardised collective training, including added emphasis on human </p>
<p>rights, Rule of Law and police ethics. Extensive re&#8209;vetting of currently serving </p>
<p>officers, including ID checks, fingerprints, biometrics, a literacy test, and criminal </p>
<p>intelligence background checks. There was no specific screening for militia </p>
<p>affiliation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase III: An Italian led training plan based on the tactics, techniques and </p>
<p>procedures of the Carabinieri.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IV: Forward positioning to train on contingencies such as security for </p>

<p><b>1110. </b> On 29 November, Vice Admiral Charles Style, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments), told the Chiefs of Staff that the Forward Plan had received Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>approval over the weekend.</p>
<p>1042</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1111. </b> At DOP(I) on 7 December, Mr Browne reported that the security aspects of the </p>

<p>Basra police were being addressed.</p>
<p>1043</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1112. </b> The Inquiry has seen no other record of implementation against the Forward </p>
<p>Plan’s proposals. </p>
<p><b>Iraqi Air Force progress</b></p>
<p>In September 2007, the US Independent Commission on the Security Forces in Iraq (led </p>
<p>by General James L. Jones and described later in this Section) concluded:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Air Force’s relatively late establishment hampers its ability to provide </p>
<p>much&#8209;needed air support to ground operations. It is well designed as the air </p>
<p>component to the existing counterinsurgency effort, but not for the future needs </p>
<p>of a fully capable air force. Though limited by the availability of properly skilled </p>
<p>personnel, and by an inclination to value force size and acquisition over operational </p>
<p>effectiveness, it is nonetheless progressing at a promising rate during this formative </p>
<p>period.”</p>
<p>1044</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In September 2007, the Iraqi Air Force numbered 1,100 personnel with 45 aircraft.</p>
<p>1045</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were plans to increase personnel to 3,000 and for the number of aircraft to increase </p>
<p>to 80 by the end of 2007. Although the target of 3,000 personnel by the end of 2007 was </p>
<p>not met (there were only 1,200), long&#8209;term ambitions grew and plans were developed </p>
<p>to create an Iraqi Air Force of 12,000 personnel operating from 10 main bases and five </p>
<p>secondary bases. </p>
<p>By 31 May 2010, there were 5,600 personnel with 106 aircraft.</p>
<p>1046</p>
<p> The US assessed that </p>
<p>the “Minimum Essential Capability” required when US forces left in December 2011 was </p>
<p>“to establish the capability to support COIN operations and put in place the building blocks </p>
<p>necessary for the achievement of air sovereignty”.</p>
<p>1047</p>
<p> The US assessed in August 2010 </p>
<p>that the Iraqi Air Force was on track to meet this capability in all areas with the exception </p>
<p>of airspace control and fixed wing airlift.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>Focus on the Iraqi Army</b></p>
<p><b>1113. </b> On 29 October 2006, Mr Blair wrote a minute to staff in No.10 entitled ‘Iraq </p>
<p>Plan’.</p>
<p>1049</p>
<p> On ISF development he suggested:</p>
<p>“Rectify any weaknesses in training, equipment, pay and capacity of the Iraqi Army. </p>
<p>This should be built up as a major force which everyone knows is superior to any </p>
<p>other force. If we need to embed more of our officers to help, we should do it. We </p>
<p>need to make the Iraqi MOD effective in paying soldiers.</p>
<p>“A plan to pay off the worst aspects of the police, slim them down and change the </p>
<p>command and control. All this is easier to do in the context of the growing Army </p>
<p>power.”</p>
<p><b>1114. </b> In a Note to President Bush on 20 December, Mr Blair suggested three ways </p>
<p>in which to support Prime Minister Maliki, the first of which was to:</p>
<p>“… increase the speed of Iraqi Army command and control; training and equipment. </p>
<p>They are the one reasonably solid force structure the Iraqi Government has. All our </p>
<p>effort must be directed to building its capability.”</p>
<p>1050</p>
<p><b>1115. </b> On 6 January 2007, Prime Minister Maliki delivered what Mr Asquith described </p>
<p>as a “robust” speech at Iraq’s Army Day event.</p>
<p>1051</p>
<p> Mr Maliki called for armed forces that </p>
<p>were without political bias, cohesive in the national interest and protected from political </p>
<p>interference and militia. Mr Maliki said: </p>
<p>“We will not allow anybody to be an alternative to the state, whether the militias or </p>
<p>anybody else, regardless of their affiliations … We will confront them firmly.” </p>
<p><b>1116. </b> On 14 January 2007, Mr Blair met Mr Robert Gates, US Secretary of Defence.</p>
<p>1052</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair was recorded as stating that the Iraqis needed “at least one institution of power </p>
<p>which worked and supported the government”. His advice to the US was to place a high </p>
<p>value on building up Iraqi military capability.</p>
<p><b>Expansion of the Iraqi Security Forces</b></p>
<p><b>1117. </b> On 10 January 2007, President Bush announced a change of strategy for Iraq, </p>
<p>often referred to as “the Surge”.</p>
<p>1053</p>
<p> This is explained in more detail in Section 9.5. </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>As well as increasing the number of US and Iraqi troops in Baghdad, President Bush </p>
<p>announced a further focus on SSR:</p>
<p>“In keeping with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group [described in </p>
<p>Section 9.5], we will increase the embedding of American Advisors in Iraqi Army </p>
<p>units, and partner a coalition brigade with every Iraqi Army division. We will help </p>
<p>the Iraqis build a larger and better&#8209;equipped army, and we will accelerate the </p>
<p>training of Iraqi forces, which remains the essential US security mission in Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>1118. </b> On 17 January, the JIC produced an Assessment commissioned by the Iraq </p>
<p>Senior Officials Group.</p>
<p>1054</p>
<p> It stated: </p>
<p>“The success of new US plans will depend in part on the willingness of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to take on sectarian and political militias. Maliki will not take action </p>
<p>which risks breaking the Shia United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) and bringing down his </p>
<p>government. Only a small proportion of the ISF are currently both willing and able </p>
<p>to take on the Shia militias. In Baghdad the ISF will need support from MNF combat </p>
<p>units beyond 2007. Similar support will be required in the Sunni Arab heartlands if </p>
<p><i>de facto </i>control of large areas is not to pass to the insurgents.”</p>
<p><b>1119. </b> The US view of what was necessary to stabilise the situation in Iraq was reflected </p>
<p>in an assessment produced and published in January 2007 by the US National </p>
<p>Intelligence Council.</p>
<p>1055</p>
<p> On the ISF it stated:</p>
<p>“Despite real improvements, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) – particularly the Iraqi </p>
<p>police – will be hard pressed in the next 12&#8209;18 months to execute significantly </p>
<p>increased security responsibilities, and particularly to operate independently against </p>
<p>Shia militias with success. Sectarian divisions erode the dependability of many units, </p>
<p>many are hampered by personnel and equipment shortfalls, and a number of Iraqi </p>
<p>units have refused to serve outside of the areas where they were recruited.”</p>
<p><b>1120. </b> It also judged that if a rapid drawdown of coalition forces were to occur, the ISF </p>
<p>“would be unlikely to survive as a non&#8209;sectarian national institution”. </p>
<p><b>1121. </b> Mr Blair met General David Petraeus, the new Commander MNF&#8209;I on </p>
<p>6 February.</p>
<p>1056</p>
<p> They discussed Iraq’s security institutions and agreed that there were </p>
<p>still problems with funding, equipment and key enablers such as intelligence. They also </p>
<p>discussed the loyalty of the ISF and agreed that it was vital that the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>was able to impose its authority. Gen Petraeus agreed to lobby the Government on </p>
<p>matters such as a replacement commander for 10th Division if a solution was not </p>
<p>forthcoming. Mr Blair said that the UK would stay in Basra Palace and do more training </p>
<p>and mentoring. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>1122. </b> The DoD reported to Congress on 2 March that over 40 Joint Security Stations </p>
<p>in Baghdad would be established to “facilitate co&#8209;operation between coalition and Iraqi </p>
<p>Forces and to build trust and confidence with the local population”.</p>
<p>1057</p>
<p><b>1123. </b> The Report to Congress stated that the generation of MNSTC&#8209;I&#8209;agreed force </p>
<p>levels as mandated under the Petraeus Plan was considered complete. Both the IMOD </p>
<p>and the MOI had assumed control of most force generation tasks. </p>
<p><b>1124. </b> A letter from Mr Browne, circulated to DOP(I) members ahead of a meeting on </p>
<p>10 May, commented that “we must build on examples like Anbar, once considered all but </p>
<p>lost, where tribal leaders are now working with the coalition to drive out Al Qaida”.</p>
<p>1058</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1125. </b> Mr Browne said in discussion at the DOP(I) meeting that, in Anbar: “young Sunnis </p>
<p>were queuing up to join the Iraqi Security Forces”.</p>
<p>1059</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Machinery of Government under Mr Brown</b></p>
<p>Mr Gordon Brown took office as Prime Minister of the UK on 27 June 2007. In his initial </p>
<p>Cabinet reshuffle, he appointed Mr David Miliband as Foreign Secretary and Mr Douglas </p>
<p>Alexander as Development Secretary. Mr Des Browne remained as Defence Secretary </p>
<p>until 3 October 2008.</p>
<p>Mr Brown reorganised the structure of Cabinet Committees. As well as discussions </p>
<p>in Cabinet, Iraq business was formally addressed in the Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Sub&#8209;Committee of the Committee on National Security, International Relations and </p>
<p>Defence (NSID(OD)). An additional sub&#8209;committee specifically on Iraq (NSID(IR)) was </p>
<p>also established, but never met.</p>
<p><b>1126. </b> In June, a proposal agreed by Prime Minister Maliki established an additional </p>
<p>light infantry division, bringing the total planned force structure to 13</p>
<p>1060</p>
<p> divisions.</p>
<p>1061</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That expansion was funded by the Iraqi Government, bringing the total IMOD expansion </p>
<p>budget to US$950m. The development of the 14th Division which was to be raised in </p>
<p>Basra is described further in Box, ‘A new Iraqi Army division for Basra’, later in </p>
<p>this Section.</p>
<p><b>1127. </b> Commenting in his valedictory on 16 August 2007, Mr Asquith said:</p>
<p>“The surge has failed to create the space for politics to work because the military </p>
<p>(tactical) successes (local security structures loyal to the MNF) conflict directly with </p>
<p>the political objective (inclusive and integrated national Iraqi authority).”</p>

<p>319</p>
<p><b>1128. </b> Mr Asquith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Personally, I was sceptical that the surge would be effective and was unsure </p>
<p>whether the real objective of agreeing the local cease&#8209;fires with some of the Sunni </p>
<p>Arab areas’ tribal leaders was designed to minimise the casualties of US forces or </p>
<p>was really designed to build them into the political process. My suspicions were </p>
<p>that the first objective … was probably a more important one in the minds of the </p>
<p>military planners, and I was sceptical that they would be successful in persuading, </p>
<p>particularly the Sunni Arab tribal leaders, to be loyal to a Shia&#8209;led government in </p>
<p>Baghdad.</p>
<p>“I think in retrospect I was wrong and I think the surge did produce what General </p>
<p>Petraeus was seeking to achieve by it, not just to create the sort of breathing space </p>
<p>for some politics to work, but that it did, more sustainably than I assumed, quieten </p>
<p>those areas which were extremely violent.”</p>
<p>1063</p>
<p><b>Iraqi border police progress</b></p>
<p>The DoD reported on 2 March 2007 that MNSTC&#8209;I had trained 28,400 Department of </p>
<p>Border Enforcement (DBE) and Port of Entry (POE) personnel and that the DBE was </p>
<p>supported by 28 Coalition Border Transition Teams.</p>
<p>1064</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later in the year a joint DBE and MNSTC&#8209;I five&#8209;year plan was developed to bring the total </p>
<p>number of constructed border forts and annexes to 723</p>
<p>1065</p>
<p> and to increase the personnel </p>
<p>requirement to 46,000.</p>
<p>1066</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 6 September, the Independent Commission on the Security Forces in Iraq reported to </p>
<p>Congress its conclusion that:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s border security forces are generally ineffective and need more equipment, </p>
<p>training, and infrastructure before they can play a significant role in securing Iraq’s </p>
<p>borders. The Department of Border Enforcement suffers from poor support from </p>
<p>the Ministry of Interior. Overall border security is undermined by the division of </p>
<p>responsibilities between the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Transportation. </p>
<p>Corruption and external infiltration of the border security forces are widespread, and </p>
<p>the borders are porous.”</p>
<p>1067</p>
<p>On 18 December 2008, the JIC assessed that the DBE “suffer from departmental </p>
<p>underinvestment and corruption” and “are unable to protect Iraq’s borders”.</p>
<p>1068</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By August 2010, the DBE had 40,000 personnel and operated out of 657 forts and </p>
<p>annexes.</p>
<p>1069</p>
<p> It was estimated that over 60,000 personnel would be required to staff the </p>
<p>planned number of forts.</p>

<p><b>The justice sector</b></p>
<p><b>1129. </b> The minutes of DOP(I) on 30 March 2006 recorded that in discussion it was stated:</p>
<p>“Work was needed to identify what was required to build Iraqi judicial capacity … </p>
<p>Building up the Iraqi judicial system would take significant commitment and </p>
<p>resources. Was it currently assigned a high enough priority in HMG’s [Her Majesty’s </p>
<p>Government’s] long term plans?”</p>
<p>1070</p>
<p><b>1130. </b> On 23 May, a junior official in IPU emailed the British Embassy Baghdad to ask if </p>
<p>there were any “gaps” that could be addressed in the justice sector through the 2007/08 </p>
<p>GCPP bid.</p>
<p>1071</p>
<p> The official wrote that the FCO, the MOD and DFID agreed it could </p>
<p>become “the weak link in the Rule of Law chain” and undermine the SSR effort. </p>
<p><b>1131. </b> A junior official in Baghdad replied on 25 May, agreeing that “the justice </p>
<p>sector has been and continues to be ‘the missing link’”.</p>
<p>1072</p>
<p> He wrote that the US was </p>
<p>“looking to spending hundreds of millions of dollars in the justice sector”, covering </p>
<p>judicial personal security, courthouse security and administration, expanding Central </p>
<p>Criminal Court of Iraq capacity and forensic training for judges. The EU JustLex </p>
<p>programme (see Box, ‘EU integrated police and Rule of Law mission for Iraq’, earlier </p>
<p>in this Section) had been extended recently and the EU Commission had €40m for </p>
<p>“Governance” programmes. </p>
<p><b>1132. </b> Looking at what the UK could provide, the official wrote that a Rule of Law </p>
<p>Sectoral Working Group, chaired by the Chief Justice, had produced a “unified” strategy. </p>
<p>The Chief Justice had advised that the Iraqi system did not want:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more “short training courses in generic human rights issues in foreign locations” </p>
<p>– those took judges “away from their day jobs” for too long and further training </p>
<p>for existing judges should be considered;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“more Western advisers” – due to language and access barriers; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more “soft” assistance – the UK had “published at great expense a number of </p>
<p>pamphlets, CDs, training packages and other materials. Often these have not </p>
<p>been used effectively, if … at all”.</p>
<p><b>1133. </b> The official added:</p>
<p>“In essence, the Iraqis don’t want to be told what they should do, or what their rights </p>
<p>are: they want concrete assistance to help them do what they know they should do, </p>
<p>or help make those paper rights a reality.”</p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>1134. </b> The official’s view was that nothing “meaningful” had been done since the </p>
<p>2004 International Legal Assistance Consortium (ILAC) project (described in Box, </p>
<p>‘International Legal Assistance Consortium’, earlier in this Section). The official </p>
<p>recommended funding an expansion of the Judicial Training Institute to improve the </p>
<p>capacity and quality of training for new judges. Current facilities were too small to </p>
<p>accommodate enough students, textbooks were “insufficient”, there were no computers </p>
<p>and most lecturers did not receive payment.</p>
<p><b>1135. </b> A junior official in DFID reported to Mr Benn on 30 June that the success of the </p>
<p>Rule of Law Sectoral Working Group had been “limited”:</p>
<p>“The Working Group struggles to function effectively under a weak chair (the Chief </p>
<p>Justice). He lacks the resources to manage the administrative workload and has </p>
<p>requested support from donors.”</p>
<p>1073</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1136. </b> To help overcome that, the official wrote that DFID was providing £93,000 for an </p>
<p>experienced Iraqi lawyer to support the Chief Justice, as recommended by the FCO in </p>
<p>Baghdad, believing that that “modest investment” could “have a significant impact across </p>
<p>the sector”.</p>
<p><b>1137. </b> On 8 January 2007, Mr Banner wrote to Mr Irfan Siddiq, Private Secretary to </p>
<p>Mr David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, to commission advice on the current state of </p>
<p>the Iraqi justice system, including the degree of governmental interference and how that </p>
<p>might realistically be addressed.</p>
<p>1074</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1138. </b> Mr Siddiq replied with a paper produced by the IPU and the British Embassy </p>
<p>Baghdad on 16 February.</p>
<p>1075</p>
<p><b>1139. </b> The paper reported that there were 850 judges in Iraq; 150 of those were in </p>
<p>Baghdad. There was “widespread recognition” that that number needed to increase </p>
<p>by between 500 and 600 to “alleviate the backlog of cases”. There were 178 judges </p>
<p>expected to graduate from the Judicial Training Institute in June 2007 and another </p>
<p>58 in June 2008. </p>
<p><b>1140. </b> Governmental interference with the judiciary remained a concern. Citing </p>

<p>322</p>
<p><b>1141. </b> Militia influence and intimidation remained “a grave threat”; 23 judges had been </p>
<p>killed in the past three years and “many more” had been kidnapped or threatened. </p>
<p>Security measures were being provided to the judiciary and other measures were being </p>
<p>installed at courthouses. FPS had proved “ineffective”, having been infiltrated by militias.</p>
<p><b>1142. </b> The FCO paper sent by Mr Siddiq was provided to members of DOP(I) for their </p>
<p>meeting on 8 March.</p>
<p>1076</p>
<p> It stated that there were issues related to judicial capacity, </p>
<p>security, a backlog of cases (with between 7,500 and 12,500 detainees being held </p>
<p>pre&#8209;trial by the Iraqi authorities) and governmental interference. It made a series </p>
<p>of recommendations, including those mentioned in the Better Basra Mark III plan </p>
<p>(described later in this Section). Other recommendations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>making it clear that governmental interference was not acceptable (when there </p>
<p>is evidence of it having occurred);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a visit to Baghdad by Lord Goldsmith to emphasise the importance of the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>EU and UN action to support the principles of the Rule of Law and judicial </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of security to judicial officials and witnesses. </p>
<p><b>1143. </b> In discussion at DOP(I) it was suggested that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>find ways to address as a matter of urgency the large numbers of detainees;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>take advantage of being able to act under the UNSCR mandate while it was still </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1147. </b> Baroness Scotland, Lord Goldsmith’s successor, visited Iraq from 19 to </p>

<p>1082</p>
<p> The purpose of her visit was to “emphasise the importance of the </p>
<p>Rule of Law and the independence of the judiciary”. She summarised that there was “a </p>
<p>long way to go to establish the Rule of Law in Iraq” and although her message was well </p>
<p>received there was a need to “ensure that those words are met with action”. She stated:</p>
<p>“I was very much struck that there was a genuine lack of leadership and </p>
<p>understanding of where the responsibility for driving forward the Rule of Law agenda </p>
<p>lies within the Government of Iraq. It seemed to be the responsibility of everyone </p>

<p> The </p>
<p>official wrote that the Ministerial Committee had “been taking steps to improve Iraqi </p>
<p>procedures for detainee handling, but progress [was] slow”.</p>
<p><b>1150. </b> The official stated that detainees were “frequently subject to abuse”, mainly in </p>
<p>MOI facilities, “often to obtain confessions”. The Ministry of Justice’s prisons suffered </p>
<p>from “severe overcrowding”. The official wrote:</p>
<p>“Through a combination of negligence, incompetence, poor co&#8209;ordination and </p>

<p><b>Mid&#8209;2007 assessments of the Iraqi Security Forces</b></p>
<p><b>1153. </b> On 27 June 2007, the JIC provided an update on the ISF.</p>
<p>1087</p>
<p> It recorded little </p>
<p>change from the January paper described earlier in this Section. Development of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Army was still described as “slow” and the IPS remained “ineffective”. The security </p>
<p>Ministries were also judged to be “underperforming”. The assessment recorded:</p>
<p>“Work is under way by Prime Minister Maliki’s government to develop a national </p>
<p>security strategy, but it is unlikely to make a difference to Iraq’s security as long </p>
<p>as the government remains factionalised and fails to make progress on national </p>
<p>reconciliation […]” </p>
<p><b>1154. </b> On 4 July, a DIS paper looked at future Iraqi security structures.</p>
<p>1088</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The plethora of security groupings with unique command and control </p>
<p>mechanisms will continue to expand, and could destabilise the complex national </p>
<p>security environment. This expansion provides an opportunity for furthering </p>
<p>sectarian agendas and potential higher levels of intra&#8209;ISF conflict.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Duplication of responsibilities and expanding remits of strategic authorities </p>
<p>will continue as incumbent Prime Ministers seek practical solutions to national </p>
<p>security threats. Sectarian bias will shape these bodies and they will circumvent </p>
<p>the chain of command.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The amalgamation of Shia militias into national security structures ensures that </p>
<p>future Iraqi security strategy will be overwhelmingly Shia&#8209;based. This will lead to </p>
<p>continued Sunni marginalisation, a justification for Sunni nationalist insurgents </p>
<p>and a spur for AQ&#8209;I intent.”</p>

<p>325</p>
<p><b>1155. </b> The JIC Assessment of 6 September included an update on ISF performance.</p>
<p>1089</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It reported that:</p>
<p>“We judge Iraqi confidence, both among Ministers and more generally, has been </p>
<p>damaged by the popular perception that security has not significantly improved.</p>
<p>“… The government has taken some steps to address human rights abuses: sacking </p>
<p>23 senior National Police Commanders and disbanding an entire battalion accused </p>
<p>of complicity in sectarian acts. But other individuals accused of sectarian abuses </p>
<p>remain in positions of responsibility.”</p>
<p><b>Counting the police</b></p>
<p>With the passage of time it was becoming increasingly difficult to know how many police </p>
<p>officers trained by CPATT were still employed by the MOI, or what percentage of police on </p>
<p>the MOI payroll were trained and equipped by CPATT.</p>
<p>1090</p>
<p> That was caused by a number </p>
<p>of factors:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the lack of an effective personnel management system in the MOI; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a high attrition rate (about 20 percent per year, with the MOI reporting paying </p>
<p>death benefits for more than 6,000 police officers since May 2003); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>burgeoning local recruitment.</p>
<p>Provincial Governors had authority to hire more IPS officers than MNSTC&#8209;I had agreed </p>
<p>to train and equip. In those areas, the MOI and the Provincial Governors were responsible </p>
<p>for the extra training and equipment requirements. As police were generally unwilling to </p>
<p>move areas, it was not possible for extra officers to be moved to areas where there was </p>
<p>a deficit.</p>
<p>1091</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of the additional police had received little or no training.</p>

<p>held the post of US National Security Advisor from 2009 to 2010. Included in the team </p>
<p>of 20 was ACC Duncan McCausland, a serving PSNI officer.</p>
<p>1093</p>
<p> The Commission was </p>
<p>tasked with assessing the capability of the ISF; their ability to maintain Iraq’s territorial </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>1157. </b> On 6 September, the Commission reported that the ISF’s progress was “uneven” </p>
<p>but “that there should be increasing improvement in both their readiness and their </p>
<p>capability for the internal security of Iraq”. The ISF “would not be able to secure Iraqi </p>
<p>borders against conventional military threats in the near term”. Whilst assessed as </p>
<p>“severely deficient” in combat support, there was “clear evidence of developing the </p>
<p>baseline infrastructure that leads to the successful formation of a national defense </p>
<p>capability”. </p>
<p><b>1158. </b> The Commission judged that the Iraqi Army was capable of taking over an </p>
<p>increasing amount of combat responsibilities from coalition forces, but the ISF would </p>
<p>be “unable to fulfil their essential security responsibilities independently over the next </p>
<p>12&#8209;18 months”. </p>
<p><b>1159. </b> The Commission’s conclusions on the MOI and its forces were less positive:</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Interior is a ministry in name only. It is widely regarded as </p>
<p>being dysfunctional and sectarian, and suffers from ineffective leadership. Such </p>
<p>fundamental flaws present a serious obstacle to achieving the levels of readiness, </p>
<p>capability, and effectiveness in police and border security forces that are essential </p>
<p>for internal security and stability in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>1160. </b> The Report went on describe the IPS as “fragile”, “underequipped” and </p>
<p>“compromised by militia and insurgent infiltration”, although it assessed that the IPS </p>
<p>could improve rapidly should the MOI become more functional. Of the National Police, </p>
<p>the Report stated that it was “not viable in its current form”. </p>
<p><b>1161. </b> On 10 and 11 September, Gen Petraeus testified to Congress, warning of the </p>
<p>dangers of handing over to ISF too early.</p>
<p>1094</p>
<p> He did note that “despite their shortages, </p>
<p>many Iraqi [Army] units across Iraq now operate with minimal coalition assistance”.</p>
<p>1095</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1162. </b> A Report to Congress on 14 September stated that, by July 2007, Iraqi Army </p>
<p>divisions had been at about 103 percent of authorised strength, but that masked the </p>
<p>extremely low proportion that were present for duty.</p>
<p>1096</p>
<p> Officer ranks were a particular </p>
<p>concern, with manning levels of only 69 percent. </p>
<p><b>1163. </b> A Report to Congress on 14 December 2007 stated that authorised ISF personnel </p>
<p>numbers were increasing as a result of three factors:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>successful offensive operations and local awakenings providing a new pool of </p>
<p>recruits in a wider range of communities;</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>Improvements in Iraqi Security Force capability during 2007 and 2008</b></p>
<p><b>1167. </b> From late 2007 onwards the security situation across Iraq improved, as detailed in </p>
<p>Section 9.6. Alongside that reduction in threat, ISF capability began to grow, as judged </p>
<p>by the JIC in its 20 December Assessment.</p>
<p>1099</p>
<p> Although it reiterated previous concerns </p>
<p>about the MOI and the ISF, it judged:</p>
<p>“… the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are in a much better position than six months </p>
<p>ago, partly because of an overall improvement in capability and partly because of </p>
<p>a reduction in threat. The prospects for them being able to successfully manage </p>
<p>security outside Baghdad, without MNF ground support, by the end of 2008 will </p>
<p>continue to be patchy across Iraq and depend heavily on progress being made on </p>
<p>national reconciliation and the maintenance of MNF&#8209;led security gains. Neither is </p>
<p>guaranteed.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1168. </b> On 5 June 2008, the JIC judged that the ISF were “much better placed to manage </p>
<p>security through 2008”.</p>
<p>1100</p>
<p> On Prime Minister Maliki’s influence on the ISF, the JIC wrote:</p>
<p>“In the last year he has been increasingly dictating where, when and how Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces (ISF) are deployed. Security policy decisions more widely are </p>
<p>increasingly being taken without reference to the coalition … </p>
<p>“We assess that Maliki maintains a firm grip on decision making within Iraq’s security </p>
<p>Ministries. He has further increased his personal control of ISF … </p>
<p>“We judge that in most cases this greater autocracy has increased overall ISF </p>
<p>cohesiveness and responsiveness.”</p>
<p><b>1169. </b> On 10 September, the JIC assessed the future of JAM:</p>
<p>“… military pressure and Sadr’s order for his followers to avoid further conflict with </p>
<p>Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) in March forced JAM to surrender its control of the streets </p>
<p>in large parts of Basra, Baghdad and Al Amara. ISF now dominate the vast majority </p>
<p>of these areas, in many cases for the first time in years.”</p>
<p>1101</p>
<p><b>1170. </b> On 18 December, the JIC described the Iraqi Army as “an increasingly effective </p>
<p>force at all levels”, with the National Police approaching a similar capability.</p>
<p>1102</p>
<p> However, </p>
<p>despite general improvements, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“… local police remain ineffective, due to a lack of resources, militia infiltration and </p>
<p>corruption. Law enforcement is also undermined by an overstretched and under </p>
<p>performing judiciary. These weaknesses will inhibit the normalisation of Iraqi society </p>
<p>and real stability for years to come.”</p>

<p>329</p>
<p><b>1171. </b> On the balance of power between the police and the army, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“The army cannot provide local security or enforce the law while it remains focused </p>
<p>on COINOPS [counter&#8209;insurgency operations], and its method of operation – </p>
<p>checkpoints, barriers, destruction of property – are unsuited to the task. Until the IPS </p>
<p>and the justice system are improved and purged of militia influence and corruption, </p>
<p>Iraq will need to choose between army methods and a police force that is incapable.”</p>

<p><b>1172. </b> From 2006, a number of local militias and neighbourhood watches began </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating with the MNF in Baghdad and Anbar province, acting as additional security </p>
<p>forces in the fight against AQ&#8209;I. They were known originally as “Concerned Local </p>
<p>Citizens” and subsequently as the “Sons of Iraq” (described in more detail in Section </p>
<p>9.6). In a report to Congress, the DoD stated:</p>
<p>“The Sons of Iraq are a key component of the counterinsurgency fight due to </p>
<p>their knowledge of the local populace and their ability to report activity that might </p>
<p>otherwise escape the attention of coalition and Iraqi forces.”</p>
<p>1103</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1173. </b> On 25 April 2007, an eGram from Mr Asquith reported that AQ was “determined </p>
<p>to prove that they can still operate (against Shia and Sunni targets) and to exacerbate </p>
<p>sectarian violence” in Baghdad.</p>
<p>1104</p>
<p> They were yet to feel the “full effect” of the Baghdad </p>
<p>Security Plan;</p>
<p>1105</p>
<p> that was expected by the end of June. </p>
<p><b>1174. </b> Outside Baghdad, Mr Asquith said, the success of turning the Sunni resistance </p>
<p>and tribal groups against AQ had been “more rapid than expected”. He reported that the </p>
<p>groups were confronting AQ with increasing aggression, and “whereas previously the </p>
<p>whole eastern aspect of [Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province] was AQ controlled, this </p>
<p>is now reduced to a few blocks”. </p>
<p><b>1175. </b> Mr Asquith wrote that Emergency Response Units had been established to help </p>
<p>maintain security, with three units in Ramadi so far and a further 14 planned later in the </p>
<p>year. There was also local appetite for the creation of similar resistance groups in other </p>
<p>regions; the Baghdad district of Abu Ghraib had seen around 1,200 individuals reporting </p>
<p>for recruitment in a single weekend.</p>
<p><b>1176. </b> On 22 April, it was agreed at the MCNS that Prime Minister Maliki would chair a </p>
<p>group (to include MNF&#8209;I) to determine what the Iraqi Government would be prepared to </p>
<p>offer to opposition and resistance groups in exchange for renouncing violence.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>330</p>
<p><b>1177. </b> Acting Assistant Chief Constable Michael Colbourne became the Chief Police </p>
<p>Adviser in autumn 2006. In his bi&#8209;weekly report on 31 May 2007, he wrote that Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki had passed an order permitting the creation of Police Support Units, </p>
<p>attempting to win the allegiance of “middle of the road militias”.</p>
<p>1107</p>
<p> Members of a Police </p>
<p>Support Unit were paid 75 percent of a policeman’s wage and were provided with </p>
<p>uniforms. They were not armed as Mr Maliki reportedly believed that they had “enough </p>
<p>weapons of their own”. The new units did not receive the full basic recruit training and </p>
<p>were expected to be in place for a maximum of 18 months. </p>
<p><b>1178. </b> In his bi&#8209;weekly report on 18 June, ACC Colbourne wrote that Police Support </p>
<p>Units had been created “in the usual rushed and hurried way”.</p>
<p>1108</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“The Iraqis are not on board with this and our MOI counterparts are opposed to it. </p>
<p>“The reputation of the police as a whole may be badly damaged by the arming of </p>
<p>the militia and calling them policemen. The MOI are not equipped to undertake yet </p>
<p>another ‘good idea’ that the coalition is trying to push through.”</p>
<p><b>1179. </b> ACC Colbourne suggested that the Police Support Units could be moved under </p>
<p>the IMOD’s control and trained as a “National Guard”: “There are many positives to </p>
<p>separating this from the MOI and putting it under the [Iraqi] MOD.”</p>
<p><b>1180. </b> On 14 June, Mr Banner reported to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“The US are … focused on the Anbar model, but this is creating real tension with </p>
<p>Maliki. Violence continues to be down in Anbar, but the motivations of the tribes </p>
<p>remain unclear, and they continue to express their opposition to the Government </p>
<p>of Iraq. Nor do they tie in to any convincing, wider, Sunni leadership … Maliki </p>
<p>is … coming under pressure from other Shia over the creation of a well&#8209;armed </p>
<p>Sunni militia, particularly as the US now propose to extend the model to areas of </p>
<p>Baghdad …</p>
<p>“The Pentagon this week also released its now regular quarterly report on progress </p>
<p>in Iraq. This noted that overall levels of violence in the country had not decreased </p>
<p>since the start of the surge, noted that the GoI’s delivery had been ‘uneven’, and that </p>
<p>it had made ‘little progress’ on the political front – reconciliation was described as a </p>
<p>‘serious unfulfilled objective’.”</p>
<p>1109</p>
<p><b>1181. </b> In an interview with <i>Newsweek</i> on 15 June, Prime Minister Maliki said:</p>
<p>“Now, some field commanders make mistakes since they do not know the facts </p>
<p>about people they deal with. They make mistakes by arming tribes sometimes, </p>
<p>and this is dangerous because this will create new militias … I believe that the </p>

<p>government.”</p>
<p>1110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1182. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Asquith recalled:</p>
<p>“From the second half of 2006 and certainly through 2007, the American attitude </p>
<p>moved … to engage some Sunni Arab tribes in the Sunni Arab provinces to throw off </p>
<p>the militias and Al Qaida groups that were positioned there, and to engage in local </p>
<p>cease&#8209;fires, with the aim, in time, of those local cease&#8209;fires spreading more broadly </p>
<p>across the country.”</p>
<p>1111</p>
<p><b>1183. </b> In an email to the FCO on 14 June 2007, Mr Asquith wrote that Mr Blair and ACM </p>
<p>Stirrup had requested further advice from Baghdad on coalition support for the Anbar </p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>1112</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“… I do not doubt the tactical benefit of engaging those in Anbar and other Sunni </p>
<p>areas in which AQ operate with the purpose of persuading them to turn against </p>
<p>AQ. Nor do I have any reason to doubt MNF&#8209;I assessments that this engagement </p>
<p>has delivered significant results in terms of identifying AQ operatives and caches, </p>
<p>restricting AQ operating capabilities and reducing attacks … against coalition forces. </p>
<p>Engaging with local armed, militant, insurgency or opposition groups was of course </p>
<p>what I and others were engaged in throughout 2005. I am not opposed to the </p>
<p>principle.”</p>
<p><b>1184. </b> Nevertheless, Mr Asquith questioned whether those groups had turned against </p>
<p>AQ for wholly ideological reasons. He thought the groups were more strongly motivated </p>
<p>by a power struggle with AQ, which was encroaching on the tribes’ territory, by money </p>
<p>or by a desire – under the protection of US forces – to rearm and prepare for a future </p>
<p>campaign against Iran and/or the “Shia government”. </p>
<p><b>1185. </b> Mr Asquith considered that that had had an adverse effect on the Coalition’s </p>
<p>broader reconciliation strategy. It increased Prime Minister Maliki’s concerns and put </p>
<p>him “under severe pressure from his Shia constituency who pose the question: why is </p>
<p>he tolerating the creation of what effectively are Sunni militias who pose a threat (now </p>
<p>or later) to Shia communities, while at the same time tolerating regular coalition attacks </p>
<p>on Shia militias?” </p>
<p><b>1186. </b> Mr Asquith acknowledged:</p>
<p>“Given the imperative for [Gen] Petraeus to deliver something by 13 September … </p>
<p>we can’t halt the engagement process. We should instead seek to shape it in a way </p>
<p>that reduces the risk.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>1187. </b> Mr Asquith suggested a number of approaches to reduce the risk of Anbar tribes </p>
<p>derailing reconciliation efforts. They included support for an Executive Council (through </p>
<p>which the integration of militia groups should be managed), establishing political tests </p>
<p>for the militia to demonstrate support for the Iraqi Government, and enforcing clear time </p>
<p>limits for their existence before being disbanded or incorporated into the IPS. </p>
<p><b>1188. </b> On 16 June, Mr Asquith reported that he had discussed those proposals with </p>
<p>Dr Mowaffak al&#8209;Rubaie, Iraqi National Security Adviser, at a meeting that day and that </p>
<p>Dr al&#8209;Rubaie had agreed with the approach.</p>
<p>1113</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1189. </b> On 21 June, Mr Asquith reported that the concept of an Executive Committee was </p>
<p>“beginning to take on substance with Maliki in receipt of a Presidency paper setting out </p>
<p>how they propose it should work to which he will respond”.</p>
<p>1114</p>
<p><b>1190. </b> In his weekly report on 24 June, Lieutenant General Graeme Lamb, SBMR&#8209;I from </p>
<p>September 2006 to July 2007, wrote: </p>
<p>“An increasing number of tribes, neighbourhoods, Sunni insurgents and just local </p>
<p>people are choosing to reject, occasionally terminally, AQ&#8209;I. This is seen particularly </p>
<p>in the Southern Baghdad belts where, for example in one area there has been an </p>
<p>80 percent reduction in IEDs … This ‘people power’ is extending to Salah ad Din, </p>
<p>Diyala, Ninawa and of course is already in full effect in Al Anbar. In smaller, but </p>
<p>notable cases, we are seeing the same effect in Baghdad itself, so the broader </p>
<p>‘awakening’ continues to make ground.”</p>
<p>1115</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1191. </b> On 4 July, a DIS report stated:</p>
<p>“Central government will remain extremely sceptical of Sunni tribal initiatives in </p>
<p>provinces with mixed sectarian demographics. The Shia&#8209;dominated government </p>
<p>fears these could lead to the return of Sunni rule, and will ensure there are </p>
<p>mechanisms to minimise this risk.”</p>
<p>1116</p>
<p><b>1192. </b> In his weekly report on 6 August, Lieutenant General William Rollo, SBMR&#8209;I from </p>
<p>July 2007 to March 2009, wrote that the Government of Iraq had accepted 1,700 former </p>
<p>Sunni fighters in Abu Ghraib into the IPS.</p>
<p>1117</p>
<p> That was the first time that the government </p>
<p>had taken steps to incorporate the Sunni militia from areas outside the Sunni tribal </p>
<p>regions into the MOI. Lt Gen Rollo described that as a “significant concession by the </p>
<p>GOI [Government of Iraq] … [and] potentially a major win that will reassure other Sunnis </p>
<p>who have come into the fold that the GOI genuinely intends to ‘see them right’”.</p>

<p><b>1193. </b> On 20 December, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“77,000 Concerned Local Citizens (CLCs) and other tribal ‘awakenings’, drawn from </p>
<p>the Sunni insurgency and, to a much lesser extent, from Shia militias, are now acting </p>
<p>as force multipliers for MNF and ISF in Baghdad and along the Euphrates and Tigris </p>
<p>valleys north of Baghdad. The MOI continue to resist assuming formal responsibility </p>
<p>for these volunteers (including paying them). If their payments stopped we judge that </p>
<p>many would resume attacks on the MNF and ISF. Their loyalty to central government </p>
<p>is likely to remain patchy in the absence of broader national reconciliation; we judge </p>
<p>they are likely to become an increasingly attractive target for infiltration by both </p>
<p>Sunni and Shia extremists.”</p>
<p>1118</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1194. </b> On 8 January 2008, Air Marshal Stuart Peach, Chief of Defence Intelligence, </p>
<p>briefed the Chiefs of Staff that there were plans to integrate 20 percent of the Concerned </p>
<p>Local Citizens into the ISF, with the remainder being available for hire by other ministries </p>
<p>for public works programmes.</p>
<p>1119</p>
<p> US funding was due to expire in January 2008 and </p>
<p>future funding arrangements were unclear. He noted that failure to address the issue </p>
<p>could lead to resentment and a return to violence among former Sunni fighters but that </p>
<p>provision for Concerned Local Citizen salaries would probably be opposed by a number </p>
<p>of Shia groups.</p>
<p><b>1195. </b> On 5 June, the JIC assessed that, of the approximately 106,000 (mainly </p>
<p>Sunni) Sons of Iraq, around 16,300 had been recruited into the ISF, mainly in Anbar </p>
<p>province.</p>
<p>1120</p>
<p> Elsewhere, relations between ISF and the Sons of Iraq were described as </p>
<p>“tense”. The creation of a Sons of Iraq programme in Basra in 2008 is described later in </p>
<p>this Section. Considering the future, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“MNF reporting suggests that at least a quarter of SoI [Sons of Iraq] members </p>
<p>expect jobs in the ISF: for others, some form of continued stipend or civil service </p>
<p>job would probably suffice. The GoI is unlikely to be willing or able to meet either </p>
<p>expectation; or assume responsibility for commanding and paying the SoI this year. </p>
<p>So long as it does not, we judge that SoI rejection of AQ&#8209;I, tolerance of MNF and </p>
<p>willingness to refrain from anti&#8209;government violence will be fragile. […]” </p>
<p><b>1196. </b> An eGram from Baghdad on 7 October reported that the Iraqi Government had </p>
<p>taken responsibility for paying the Sons of Iraq located in Baghdad, (50 percent of the </p>
<p>103,000 total) from 1 October.</p>
<p>1121</p>
<p> Responsibility for the other half would follow later that </p>
<p>month. The Iraqi Government and the Sons of Iraq did, however, remain suspicious of </p>
<p>one another: the Iraqi Government believing that the number of the Sons of Iraq had </p>
<p>been “inflated by the various leaders in order to line their own pockets”, and the Sons </p>

<p>of Iraq seeing the Iraqi Government “as a sectarian government determined to persecute </p>
<p>them when the protective US hand [was] removed”. </p>
<p><b>1197. </b> After “detailed examination of the lists”, the IMOD had accepted that “most of the </p>
<p>SOI” existed and was putting procedures in place to enable payment to foot soldiers </p>
<p>directly (reducing group leaders’ income). Standardising pay was still a problem and </p>
<p>recruitment of the Sons of Iraq into the ISF was slow; only 12,000 members had been </p>
<p>recruited so far. </p>
<p><b>1198. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported that AQ had sought to “exploit the </p>
<p>situation by increasing pressure in Baghdad and Anbar through violent activity”. There </p>
<p>was “some evidence” that AQ was trying to lure back some Sons of Iraq by attempting </p>
<p>to outbid the Iraqi Government. The US and the Iraqi Government recognised their </p>
<p>continued financial support would be necessary to keep the Sons of Iraq “on side”. </p>
<p><b>1199. </b> The JIC assessed that standardising and distributing pay was still an issue in their </p>
<p>report on 18 December.</p>

<p><b>The UK’s future bilateral relationship with Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>1201. </b> On 27 May 2008, Lieutenant General John Cooper, the then SBMR&#8209;I, raised the </p>
<p>matter of the UK’s longer&#8209;term relationship with Iraq with AM Stirrup.</p>
<p>1123</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“I am aware of current staffing on how a future training mission might be funded </p>
<p>and manned (including the involvement of NATO) and the relative importance of </p>
<p>this against other operational priorities. I would simply observe that we have a real </p>
<p>opportunity here – both in terms of the UK long&#8209;term relationship with Iraq and how </p>
<p>we ‘sell’ our post&#8209;TELIC posture to the US.”</p>
<p><b>1202. </b> Commenting on that paragraph in Lt Gen Cooper’s report, Mr Edward Ferguson, </p>
<p>Mr Browne’s Private Secretary, wrote:</p>
<p>“This is a bit of a concern. Although your intent on this is clear it seems that this </p>
<p>hasn’t yet got out of the starting blocks … I gather that the main issues are a view </p>
<p>that the Army can’t afford the manpower (because of other priorities) and that </p>

<p><b>1203. </b> The details of negotiating the UK’s continued presence in Iraq following the expiry </p>
<p>of resolution 1790 on 31 December 2008 is dealt with in Section 9.7. Ahead of a visit </p>
<p>to Iraq in late October, Mr John Hutton, the Defence Secretary from October 2008, was </p>
<p>advised by the British Embassy Baghdad:</p>
<p>“The UK’s wish to develop a broader based bilateral relationship, but with a </p>
<p>continued defence element focused on training, fits with [Prime Minister] Maliki’s </p>
<p>own professed aims. But he remains deeply suspicious of us and feels politically </p>
<p>besieged … The US/coalition are still needed to support, train and mentor Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces as they take on more responsibility. Failure to deliver a legal base </p>
<p>for this to continue beyond the end of 2008 would be destabilising.”</p>
<p>1125</p>
<p><b>1204. </b> A key issue with respect to SSR was the provision of a combat role for UK forces; </p>
<p>the MOD judged that to be essential to mentor 14th Division but Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>was reported to be reluctant to authorise it.</p>
<p>1126</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1205. </b> In his end of tour report, Lt Gen Cooper wrote about the UK’s future strategic </p>
<p>defence relationship with Iraq:</p>
<p>“As I depart I confess to a sense of frustration that we have yet to confirm the nature, </p>
<p>scale and resource of our long&#8209;term military relationship with Iraq, particularly with </p>
<p>the Iraqi Armed Forces. The Gledhill Report</p>
<p>1127</p>
<p> on officer training reported a year </p>
<p>ago, as I arrived, yet we have yet to confirm what we are offering. The Iraqi MOD is </p>
<p>very keen, desperate almost, to establish links with its former mentoring nation. Thus </p>
<p>far, we have promised something but not yet delivered it. I acknowledge the financial </p>
<p>pressure which the UK Defence budget faces, but we have an opportunity to cement </p>

<p>1149</p>
<p> The paper drew on recent assessments </p>
<p>from the MOD and the JIC of the ISF:</p>
<p>“The picture across Iraq is of growing, but variable, levels of capability … According </p>
<p>to the US&#8209;led ISF development plan, all divisions of the Iraqi Army and MOI forces </p>
<p>should be trained and equipped by the end of 2006 … The development of the </p>
<p>police is significantly behind that of the Iraqi Army, with particular problems over </p>
<p>militia&#8209;links, over&#8209;recruitment, corruption and criminality.</p>
<p>“In the South, the 10th Division is judged to be increasingly effective … However, </p>
<p>these forces are untested in undertaking counter&#8209;insurgency operations without MNF </p>
<p>support. The police are a more significant cause for concern, with militia links and a </p>
<p>lack of effective political control either locally or from the centre … </p>
<p>“The overall MNF plan, which the MOD judge to be robust is predicated on the </p>
<p>MNF retaining substantial forces in Iraq until 2007 to support the ISF … but even </p>
<p>that timeline will be tested if the scale and sophistication of the insurgency does not </p>
<p>diminish. The MOD supports this assessment highlighting a number of risks with the </p>
<p>plan that fall outside its focus on training, mentoring and equipping:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the degree to which Iraqi leadership on security develops;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the precise nature of the security and political environment the ISF will face </p>
<p>at the point of transition … In the South there is a particular concern over the </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>A basic level of corruption was endemic to Iraqi society but the current level </p>
<p>wasn’t “‘hand in the till’ activity”; the SCU was “synonymous with killings, torture </p>
<p>and abuse”. </p>
<p><b>1235. </b> ACC Barton advocated further UK pressure to encourage the MOI to purge </p>
<p>employees, mentioning a recent purge of MOI employees (including IPS) in which there </p>
<p>were “86 convicted murderers, 345 with bribery convictions, rapists, kidnappers, and </p>
<p>even two IPS who were supposed to have been executed in the 90s but were alive and </p>
<p>working in Baghdad!” </p>
<p><b>1236. </b> ACC Barton described the Tactical Support Unit (TSU) and the confidential TIPS </p>
<p>hotline as successes but added that there was a “woeful lack of command and control </p>
<p>skills by senior Iraqi Police Officers” and “little public confidence in the IPS as an entity”. </p>
<p><b>Problems with the 10th Division – mutiny and looting</b></p>
<p><b>1237. </b> Over the summer of 2006, problems began to surface with the largely untested </p>
<p>10th Division.</p>
<p><b>1238. </b> On 10 August, Maj Gen Shirreff reported the murder of a colonel in 10th Division </p>
<p>and suggested that the murder might have been motivated by his “resolute stand against </p>
<p>militia influence in the IA”.</p>
<p>1155</p>
<p> Maj Gen Shirreff described 10th Division as “not perfect </p>
<p>but it is the best hope we have for now of an Iraqi solution to the security problems. </p>
<p>Emerging signs of increasing politicisation and infiltration within the IA can only be </p>
<p>bad news.”</p>
<p><b>1239. </b> The JIC considered the security situation in the South on 27 September:</p>
<p>“We judge that the Iraq Army in the South can cope with the limited threat posed by </p>
<p>Iraqi Sunni Arab nationalists and jihadists. But their willingness and ability to tackle </p>
<p>Shia militias is doubtful. MNF describe the Iraqi Army’s 10th Division in MND(SE) </p>
<p>as “fragile”. Its 10,000 personnel can perform basic tasks (patrols and static </p>
<p>guard duties) independently, and it has provided limited support to MNF counter </p>

<p><b>Operations SALAMANCA and SINBAD</b></p>
<p><b>1241. </b> Operation SALAMANCA was a plan conceived in the summer of 2006 to address </p>
<p>the security situation in the South and move Basra towards PIC. It is described in detail </p>
<p>in Section 9.5. </p>
<p><b>1242. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Richard Shirreff explained to the Inquiry that the Basra </p>
<p>Security Plan announced by Prime Minister Maliki had “amounted really to nothing </p>
<p>more than the establishment of a Basra security committee” and Op SALAMANCA was </p>
<p>therefore “the operationalising of the Iraqi Basra security plan”.</p>
<p>1158</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that its concept was:</p>
<p>“… to achieve security, to excise the death squads, to defeat JAM, through the </p>
<p>synchronised application of what we call kinetic, ie force, and non&#8209;kinetic, ie </p>
<p>reconstruction and development.”</p>
<p><b>1243. </b> In his weekly report on 31 August, Maj Gen Shirreff said that he aimed to prepare </p>
<p>10th Division for operations in Basra during Op SALAMANCA.</p>
<p>1159</p>
<p> He remarked that that </p>
<p>could provide “potentially more of an Iraqi face on Op SALAMANCA”.</p>
<p><b>1244. </b> On 1 September, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private </p>

<p><b>1245. </b> Mr Browne told the House of Commons on 11 September that 360 additional </p>
<p>personnel would be deployed to reinforce the effort in Basra.</p>
<p>1161</p>
<p> That comprised an </p>
<p>extended deployment of the Theatre Reserve Battalion and an uplift in Royal Engineers, </p>
<p>Royal Marines (one boat troop) and Royal Military Police (one troop) to augment training </p>
<p>of the IPS.</p>
<p><b>1246. </b> At the DOP(I) meeting on 14 September, the objectives of Op SALAMANCA were </p>
<p>described to Ministers as being to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase Iraqi political grip on the issue, by having a visible Iraqi face on the plan </p>
<p>and active involvement in the operation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase the confidence and competence of the ISF.</p>
<p>1162</p>
<p><b>1247. </b> On 15 September, Maj Gen Shirreff reported that the police were “still incapable </p>
<p>of providing even the most basic level of security; rather they are a major cause of </p>
<p>insecurity”.</p>
<p>1163</p>
<p> He anticipated that during Op SALAMANCA there would be “a concerted </p>
<p>and sustained effort by Police Training Teams” to “turn those police stations capable </p>
<p>of improvement into police stations that are capable of providing basic security in their </p>
<p>local areas”. His aim was “to cull the unredeemable and rehabilitate the ‘just about’ </p>
<p>salvageable”. </p>
<p><b>1248. </b> In a meeting with Gen Casey, Prime Minister Maliki was reported as saying that </p>
<p>“the security situation in Basra was not bad enough to warrant an operation that would </p>
<p>upset the political balance”.</p>
<p>1164</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1249. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Shirreff described gaining approval from the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government as an “absolutely non&#8209;stop grind”:</p>
<p>“Maliki said he didn’t want this operation to proceed, despite … declaring a state of </p>
<p>emergency. So I then went up to Baghdad … got to see Maliki and eventually briefed </p>
<p>him and persuaded him that this operation should continue.”</p>
<p>1165</p>
<p><b>1250. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that even travelling to meet Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>was difficult, with Gen Hamadi refusing to fly for two hours because he had received a </p>
<p>call from a Sadrist Minister who said, “This operation isn’t to continue”.</p>
<p><b>1251. </b> In response to the difficulties in securing approval, Op SALAMANCA was refined </p>
<p>and repackaged as “a reconstruction and development operation enabled by MNF and </p>
<p>MNF&#8209;led security”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>1252. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Major General Jonathan Shaw, GOC MND(SE) </p>
<p>from January to August 2007, said that Op SALAMANCA was altered “because of </p>
<p>resistance within the Shia polity”.</p>
<p>1166</p>
<p> In practice, that meant:</p>
<p>“… a lot of the kinetic element that had been intended in SALAMANCA was taken </p>
<p>out. It continued under another guise, if you like, and that just showed an early sign </p>
<p>that … you had to work within the tolerances of the Shia polity, and that became </p>
<p>particularly apparent where anyone in MNF tackled a Shia problem.”</p>
<p><b>1253. </b> Following a meeting of the Security Committee in mid&#8209;September, the name of </p>
<p>the operation was changed to Operation SINBAD.</p>
<p>1167</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1254. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Shirreff described how Op SINBAD was </p>
<p>undertaken.</p>
<p>1168</p>
<p> “Relatively soft areas” were selected, a surge of force was used to </p>
<p>secure the area, and teams were then put into police stations. Those teams went </p>
<p>“through the police stations with a fine&#8209;toothed comb” to establish their state. The </p>
<p>UK had not visited many of the stations for six months, following the Jameat incident </p>
<p>described earlier in this Section.</p>
<p><b>1255. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff continued:</p>
<p>“We surged police training teams in, Royal Military Police and contract policemen </p>
<p>from elsewhere.”</p>
<p><b>1256. </b> ACM Stirrup visited Iraq from 24 to 26 September and wrote to Mr Browne on </p>
<p>the day after his return to give him “an early feel” for some of his conclusions.</p>
<p>1169</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>considered that “the proposals for cleaning up individual police stations and culling/</p>
<p>retraining the force are good” but would have no long&#8209;term impact unless the “killers” </p>
<p>in the SCU were dealt with. </p>
<p><b>1257. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff reported on 28 September that Op SINBAD had begun, and that </p>
<p>initial operations had gone exceptionally well:</p>
<p>“What made a particular impact was the very evident Iraqi face on the operation, </p>
<p>both in the form of Iraqi sappers</p>
<p>1170</p>
<p> working alongside British sappers and Iraqi Army </p>
<p>security patrols on the streets alongside MNF.”</p>

<p><b>1258. </b> General Sir Nicholas Houghton described Op SINBAD to the Inquiry as the “last </p>
<p>best operation” to provide:</p>
<p>“… sort of exemplar modelling to the Iraqi Army but trying to put them in the lead of </p>
<p>it. In the latter stages of SINBAD, it became important that they were seen to be in </p>
<p>the lead …”</p>
<p>1172</p>
<p><b>1259. </b> Gen Houghton described the “instantaneous” follow&#8209;up “of police reform, with </p>
<p>police reform teams going into areas of Basra as they were cleared and made more </p>
<p>stable by Iraqi Army back&#8209;filling”.</p>
<p><b>1260. </b> On 27 October, Mr Banner wrote to Mr Siddiq, summarising a briefing that </p>
<p>Mr Asquith had given Mr Blair the previous day.</p>
<p>1173</p>
<p> Mr Blair had been told: </p>
<p>“The Iraqi Army had performed well in some areas (e.g. 10th Division in Basra). </p>
<p>But it lacked maturity, had poor mechanism for civilian control and direction, and </p>
<p>equipment was unevenly distributed and sometimes inadequate to task.” </p>
<p><b>1261. </b> Mr Blair requested further advice on how to strengthen the Iraqi Army and Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki’s control of it. A copy of the note was sent to the MOD for action. </p>
<p><b>1262. </b> The MOD replied on 9 November.</p>
<p>1174</p>
<p> With respect to MND(SE), the MOD stated </p>
<p>that 10th Division’s planned development was “on track” but that it was: </p>
<p>“… consistently placed at the bottom of the prioritisation list by Baghdad due to the </p>
<p>perceived low threat in Southern Iraq. As a result, they are potentially outgunned by </p>
<p>insurgents and remain vulnerable when moving by vehicle.” </p>
<p><b>1263. </b> The MOD wrote that it was “scoping the possibility of gifting 250 armoured </p>
<p>protection vehicles” to “enhance” 10th Division’s capacity. It stated that Enhanced </p>
<p>Military Training Teams (Super MiTTs) would “evolve” to “protect and enhance the </p>
<p>progress already made” when units were transferred to Iraqi control. Those Super </p>
<p>MiTTs were not described in any further detail. </p>
<p><b>1264. </b> Reflecting on the Iraqi Army’s performance in his evidence to the Inquiry, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Shirreff said:</p>
<p>“[The Iraqi Army] improved in terms of confidence, in terms of training, </p>
<p>immeasurably, I think, during the period of SINBAD, but they were not up to holding </p>
<p>in security terms, because, ultimately, however confident they got, you have </p>
<p>to remember that the Iraqi Army in south&#8209;east Iraq were Shia&#8209;recruited, locally </p>

<p>1175</p>
<p><b>1265. </b> On 16 November at DOP(I), VAdm Style stated that ISF would be in the lead of </p>
<p>Op SINBAD pulses from the end of the month and that they would be fully in charge of </p>
<p>the operation, including planning, by the end of February.</p>
<p>1176</p>
<p> He described Op SINBAD </p>
<p>as a “considerable success” but stated that progress on reforming the police remained </p>
<p>weak. </p>
<p><b>1266. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, VAdm Style described some of the achievements </p>
<p>of Op SINBAD:</p>
<p>“… a new level of co&#8209;operation between our own forces and the Iraqi Army, better </p>
<p>Iraqi Army and police co&#8209;operation … extra equipment was brought in … By the </p>
<p>end … the Iraqis were in the lead to an extent they had not been before.”</p>
<p>1177</p>
<p><b>1267. </b> On 30 November, Maj Gen Shirreff reported that Op SINBAD was progressing </p>
<p>well and considered future plans:</p>
<p>“Op SINBAD has led to improvements both in the general security situation (as </p>
<p>evidenced by the declining murder rate) and the confidence and capability of the </p>
<p>ISF. Mentoring of the Provincial Joint Coordination Centre by MND(SE) has led to </p>
<p>noticeable improvements in its ability to plan and coordinate operations. Similarly </p>
<p>the mentoring and training conducted by the police transition teams have led to </p>
<p>an improvement in the average transition readiness assessment … I assess that </p>
<p>as SINBAD culminates we will be able to say, quite reasonably, that the security </p>
<p>framework we have established in Basra will set the conditions for PIC.</p>
<p>“With regards to corrupt IPS, the DIA have already started tackling corrupt policemen </p>
<p>but they are a small team and it will take time before they have a significant effect. </p>
<p>In the meantime I have had my staff refine our plans to deal with the Serious Crimes </p>
<p>Unit (SCU), the largest and most dangerous of the corrupt IPS units, with support </p>
<p>from elements of the ISF. My intention is to replace the SCU with a new unit – the </p>
<p>MCU (Major Crimes Unit). The first phase will be to secure the new location (the </p>
<p>Warren) and to screen those already at the site. The Jameat police station (the </p>
<p>present site of the SCU) will be cleared once the Warren is secure and those </p>
<p>present will be assessed, the ineffective will be removed/transferred and the known </p>
<p>criminal element will be arrested. Finally those selected for the MCU will be carefully </p>
<p>screened and those that pass will be closely monitored, mentored and trained.”</p>

<p><b>1271. </b> CC Kernaghan was accompanied on the visit by the Police and Justice Team </p>
<p>Leader from the FCO’s Conflict Issues Group, who reported: </p>
<p>“The IPS is widely recognised as an integral part of the security problem, exhibiting </p>
<p>a serious propensity to undermine, rather than enforce, law and order. It barely </p>
<p>functions in Basra, suffering from a paralysing combination of deeply embedded </p>
<p>corruption (including involvement in extra&#8209;judicial killings), militia infiltration, poor </p>
<p>leadership (the recently confirmed Chief of Police, Al Hamadi, appears to inspire </p>
<p>little loyalty), and weak command and control structures. The dearth of local IPS </p>
<p>officers willing to staff the nascent Internal Affairs Department illustrates the depth </p>
<p>of the problem; recruits have finally been found, following MOI intervention, in a </p>
<p>nearby province.</p>
<p>“The early stages of SINBAD have confirmed the extremely poor state of the IPS. </p>
<p>From an over&#8209;complex and over&#8209;staffed organisational structure lacking basic </p>
<p>administrative capacity, to the decaying police stations with no mains electricity and </p>

<p>Extend the window of opportunity offered by Operation SINBAD by re&#8209;deploying </p>
<p>a number of UK police officers more directly in support of efforts to tackle gross </p>
<p>IPS corruption, the key obstacle to longer&#8209;term improvement of the IPS;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increase UK strategic policing input at the MOI in Baghdad, to support the </p>

<p>CIVILIAN DRAWDOWN</p>
<p><b>1274. </b> Mrs Beckett decided in October that the majority of civilian staff should be </p>
<p>withdrawn from Basra Palace and relocated to Basra Air Station.</p>
<p>1185</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1275. </b> In an IPU paper considering the impact of that drawdown it was assessed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ACC Barton and a small number of police advisers already based at Basra Air </p>
<p>Station would be unaffected.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The key current task for the remaining police advisers in Basra was work to </p>
<p>support Op SINBAD for which they needed to be based in Basra Palace or </p>
<p>another MND(SE) site in the city. The TIPS programme, run out of the PJCC </p>
<p>(co&#8209;located with the Basra Police Headquarters) would also be affected.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prisons work would be affected as Iraqi Corrections Service staff preferred to </p>
<p>visit Basra Palace than from Basra Air Station, and unannounced prison visits </p>
<p>were also more easily made from Basra Palace than Basra Air Station.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would be a negative impact on the Rule of Law work being carried out by </p>
<p>the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT).</p>
<p>1186</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1276. </b> The IPU recommended that the police team at Basra Palace should be reduced </p>
<p>by 14 officers, three of whom would relocate to the Air Station. The remainder would </p>
<p>leave Iraq. That would “retain just enough officers in the city to provide essential support </p>
<p>to Op SINBAD”. The prisons team would leave theatre “pending progress on the Basra </p>
<p>Central Prison project” and “we would need to think hard about whether the PRT could </p>
<p>have enough real impact to justify the costs and risks of maintaining it at its current size.”</p>
<p><b>1277. </b> Brigadier James Everard, Commander 20 Brigade, reporting in place of </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shirreff, expressed concern that that move would have a negative effect on </p>
<p>SSR work, making it impossible to train the specialist police teams that would take over </p>
<p>from the corrupt SCU and hampering the planned move of Iraqi prisoners out of the </p>
<p>Jameat facility into a new facility.</p>
<p>1187</p>
<p><b>1278. </b> Brig Everard also reported the murder of 17 Iraqi interpreters and locally </p>
<p>employed contractors employed at the Basra Police Academy. He advised: </p>
<p>“How the ISF (particularly the police) deal with this incident should be an important </p>
<p>test. Unsurprisingly, they may disappoint. There is a lack of IPS will to prosecute a </p>
<p>JAM&#8209;linked case with much vigour, let alone conduct any arrests.” </p>
<p><b>1279. </b> A paper drafted on 30 December by the Deputy Chief Police Adviser proposed </p>

<p>353</p>
<p><b>1284. </b> The November 2006 ‘Police Forward Look’ included the target of replacing “the </p>
<p>corrupt and dangerous SCU”.</p>
<p>1192</p>
<p> The plan was:</p>
<p>“Two hundred people to be disciplined, removed or prosecuted, then seek PDoP’s </p>
<p>[Provincial Director of Police’s] and Governor’s agreement to close down and </p>
<p>establish MCU [a Major Crimes Unit] in new location. Close down the Jameat </p>
<p>(present site of the SCU). Realistically, only aim to get the MCU the best possible </p>
<p>start, then hand over to Iraqi control immediately at PIC.”</p>
<p><b>1285. </b> That work would be undertaken by ArmorGroup contractors.</p>
<p><b>1286. </b> On 15 December, a junior official at the PJHQ briefed Mr Browne on Op SINBAD </p>
<p>and the plans to deal with the SCU based at Jameat Police Station.</p>
<p>1193</p>
<p> The briefing did </p>
<p>not suggest a real improvement in the overall capability of Basra’s IPS stations: while </p>
<p>prior to Op SINBAD stations had an average of TRA level 3 or worse, the average was </p>
<p>now assessed at between 2 and 3 with “some inconsistencies” between stations. It did, </p>
<p>however, state that the PJCC’s “command ability to plan and co&#8209;ordinate operations </p>
<p>throughout the city” was “much improved” due to the permanent presence of the MNF </p>
<p>at the centre. </p>
<p><b>1287. </b> The PJHQ official assessed the SCU as “so thoroughly tainted by corrupt officers </p>
<p>that it is effectively beyond gradual reform” and that orders had now been given by </p>
<p>the MOI and Prime Minister Maliki for it to be disbanded. The new Operation THYME </p>
<p>was being planned by Maj Gen Shirreff to disband the SCU, clear its headquarters and </p>
<p>remove all prisoners at the Jameat. The existing 200 SCU personnel would either:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be detained (only if “sufficient targetable intelligence” existed);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>have their case handed to the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) (where no </p>
<p>“targetable” evidence existed but there was information suggesting the individual </p>
<p>had been involved in criminal activity); or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>moved to other parts of the IPS and given further training (if not suspected of </p>
<p>any criminal activity).</p>
<p><b>1288. </b> The PJHQ official said that where individuals were dismissed from the IPS, </p>
<p>continued biometric testing from the IPS should prevent them from being re&#8209;employed, </p>
<p>although that was only possible if the Iraqis continued “to implement a stringent and </p>
<p>routine testing regime”. The new MCU would be formed at the PJCC made up of </p>
<p>120 individuals selected by the PTT following “a rigorous screening process”.</p>
<p><b>1289. </b> Op THYME was carried out on 25 December.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>had been attacked a number of times, resulting in a “very minor” MNF casualty and </p>
<p>“some vehicle damage”. Seven attackers had been killed. </p>
<p><b>1290. </b> The PJHQ official stated that 127 prisoners were found and that the Iraqi Army </p>
<p>had transferred them to the Warren facility. “Some 80 percent” of the prisoners “showed </p>
<p>signs of torture”. A search of the Jameat site uncovered weapons, grenades, shells and </p>
<p>bomb&#8209;making equipment. The MNF demolished part of the building to prevent it from </p>
<p>being reoccupied. </p>
<p><b>1291. </b> There had been a mixed reaction from the Iraqi Government to the operation. A </p>
<p>spokesperson from the IMOD had reiterated that the Iraqi Army was involved; making </p>
<p>clear that the MNF did not act alone. Governor Waili and tribal leaders had offered “very </p>
<p>strong support” but some of those briefed on the operation beforehand had since said </p>
<p>they were unaware of the MNF’s intent. That was believed to be due to militia pressure.</p>
<p><b>1292. </b> Reflecting on the Iraqi reaction to Op THYME, Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Maliki was generally supportive, Governor Waili was delighted, the tribal sheikhs </p>
<p>within Basra were delighted, the principal cleric of the largest Shia mosque in Basra, </p>
<p>with a congregation of 10,000 people on Friday prayers, thanked me for delivering </p>
<p>the people of Basra from this nest of vipers.”</p>
<p>1195</p>
<p><b>1293. </b> On 28 December, Mr Dominic Meiklejohn, Deputy Consul General in Basra, </p>
<p>described the ISF’s role in Op THYME as “significant”.</p>
<p>1196</p>
<p> The performance of Brigadier </p>
<p>Ibrahim, the only member of the Basra Security Committee in the country, had been </p>
<p>“less encouraging”, getting “cold feet at the last moment” and ordering a Commander </p>
<p>of 10th Division not to participate. Consequently, the brigade failed to provide the outer </p>
<p>cordon as planned.</p>
<p><b>1294. </b> Mr Meiklejohn reported that Prime Minister Maliki had claimed not to know about </p>
<p>the operation, despite it being raised with him on three separate occasions. Some </p>
<p>members of the Provincial Council had criticised the operation publicly but those were </p>
<p>the “usual suspects”. At a local, tactical level reactions had been positive, and although </p>
<p>local media had suggested the IPS would no longer be participating in Op SINBAD, the </p>
<p>PTTs had been “welcomed warmly” at police stations. He wrote:</p>
<p>“… excising the SCU has demonstrated that MNF and ISF have the will and capacity </p>
<p>to root out militia influence over the IPS. The SCU were not the only offenders but </p>
<p>had become a signal of what was wrong with the IPS. The operation … sent a </p>
<p>powerful signal to Basra.</p>
<p>“There is still much to do. MNF operations against the Shia militias remain outside </p>
<p>[Prime Minister] Maliki’s comfort zone. Local ISF commanders are scared of being </p>

<p>of the pain by doing even more to keep Maliki … in the loop (and paying the price </p>
<p>in operational security – the fact that no members of the SCU were caught in the </p>
<p>Jameat suggests they were warned off). But we can’t make Maliki more determined </p>
<p>or happier to confront the Shia militias. And we can’t get to PIC unless we can show </p>
<p>that the ISF are ready and able to confront the militias.” </p>
<p><b>1295. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff, also reporting on Op THYME on 28 December, wrote that the </p>
<p>operation “may mark a decisive moment, if not <i>the</i> decisive act in our efforts to reform </p>
<p>the IPS in Basra”.</p>
<p>1197</p>
<p> He thought it “brought to a head the hard choices that face the </p>
<p>Provincial Council, the Basra Security Committee and the ISF: do they confront or </p>
<p>continue to roll over in the face of the militia?”</p>
<p><b>1296. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff criticised Maj Gen Latif for refusing to order a brigade to deploy </p>
<p>into an area, because JAM was there with Rocket Propelled Grenades and small arms. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shirreff considered the Basra Security Committee “no longer fit for purpose” </p>
<p>after two members deserted the Committee during the operation and Brig Ibrahim </p>
<p>denied “any foreknowledge having previously been in full support”. </p>
<p><b>1297. </b> On 4 January 2007, Maj Gen Shirreff reported that the relationship with the </p>
<p>Council remained tense, with all members refusing to meet the MNF face to face.</p>
<p>1198</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was concerned about the welfare of the prisoners after SCU members had arrived </p>
<p>to work at the Warren facility. While prisoners had not been subject to further torture, </p>
<p>they had not received access to medical care or legal advice. The Director of Police had </p>
<p>assured he would keep SCU out of the Warren because it was not possible to be sure </p>
<p>who had been involved in the torture of prisoners. </p>
<p><b>1298. </b> The consequences of Op THYME continued as members of the Provincial </p>
<p>Council refused to engage fully with the MNF.</p>
<p>1199</p>
<p> They rejected evidence that the </p>
<p>MNF had authority for the operation and denied being briefed about it beforehand. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shirreff believed it was “absolutely clear” that that was due to fear of reprisals </p>
<p>from JAM and SCU.</p>
<p><b>1299. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry about how Op THYME affected Op SINBAD:</p>
<p>“… there was some delay … but … there was no significant impact on SINBAD at </p>
<p>all. In fact, in a sense it allowed us to continue that process which had begun to </p>

<p>EARLY ASSESSMENTS OF IRAQI SECURITY FORCE PERFORMANCE IN </p>

<p><b>1300. </b> On 4 January 2007, Maj Gen Shirreff reported that the Iraqi Ground Forces </p>

<p>1201</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shirreff stated: </p>
<p>“I am content, but on the condition that Latif is replaced and the Army does not </p>
<p>accept orders from the Basra Security Committee.” </p>
<p><b>1301. </b> On the No.10 copy of Maj Gen Shirreff’s report, Sir Nigel Sheinwald commented </p>
<p>that, while there was some positive news in it, “the worst … is left to the end and is a </p>
<p>big problem”.</p>
<p>1202</p>
<p><b>1302. </b> Lt Gen Lamb produced an update on ISF capabilities on 5 January 2007.</p>
<p>1203</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On equipment, he wrote that the Iraqi Government did not view 10th Division as “a </p>
<p>relatively high priority for investment” because their ratings and manning levels were </p>
<p>“significantly higher than other Divisions on a number of criteria”. If the UK was to lobby </p>
<p>the IMOD and MNSTC&#8209;I for equipment, Lt Gen Lamb advised: </p>
<p>“… this needs to be done in the full knowledge that it distorts the prioritisation and </p>
<p>investment system that we have encouraged the Iraqis to develop and meet their </p>
<p>national needs as a whole; expect push back from US and ISF commanders.” </p>
<p><b>1303. </b> The manuscript comment on Lt Gen Lamb’s assessment of the priorities for </p>
<p>investment said: “We have to make this up then.” The MOD has been unable to identify </p>

<p>Both the Iraqi Army and the IPS are increasingly taking the lead following </p>
<p>Op SINBAD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cleaning up the police is “at the heart of our current work”.</p>

<p><b>1305. </b> On 10 January, the MOD produced an update on UK military plans for transition </p>
<p>for DOP(I).</p>
<p>1205</p>
<p> An annex provided an interim assessment of Op SINBAD. It stated that </p>
<p>a clearer review would be available in March but that there were a number of positive </p>
<p>outcomes as well as some areas requiring more work. </p>
<p><b>1306. </b> The annex noted that police effectiveness had increased; it was currently </p>
<p>assessed as 69 percent capable and was on track for the 72 percent capability required </p>
<p>for transition. But parts of the IPS remained “actively criminal” and harboured the “Death </p>
<p>Squads responsible for a large proportion of the murder rate in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>1307. </b> The Iraqi Army had taken the lead through the latter stages of Op SINBAD and </p>
<p>was able to respond to requests for assistance through MND(SE). It still lacked the </p>
<p>“capability, structurally and conceptually” to deploy nationwide. </p>
<p><b>1308. </b> Op SINBAD had also “confirmed suspicions that some leaders in parts of the </p>
<p>Iraqi security sector in MND(SE) are not fit for task, including members of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army and the Basra Security Committee”. </p>
<p><b>1309. </b> DOP(I) considered the paper on 11 January.</p>
<p>1206</p>
<p><b>1310. </b> The minutes recorded that, although arrest warrants had been issued for </p>
<p>members of the SCU, they had not been actioned and there were signs that those </p>
<p>members were “continuing to operate”. The UK would continue to press Mr Boulani, </p>
<p>and the mentoring effort in the MOI should be increased.</p>
<p><b>1311. </b> Cabinet discussed Op SINBAD and transition in Basra later that day.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>358</p>
<p>despite reported comments by the former Commander of 4 Brigade that up to </p>
<p>50 percent of his unit was sympathetic to JAM, they successfully and impartially </p>
<p>policed a cease&#8209;fire in Amara between JAM and Badr. In Operation SINBAD in </p>
<p>Basra units conducted cordon and search operations independently and effectively </p>
<p>and in one instance intervened in a public order disturbance. We judge 10th</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Division </p>
<p>is slowly improving and gaining confidence, but it remains prone to interference from </p>
<p>local government and militia pressure. It is likely to prove fragile if confronted by </p>
<p>serious Shia militia violence.”</p>
<p>1208</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1314. </b> On 18 January, Dr Rosalind Marsden, Consul General in Basra, produced </p>
<p>the first consolidated weekly report from MND(SE).</p>
<p>1209</p>
<p> She highlighted a number of </p>
<p>difficulties including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Provincial Council’s disengagement with MNF; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a requirement to replace or dissolve the Emergency Security Committee;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a requirement to appoint a new Chief of Police; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a continued need to tackle death squads and high&#8209;level corruption in the police. </p>
<p><b>1315. </b> In contrast to the MOD’s assessment that 69 percent of police stations were at a </p>
<p>level sufficient for transition, Dr Marsden assessed that 56 percent were ready and that </p>
<p>police trainers had been able to operate normally in 80 percent of the stations visited – </p>
<p>in others “they have been turned away politely”. Dr Marsden also stated that the transfer </p>
<p>of land to allow construction of a new Central Prison for Basra had finally been agreed in </p>
<p>December 2006. </p>
<p><b>1316. </b> In his end of tour report, dated 19 January, Maj Gen Shirreff stated:</p>
<p>“Mission success for Britain depends on a capable, confident IA and the last six </p>
<p>months has witnessed both highs and lows. The mutiny of 2/4/10 [2nd Battalion, </p>
<p>4th Brigade, 10th Division] and the failure of 4 (IA) Bde [4th Brigade] to control </p>
<p>the looting of Camp Abu Naji in August were the obvious lows and demonstrated </p>
<p>that the ‘hands off’ approach to training the IA adopted by the UK was inadequate. </p>
<p>Arguably, no other army in the world has greater depth of experience in training </p>
<p>indigenous armies than the British and yet we have not been true to ourselves. We </p>
<p>have not lived, trained and fought alongside them, preferring a centralised MiTT and </p>
<p>a far more hands off approach, in contrast to our US allies. Effectively the stabilisers </p>
<p>were removed from the bike too early. The result has been a lacklustre, inadequately </p>
<p>trained and supported Division that failed the test when it came.</p>
<p>“Subsequent to these failures, SINBAD has, for the most part, done much to </p>
<p>improve IA capability and confidence … We finish SINBAD with the IA in the lead. </p>
<p>However, until the IA in Basra is prepared to fight JAM, the ISF will not be capable </p>

<p>at the top and it is the best possible news that Latif, CG 10 (IA) Div [Commander </p>
<p>General 10th Division], who has proved to be worse than useless, is to be shifted … </p>
<p>if we are to get the IA right, it means accepting the risk of much greater embedding </p>
<p>within IA units. This, in turn, means not only living and training with them, but being </p>
<p>prepared to fight with them too.”</p>
<p>1210</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1317. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Shirreff said that Op SINBAD:</p>
<p>“… failed to achieve the security which was the original genesis of the plan, but it </p>
<p>achieved other things. I think it achieved an increased confidence among the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army. It certainly achieved a better standard, generally speaking, of Iraqi police, </p>
<p>in terms of the mechanistic boxes that needed to be ticked before Provincial Iraqi </p>
<p>Control should be established …”</p>
<p>1211</p>
<p><b>1318. </b> On 25 January, Mr Browne briefed Cabinet that, in Basra: </p>
<p>“… the murder rate had reduced from over 100 to less than 30 a month, which </p>
<p>compared favourably with a number of European States and American cities. The </p>
<p>kidnap rate had been halved and polling suggested levels of confidence in security </p>
<p>which would be welcome in the UK; 90 percent of those polled felt more secure than </p>
<p>a year ago; only two percent had encountered intimidation in the last six months. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge was improvement in policing, but the police forces were only </p>
<p>a couple of percentage points below the benchmark set for transfer of security.”</p>
<p>1212</p>
<p><b>1319. </b> On 26 January, Lt Gen Lamb produced a report on ISF capability for Mr Blair.</p>
<p>1213</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He warned about the problems of gifting equipment in an attempt to fix capability gaps: </p>
<p>“This will only provide, perhaps, a marginal short term difference (usually offset </p>
<p>by IMOD to compensate against other national priorities) and is, in general, just </p>
<p>as likely to exacerbate the systemic issues already present in terms of logistic </p>
<p>support e.g. through multiple vehicle fleets or weapon systems. There are also other </p>
<p>additional factors … such directed gifting is likely to received pushback from both the </p>
<p>US and the Iraqis.”</p>
<p><b>1320. </b> In her weekly report dated 1 February, Dr Marsden warned that the formation </p>
<p>of the new Basra Crimes Unit (BCU) had stalled and that 400 members of the former </p>
<p>SCU were still turning up to claim wages and entering buildings designated for the new </p>
<p>BCU.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>the Warren was critical and that “DIA concerns … were not allayed when they made the </p>
<p>trip with Iraqi Army backup and were confronted by SCU officers”. She noted that the </p>
<p>Basra Police Academy had gone into decline since it was transferred to Iraqi control in </p>
<p>December 2006.</p>
<p><b>1321. </b> On 9 February, Dr Marsden sought to explain the apparent difference between </p>
<p>improving Transitional Readiness Assessments of the police and the more qualitative </p>
<p>assessment by those on the ground that the police force had become less effective.</p>
<p>1215</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She stated: </p>
<p>“The measurement of transition readiness levels (defined by CPATT) is mainly based </p>
<p>on quantitative indicators such as who has been given what training, whether or not </p>
<p>police stations are producing the requisite reports, following the right procedures and </p>
<p>performing basic police business and whether they are properly equipped. It does </p>
<p>not include a moral component.</p>
<p>“On the positive side, we have trained and trained the lower echelons of the Basra </p>
<p>police (11,500 in the Shaibah college alone). They have all been equipped with </p>
<p>guns, cars and uniforms. There are some good units in the Basra police and a </p>
<p>number of good, professional middle&#8209;ranking police officers, trying to do a good </p>
<p>job. But the Basra police also includes an influential minority of seriously criminal </p>
<p>and corrupt individuals and a large number of officers (probably the majority) who </p>
<p>are more or less adequate but stifled by weak leadership and intimidated by the </p>
<p>seriously corrupt elements and militant militias.</p>
<p>“The real problem is the high level of … serious police related crime … This is </p>
<p>evidenced by the recent interviews carried out by the Department of Internal Affairs </p>
<p>with tortured prisoners from the Jameat. There is evidence that some police officers </p>
<p>are also directly involved in anti&#8209;MNF activity. These criminal elements are a big </p>
<p>part of the problem on the streets, although the size of that problem is not massive </p>
<p>compared to Baghdad.” </p>
<p><b>1322. </b> Gen Dannatt visited Iraq from 14 to 15 February.</p>
<p>1216</p>
<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“For MND(SE), 10 IA Div clearly represent the exit strategy not only from Basra </p>
<p>City but elsewhere across the region … the fear is that 10 IA Div may not be as </p>
<p>good as we hoped it would be … But as GOC MND(SE) rightly observed, we have </p>
<p>regularly changed the role for which these troops were designed; they have gone </p>
<p>from local militia (ICDC), to regional defence force and now onto an expeditionary </p>
<p>footing … over the past three and a half years. However, we are where we are; the </p>
<p>trick now is to maintain sufficient SSR momentum to get 10 IA Div at the level of </p>
<p>combat effectiveness appropriate to its future role against the predicted threat. And </p>
<p>GOC MND(SE) is looking carefully at this. It is not simply a question of enhancing </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1323. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Former Chief Superintendent Barton said that, by </p>
<p>early 2007, “the security situation had worsened so much that it was impossible to move </p>
<p>around the city in anything other than a Warrior”.</p>
<p>1217</p>
<p> He wrote that due to the security </p>
<p>risk, inspection visits “would often be as short as twenty minutes”; in comparison, an </p>
<p>inspection at a UK station would take “at least one full day”.</p>
<p><b>10th Division called to Baghdad</b></p>
<p>In his weekly report from 31 January, Major General Jonathan Shaw, GOC MND(SE) </p>
<p>from January 2007 until August 2007, reported that elements of 10th Division were likely </p>
<p>to be called to Baghdad in the near future for a combat role.</p>
<p>1218</p>
<p> He assessed: “while the </p>
<p>10th Division has proven itself capable of basic tasks … they are not yet combat proven. </p>
<p>Asking them to deploy to Baghdad in this role at this stage risks asking too much of them.”</p>
<p>Two battalions of 10th Division were expected to move north in support of the Baghdad </p>
<p>Security Plan in late February.</p>
<p>1219</p>
<p> Each battalion was to be accompanied by a team of four </p>
<p>“military observers”</p>
<p>1220</p>
<p> who would “co&#8209;locate with US forces”.</p>
<p>On 12 February, MOD officials recommended that two four&#8209;man UK teams should embed </p>
<p>alongside US MiTTs with the two 10th Division battalions being deployed to Baghdad.</p>
<p>1221</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By 21 February, plans had expanded to include a UK team of 24 based at Besmaya (from </p>
<p>where ISF were being forward deployed to Baghdad) to help the US prepare other ISF </p>
<p>units for the Baghdad Security Plan.</p>
<p>1222</p>
<p>In his evidence to the Inquiry, Major General Graham Binns, GOC MND(SE) from August </p>
<p>2007 until February 2008, recalled:</p>
<p>“… when the unit that we had trained from 10 Division deployed to Baghdad, we </p>
<p>mentored and we sent mentoring teams with them to Baghdad … this was something </p>
<p>that had evolved in Basra but not Baghdad.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>362</p>
<p><b>1325. </b> At the Iraq Senior Officials Group on 12 January, Mr Howard pointed out that </p>
<p>weekly reporting would be difficult as information was produced by the US on a monthly </p>
<p>basis so little would change from week to week.</p>
<p>1225</p>
<p> Monthly reports would therefore be </p>
<p>more sensible.</p>
<p><b>1326. </b> On 22 January, Mr Banner wrote to departments thanking them for a series </p>
<p>of papers and asked that the next report on ISF capabilities include more detailed </p>
<p>recommendations on addressing shortfalls and bottlenecks.</p>
<p>1226</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1327. </b> On 26 January, Mr Banner provided Mr Blair with a number of updates.</p>
<p>1227</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>judged that the Basra update and the ISF capabilities update suggested that “all is not </p>
<p>well with 10th Division, including on equipment (we need to work out how this squares </p>
<p>with CDS’s assurance that all they were lacking is a water truck)”. </p>
<p><b>1328. </b> On 24 January, Mr Browne wrote to Mr Blair to update him on the rationale </p>
<p>behind a planned reduction in troops from 7,000 to 4,500&#8209;5,000 (this is also addressed </p>
<p>in Section 9.5).</p>
<p>1228</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“There is no question of us leaving a vacuum in the city, as the IA and IPS are </p>
<p>already doing patrols and we will remain present in the Provincial Joint Co&#8209;ordination </p>
<p>Centre and military transition teams. Early evidence from the final stages of </p>
<p>Op SINBAD, where the IA are in some areas not just in the lead but doing it by </p>
<p>themselves, is that inevitably they enjoy a greater level of consent than we do – but </p>
<p>also that they are doing a decent job. They are far from the finished article but after </p>
<p>re&#8209;posturing our shift towards mentoring and support will ensure they continue to </p>
<p>develop.</p>
<p>“The clear military advice … is that re&#8209;posturing and the associated drawdown will </p>
<p>not adversely affect our capacity to provide support to the Iraqi Security Forces, </p>
<p>including underwriting it by providing a battlegroup size reserve force. We must </p>
<p>recognise that after re&#8209;posturing re&#8209;intervention would not be straightforward but this </p>
<p>is a nettle that must be grasped at some stage.</p>
<p>“We should explain what these 4,500&#8209;5,000 personnel will be doing … The answer is </p>
<p>that as well as holding a battlegroup in reserve … Security Sector Reform will once </p>
<p>again be the main focus – reflected in an increase in our commitment to military and </p>
<p>police training teams. In relation to the Police in particular – an area where I know </p>
<p>the Americans have concerns – we have … done a considerable amount to clean </p>
<p>up the police in Basra, but making it stick now depends mainly on the Iraqi MOI and </p>
<p>Emergency Security Committee acting on outstanding arrest warrants … </p>

<p>“Finally, given the importance right now of the Iraqis being able to assume the </p>
<p>lead, we should take the opportunity to deal with the public demands which PM </p>
<p>Maliki made last week on equipment – repeating in public what he has said to us </p>
<p>in private. In fact, the position in IA 10 Div is relatively good, but the Iraqis continue </p>
<p>to look for symbols of force to over&#8209;face the militia. We have managed to bring </p>
<p>forward the deployment of some 240 Humvee vehicles – 140 are now in place – and </p>
<p>we are expecting some heavy calibre arms over the next month. On my visit I will </p>
<p>again press Defence Minister Qadir to spend his capital budget wisely and quickly </p>
<p>including for 10 Div.”</p>
<p><b>1329. </b> On 29 January, Mr Banner requested further details from the MOD on equipment </p>
<p>issues and MiTTing (as support for police reform).</p>
<p>1229</p>
<p><b>1330. </b> On 30 January, Mr Banner briefed the Prime Minister that one of the two “key </p>
<p>issues” for the US was that the UK should have “an embedding/MiTT programme similar </p>
<p>to their own”.</p>
<p>1230</p>
<p> The MOD was “working on this” but was, Mr Banner felt, “reluctant”.</p>
<p><b>1331. </b> Mr Blair met Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, Chief of Joint Operations, </p>
<p>and senior officials from FCO and SIS to discuss the situation in Basra on 31 January.</p>
<p>1231</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The issue of embedding mentors was raised. Lt Gen Houghton explained that the UK </p>
<p>approach to mentoring in Basra was different to that being developed by the US, in </p>
<p>part because of a differing context; the US were primarily embedding with Shia forces </p>
<p>operating in hostile Sunni areas, whereas the UK was working with Shia forces in Shia </p>
<p>areas. He stated: “We, not they, drew the fire of local militias”, hence most UK mentoring </p>
<p>would take place at headquarters level and at bases.</p>
<p><b>1332. </b> Mr Blair also expressed concern about the Iraqi ability to ensure security </p>
<p>after re&#8209;posturing. Lt Gen Houghton noted that the UK would retain a re&#8209;intervention </p>
<p>capability, and that it was “important to allow 10 Division to act independently”. He </p>
<p>conceded that there was still considerable work to be done to improve leadership in </p>
<p>10th Division and fill equipment gaps “where it was difficult to take bilateral action </p>
<p>specific to 10th Division, given the prioritisation system in place via MNSTC&#8209;I”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated that it was “essential that our plans resulted in a 10 Division that was able to </p>
<p>defeat JAM whenever it encountered them in an open fight. This would be the only way </p>
<p>to instil wider confidence in the security situation.”</p>
<p><b>1333. </b> The MOD responded to Mr Banner’s request on 2 February.</p>
<p>1232</p>
<p> On equipment, </p>
<p>the MOD denied that there were any shortages for 10th Division. It explained that </p>
<p>relevant training must take place before equipping could be completed, and that that </p>

<p><b>1334. </b> The MOD did acknowledge that corruption led to issued equipment being lost but </p>
<p>stated: “once equipment has been issued … there is little MND(SE) can do to oversee </p>
<p>the loss or relocation of such assets”.</p>
<p><b>1335. </b> On MiTTing, the MOD stated that US MiTT plans elsewhere in Iraq saw US </p>
<p>personnel directly embedded and serving alongside their Iraqi counterparts but the UK </p>
<p>approach differed:</p>
<p>“UK practice, and one we have adopted in numerous Military Assistance Missions </p>
<p>around the world, is focused on leadership and embedding UK personnel at brigade </p>
<p>and divisional level rather than in fighting units. It is possible that our slightly </p>
<p>different approach will attract criticism from the US and we will need to be ready to </p>
<p>explain our reasoning, which is, in large part, due to the different circumstances on </p>
<p>the ground in southern Iraq. 10 Division is more advanced than some Iraqi Army </p>
<p>divisions elsewhere and is already responsible for security in much of MND(SE) </p>
<p>outside Basra City. Embedded MiTTs may not, therefore be required or wanted </p>
<p>much by the Iraqi Army in Southern Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>1336. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lieutenent General Barney White&#8209;Spunner, </p>
<p>GOC MND(SE) from February 2008, described the US approach to MiTTing:</p>
<p>“It is an embedded military training team. So what the Americans had done with </p>
<p>the First Division, and indeed with most of their formations for which they were </p>
<p>responsible in the Iraqi Army, was they had put dedicated teams into that formation </p>
<p>who lived and worked with them. So when that formation deployed … it brought </p>
<p>those teams with it.”</p>

<p>average TRA level of 3.3 (out of 4) in September 2006.</p>
<p>“However, for all the efforts made, levels of trust in the police force remain low, and </p>
<p>some assessments indicate that the IPS continue to do more to undermine rather </p>
<p>than guarantee security.”</p>
<p><b>1338. </b> On the Iraqi Army, the paper stated that the main issue was the “quality of its </p>
<p>leadership, in addition to unwillingness to stand up to militia activity and a lack of </p>
<p>equipment”. To address concerns about 10th Division’s capabilities and readiness, a </p>
<p>“dedicated” SSR team of four MiTTs would be deployed, each comprising five or six </p>
<p>people, to carry out training at divisional and brigade level.</p>
<p><b>1339. </b> The paper noted that closing bases in the city would make any military </p>
<p>re&#8209;intervention high&#8209;risk. In the event of re&#8209;intervention, all training of the ISF would </p>
<p>have to cease until the operation was complete. Post&#8209;PIC plans for SSR depended on </p>
<p>a degree of freedom of movement in and around Basra, including a military and civilian </p>
<p>presence at the PJCC.</p>
<p><b>1340. </b> Mr Browne visited Iraq from 28 to 31 January (described in Section 9.5).</p>

<p> In a </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The leadership of Basra security structures was inadequate (a point </p>
<p>which he in turn raised with Prime Minister Maliki and Mr Abdel Qadir, Iraqi </p>
<p>Defence Minister).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US was not convinced about Basra being ready for transition or the </p>
<p>capability of the 10th Division.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Police Adviser felt the police were less effective than six months before </p>
<p>“principally because of intimidation rather than any lack of training or capability”. </p>
<p><b>1341. </b> Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary commented that those views seemed </p>
<p>to contradict the messages that had previously been received on the success of </p>
<p>Op SINBAD. There was “a lack of firm indicators to substantiate or refute” the different </p>
<p>conclusions.</p>
<p><b>1342. </b> In his update to DOP on 1 February, Mr Browne reported on his visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>1236</p>

<p>In Basra he had “seen first hand the positive effect that Operation SINBAD had had”; </p>
<p>the reported murder rate had reduced and “sectarian violence had almost stopped”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>366</p>
<p><b>Understanding the murder rate in Basra</b></p>
<p>On 1 February, Dr Marsden sought to provide context to the figures behind murder rates in </p>
<p>Basra.</p>
<p>1237</p>
<p> She wrote:</p>
<p>“Anecdotal evidence from Basrawi contacts and some other sources of information </p>
<p>suggest that levels of intimidation of Basrawis by JAM and other militias remain high. </p>
<p>Yet crime figures quoted in the 31 January DOP paper suggests that the reported </p>
<p>murder rate fell sharply in the second half of 2006.</p>
<p>“Confusingly there is no single collation point for recording crime in Basra. There are </p>
<p>currently two sets of crime figures in use: those produced by the PJCC (jointly run </p>
<p>by the IPS, IA and MNF) and those produced by the criminal statistics department </p>
<p>of the IPS. The IPS figures are based on crimes reported weekly by police stations </p>
<p>to the criminal statistics department in Police HQ. The PJCC figures are based on </p>
<p>emergency calls received from members of the public and (sporadic) radio reports </p>
<p>from individual police officers on the ground. They do not take account of police </p>
<p>station reports. Both sets of figures are incomplete because they do not include tribal </p>
<p>murders (in which the police do not get involved), many cases of family violence and </p>
<p>crimes committed by police officers themselves (a significant omission as many of the </p>
<p>murders in Basra are actually committed by the police themselves, notably the death </p>
<p>squads in the Serious Crimes Unit and certain other units).</p>
<p>“The reported murder and kidnapping rates quoted in the DOP paper are based on </p>
<p>PJCC figures. These show that the murder rate rose from around 50 a month in early </p>
<p>2006 to over 100 a month in the second quarter … declining to 30 in December 2006. </p>
<p>The IPS figures show a similar trend in the first half of the year, with the murder rate </p>
<p>peaking at over 100 a month in April&#8209;June 2006, but with a much less marked decline </p>
<p>in the second half of the year (to 80&#8209;90 murders a month in the last quarter of 2006).”</p>
<p><b>1343. </b> On 13 February, MOD officials provided a paper to DOP on how best to balance </p>
<p>military effort across Iraq and Afghanistan (see Section 9.5).</p>
<p>1238</p>
<p> The MOD said that </p>
<p>current plans were that, following re&#8209;posturing up to six UK military sub units</p>
<p>1239</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>three battlegroup headquarters would be available for ISF training. Specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>one company devoted to training the Iraqi Army at the Divisional Training Centre;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>one company to provide a “flying” MiTT to monitor and mentor the 1st and </p>
<p>4th Brigades of 10th Division;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>one company to support FCO&#8209;led Police Training Teams, based at the PJCC;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>up to two companies to provide training and assistance to the DBE in </p>
<p>border&#8209;related operations; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a company based at Basra Palace (until August) available to periodically </p>
<p>conduct training of the Iraqi Army.</p>

<p><b>1344. </b> In addition, smaller MiTTs would remain embedded with the Headquarters of </p>

<p><b>1345. </b> The MOD said that central to their re&#8209;posturing plans would be the release of </p>
<p>manpower to better focus on training for the IPS, Iraqi Army and DBE, concentrating </p>
<p>on the weakest areas of leadership and collective training.</p>
<p><b>1346. </b> To help Mr Blair draft a statement to Parliament on the latest military plans, the </p>
<p>MOD provided an update on Op SINBAD on 16 February.</p>
<p>1240</p>
<p> The paper described a </p>
<p>number of areas where progress had been achieved:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Experience of operations for the PJCC had improved the ISF’s ability to plan </p>
<p>and co&#8209;ordinate operations in the city. The paper did say that “given its central </p>
<p>importance PJCC mentoring will continue beyond SINBAD and PIC”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A reduction in reported crime. There was no mention of concerns over the </p>
<p>validity of those figures.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An improvement in basic police capability, although problems with leadership </p>
<p>and corruption were acknowledged and the paper later assessed that up to </p>
<p>75 percent of Basra IPS were members of a militia and “many” were linked to </p>
<p>criminal activity.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Army had reached the level required for PIC but “their ability to stand </p>
<p>up to militias unaided by coalition remains questionable”. </p>
<p><b>1347. </b> On 21 February, Mr Blair delivered his statement in Parliament: </p>
<p>“Since the outset, our plan, agreed by the United Nations, has been to build up Iraqi </p>
<p>capability in order to let Iraqis take control of their own destiny, and that as they </p>
<p>would step up, we would increasingly step back. For three years therefore, we have </p>
<p>been working to create, train and equip Iraqi security forces capable of taking on the </p>
<p>security of the country themselves.</p>
<p>“In normal circumstances, the progress would be considered remarkable. There </p>
<p>are now 10 Divisions of the new Iraqi Army and more than 130,000 soldiers, able in </p>
<p>significant parts of the country to provide order. There are 135,000 personnel in the </p>
<p>Iraqi Police Service. There, the progress has been more constrained, and frequently </p>
<p>hampered by corruption and sectarianism, but none the less, again, in normal </p>
<p>circumstances, it would be considered a remarkable effort. The plan of General </p>
<p>Petraeus … which was conceived in 2004, has in its essential respects been put </p>
<p>in place …</p>
<p>“Over the past months, we have been conducting an operation in Basra with the </p>
<p>10th Division of the Iraqi Army, to reach the stage where Basra can be secured </p>
<p>by the Iraqis themselves … </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>“As a result of the operation in Basra, which is now complete, the Iraq forces now </p>
<p>have the primary role for security in most parts of the city. It is still a difficult and </p>
<p>sometimes dangerous place, but many extremists have been arrested or have left </p>
<p>the city. The reported levels of murder and kidnapping are significantly down … </p>
<p>“What all this means is not that Basra is how we want it to be but that the next </p>
<p>chapter in Basra’s history can be written by the Iraqis … </p>
<p>“The British forces that remain in Iraq will have the following tasks: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training and support to Iraqi forces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>securing the Iraq&#8209;Iran border; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>securing supply routes; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>and, above all, the ability to conduct operations against extremist groups and </p>
<p>be there in support of the Iraqi Army when called upon. </p>
<p>“Over time, and depending naturally on progress and the capability of the Iraq </p>
<p>security forces, we will be able to draw down further, possibly to below 5,000 once </p>
<p>the Basra Palace site has been transferred to the Iraqis in late summer.”</p>
<p>1241</p>
<p>CONTINUING CONCERNS WITH THE BASRA JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IRAQI </p>
<p>POLICE SERVICE</p>
<p><b>1348. </b> The paper produced by the IPU and British Embassy Baghdad on 16 February </p>
<p>2007 described problems with Basra’s judicial system.</p>
<p>1242</p>
<p> There was “considerable </p>
<p>evidence of the extra&#8209;legal influence of political/religious factions on the judicial process”. </p>
<p>Those judges involved in combating corruption had expressed concern for their personal </p>
<p>safety and there was a lack of judicial control. </p>
<p><b>1349. </b> The paper included a recommendation that attempts to bring prosecutions in </p>
<p>IPS corruption cases should continue. A new Basra courthouse would be completed </p>
<p>by November 2007 and a 1,500&#8209;capacity prison would be created in Basra. Those </p>
<p>conclusions were reflected in the Better Basra Mark III plan (described later in this </p>
<p>Section).</p>
<p><b>1350. </b> On 26 February, in response to the latest weekly report from Dr Marsden, No.10 </p>
<p>wrote to departments:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is seized of the need to replace [Brigadier] Hamadi as Director </p>
<p>of Basra Police. We need to take urgent action with Maliki to underline the case </p>
<p>for this, and to ensure the effective functioning of the Serious Crimes Unit. The </p>

<p>personally.”</p>
<p>1243</p>
<p><b>1351. </b> In her report dated 28 February (dealt with in more detail in Section 9.5), </p>
<p>Dr Marsden wrote: </p>
<p>“While polling suggests that the IPS inspire confidence in about 65 percent of </p>
<p>the population … those questioned by British representatives said that the police </p>
<p>could not be trusted. Many told stories of intimidation and claimed knowledge </p>
<p>of kidnappings and death squads. Others said they would not call the police </p>
<p>emergency hotline to report criminal or terrorist activity for fear that policemen taking </p>
<p>the calls were in cahoots with the militias. Basrawis are willing to call the police to </p>
<p>report general crime but if criminals threatened them or their families, they are more </p>
<p>likely to turn to their tribe for help.”</p>
<p>1244</p>
<p>UPDATED BETTER BASRA PLAN</p>
<p><b>1352. </b> The third iteration of the Better Basra Plan, ‘Better Basra Mark III’, was sent by </p>
<p>Dr Marsden to Ms Aldred on 2 March.</p>
<p>1245</p>
<p> It is described more fully in Section 9.5.</p>
<p><b>1353. </b> It set out the combined military and civilian strategic priorities for Basra for the </p>
<p>coming six months. One of the indicators of success would be “Iraqi Government control </p>
<p>sustained after PIC with no breakdown of law and order”. The plan had a number of </p>
<p>subsections including “security” and “Rule of Law”.</p>
<p><b>1354. </b> The “security” aim was to “reduce the threat from illegal armed groups and Iranian </p>
<p>proxies and build the capacity of the Iraqi Army to take on militant JAM and conduct </p>
<p>their own Strike Operations”. The plan noted that, although the Iraqi Army had grown in </p>
<p>confidence during Op SINBAD, it would “certainly face stiffer tests in future”. To enhance </p>
<p>capability over the next six months the UK would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deploy MiTTs with 10th Division Iraqi Army units;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide further leadership training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>conduct more joint operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish Iraqi ownership and a relationship of trust with the Basra Emergency </p>
<p>Security Committee (assuming the Iraqi Government wished to maintain it); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>press the IMOD and the US to provide more equipment (particularly heavy </p>
<p>weapons) so that 10th Division felt sufficiently equipped to engage effectively.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>370</p>
<p><b>1355. </b> The aim for “Rule of Law” was to:</p>
<p>“… bring the Basra police to a ‘good enough’ standard to transition to PIC. Basra’s </p>
<p>population have the right to expect more of its police. The police should be able to </p>
<p>carry out basic policing tasks; Basrawis should feel that if they report a crime, it will </p>
<p>be acted on; the police should not be the home of organised death squads (although </p>
<p>it is unrealistic to expect zero corruption); and militia influence should not be at levels </p>
<p>where it is the dominant force in police stations.” </p>
<p><b>1356. </b> To achieve those aims, the UK would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support the DIA, based in a protected compound at Basra Air Station;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage the “pursuit” of the 62 death squad leaders from the SCU and NIIA </p>
<p>(of which three had already been arrested);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>press Baghdad to replace the weak Provincial Director of Police (PDoP);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve co&#8209;operation between the Basra police and the MOI in Baghdad;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue intensive mentoring of the PDoP and other senior IPS officers;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue monitoring and mentoring police stations to achieve 80 percent of </p>
<p>police stations at the level required for PIC;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage the removal of unqualified and poor performers;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish a properly vetted, fully professional Criminal Investigation Department;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mentor the Basra branch of the NIIA to try and ensure that criminal elements of </p>
<p>the CIU do not migrate into the unit; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide forensic capability at Basra Police Headquarters.</p>
<p><b>1357. </b> The plan described the judiciary as “weak and unable to prosecute serious crime”. </p>
<p>The aim was to “empower Basra’s judges and prosecutors to tackle serious crime </p>
<p>(particularly police corruption) in a more secure, less intimidating environment”. Priorities </p>
<p>for the next six months were to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>build the capacity of judges and others involved in the judicial process </p>
<p>through mentoring, specifically the Prosecution Mentoring Unit (staffed by </p>
<p>two international prosecutors funded by the plan);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish regional training programmes;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve security measures at the main Basra courthouse;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>build an additional courthouse, using US Department of Justice funding, which </p>
<p>would include witness protection facilities; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide scene of crime and forensic training for investigative judges and judicial </p>
<p>investigators.</p>
<p><b>1358. </b> Basra’s prisons were described as “old, overcrowded” and said to “not </p>
<p>meet minimum international human rights standards”. The aim was to “support </p>
<p>the development of an Iraqi Corrections System that complies with Iraqi law and </p>

<p>increasing prison capacity by building and commissioning a new US&#8209;funded </p>
<p>Basra Central Prison for 1,500 prisoners;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to strengthen the capacity of correctional services staff by </p>
<p>implementing a UK training programme and further mentoring; and</p>

<p>NATIONAL INFORMATION AND INVESTIGATION AGENCY RAID</p>
<p><b>1359. </b> On 3 March, Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF), supported by MNF troops, </p>
<p>carried out a raid on the National Information and Investigation Agency (NIIA) in </p>
<p>Basra.</p>
<p>1246</p>
<p><b>1360. </b> Mr Beadle wrote to No.10 about the raid in a letter dated 16 March.</p>
<p>1247</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>pre&#8209;planned operation was to detain an NIIA officer associated with death squads who </p>
<p>had been a “priority UK target for over two years”. The target was not present and the </p>
<p>raid resulted in the escape of around 30 prisoners (who had been tortured according to </p>
<p>some reports). </p>
<p><b>1361. </b> On 5 March, Prime Minister Maliki’s office issued a statement condemning the </p>
<p>raid as “illegal” and “irresponsible”. Mr Maliki ordered local security authorities, including </p>
<p>the police, to cease all “joint activities” with MND(SE) until further notice. </p>
<p><b>1362. </b> On the same day, Mr Maliki told Mr Asquith that he was disappointed at the </p>
<p>“reprehensible” way in which the raid had been conducted and the violation of Iraqi </p>
<p>sovereignty that it represented.</p>
<p>1248</p>
<p> He warned that the consequence of such operations </p>
<p>might be severe restrictions on the ability to deploy ISOF.</p>
<p><b>1363. </b> Three investigations resulted from the raid: one by the MOI, one led by </p>
<p>Mr Safa al&#8209;Safi (Prime Minister Maliki’s Ministerial Security Adviser on Basra) and one </p>
<p>by the MNF.</p>
<p>1249</p>
<p> The MNF was reviewing mechanisms for informing the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>of sensitive operations.</p>
<p><b>1364. </b> Maj Shaw wrote in his weekly report on 8 March:</p>

<p>than an obstacle …”</p>
<p>1250</p>
<p><b>1365. </b> Mr Bill Jeffrey, Permanent Under Secretary for the MOD from November 2005 </p>
<p>to October 2010, met Maj Gen Shaw during a visit to Iraq from 12 to 13 March.</p>
<p>1251</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw reported that the raid on the NIIA offices could “have been handled </p>
<p>better”, with hindsight, but that “most reactions by local political figures were either </p>
<p>somewhat synthetic or manageable”.</p>
<p><b>1366. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reflected on the raid in his evidence to the Inquiry.</p>
<p>1252</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p>“[It] was the one operation where they [the Iraqi Government] did object to it … that </p>
<p>raid … exposed the difficulties within the Shia polity again … It was a raid carried out </p>
<p>by the Iraqi special forces, so it was an Iraqi raid and it was trying very hard to abide </p>
<p>by or comply with Iraqi sovereignty.”</p>
<p><b>1367. </b> On 15 March, Maj Gen Shaw highlighted the importance of tackling violence not </p>
<p>directed at MNF and the difficulties of doing that, saying:</p>
<p>“The fundamental assumption behind the NIIA raid was that it was consistent with, </p>
<p>indeed in pursuit of, Iraqi sovereignty: that the nature of the target (known death </p>
<p>squad leader against whom an Iraqi judge had issued an arrest warrant) and the </p>
<p>method of arrest (ISOF, not MNF) would bring GoI buy&#8209;in, even though it was within </p>
<p>a building owned by the IPS (which PM Maliki … acknowledged to be corrupt).”</p>
<p>1253</p>
<p><b>1368. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reflected on how the NIIA incident illustrated concerns about </p>
<p>transition:</p>
<p>“It is in this context … that the NIIA raid needs to be viewed. If we are to address the </p>
<p>Iraqi end&#8209;state, our focus needs to be less on the 90 percent violence against us, </p>
<p>more on the 10 percent reported inter&#8209;Shia/Iraqi violence which threatens stability </p>
<p>when we are gone. Tackling death squad leaders … who pose the major threat </p>

<p>have for our future operations and indeed rationale. Firstly, the ‘Untouchable’ status </p>
<p>of ISOF is already being attacked by the sectional interest within the GOI that (quite </p>
<p>rightly) feel threatened by such a body. The fear is that their freedom of movement </p>
<p>and action is curtailed, their operations politically constrained; this would be most </p>
<p>damaging to ISOF itself and PM Maliki’s ability to operate to the national interest. </p>
<p>Secondly, the danger is that political constraints are so tightly drawn that MND(SE) </p>
<p>cannot operate against the 10 percent threat to the Iraqi end state. If we ever </p>
<p>reached the stage when MND(SE) were restricted to operations in pursuit of our own </p>
<p>force protection, we would need seriously to question our rationale for being here.”</p>
<p><b>1369. </b> Maj Gen Shaw said in his evidence to the Inquiry that “all kinds of mistreatment </p>
<p>of prisoners” were found during the raid, including the rape of a woman in front of her </p>
<p>two children.</p>
<p>1254</p>
<p> However, the mistreatment was not the political headline, “the political </p>
<p>headline was that we had broached Iraqi sovereignty”. Maj Gen Shaw concluded:</p>
<p>“So yes, that was a mistake, it was an unfortunate raid, we learned lessons from it, </p>
<p>we played even more gingerly with Shia political sensitivities thereafter.”</p>
<p><b>1370. </b> On 20 March, ACM Stirrup told Mr Blair that “Petraeus had been helpful in </p>
<p>handling the fallout from the raid on the NIIA headquarters, and that this was in any case </p>
<p>having only a limited effect on operations in Basra itself.”</p>
<p>1255</p>
<p><b>1371. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reported on 21 March: “The ripples of the raid on the NIIA are </p>
<p>seemingly spreading the further we get from the operation itself.”</p>
<p>1256</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1372. </b> The IMOD had issued a letter stating that joint operations between the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army in Basra and the MNF should cease temporarily. Although that had since been </p>
<p>rescinded, Maj Gen Shaw commented that “this makes moving Basra forward towards </p>
<p>PIC more difficult”.</p>
<p><b>1373. </b> On the same day, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary updated Mr Blair on the continued </p>
<p>fallout from the raid.</p>
<p>1257</p>
<p> The MNF&#8209;I investigation into the NIIA raid had concluded that the </p>
<p>operation was conducted in good faith and in support of Iraqi law. But there had been no </p>
<p>notification to either the Iraqi Government or Gen Petraeus because the operation had </p>
<p>been deemed time sensitive. The raid was described as “aggressive but professional” </p>
<p>and it was miscommunication that had led to the prisoners escaping.</p>

<p>ASSESSMENTS OF IRAQI SECURITY FORCE READINESS FOR PROVINCIAL </p>
<p>IRAQI CONTROL</p>
<p><b>1375. </b> In March and April, British forces withdrew from a number of bases in Basra City, </p>
<p>handing them over to 10th Division:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Old State Building on 20 March;</p>
<p>1259</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Shatt al&#8209;Arab Hotel on 8 April; and</p>
<p>1260</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Shaibah Logistics Base on 24 April.</p>
<p>1261</p>
<p><b>1376. </b> A JIC Assessment on 25 April considered the prospects for transition in the </p>
<p>South.</p>
<p>1262</p>
<p> It assessed:</p>
<p>“Increased security efforts in Basra between September 2006 and March 2007 </p>
<p>(Operation SINBAD) had some local effect in disrupting militia activity and improving </p>
<p>public confidence … Sectarian and other murders have fallen from some 100 a </p>
<p>month in mid&#8209;2006 to 30 in March 2007 … Other forms of violence, criminality, and </p>
<p>intimidation – much of which we judge goes unreported – remain widespread. </p>
<p>“MND(SE) assess that ISF in Basra now meet the minimum criteria for transitional </p>
<p>readiness. Slow improvement in the army continues: 1 Brigade in Basra took </p>
<p>the lead in the latter stages of Operation SINBAD and performed well, within the </p>
<p>limitations of their capability. Much more serious problems persist in the local police </p>
<p>[…] 61 arrest warrants against SCU officers remain outstanding, despite coalition </p>
<p>pressure. A weight of reporting shows that police effectiveness in Basra is still </p>
<p>severely compromised by corruption, poor leadership and the entrenched influence </p>
<p>of Shia militias. Some policemen are actively assisting JAM attacks on MNF. </p>
<p>“We judge that as the scale of MNF presence reduces, violence between rival Shia </p>
<p>political parties, backed by their militias, is likely to intensify. Most see PIC as an </p>
<p>opportunity to extend their own power base in political and security structures, and </p>
<p>increase control over economic resources … </p>
<p>“The nature and scale of any conflict will be determined partly by events in Baghdad </p>
<p>and Najaf, particularly the ability of the United Iraqi Alliance to stick together and </p>
<p>assert authority over its provincial supporters … In the absence of an effective </p>
<p>political brake on serious intra&#8209;Shia fighting, we judge that the ISF would not be </p>
<p>able to cope; the police would probably fragment and the army would try to avoid </p>
<p>direct confrontation, while seeking to contain the situation.” </p>

<p><b>1377. </b> At Cabinet on 3 May, Mr Browne stated:</p>
<p>“In Basra and the South&#8209;East, there were encouraging signs of progress. The Iraqi </p>
<p>Army division … was becoming, by any measure, very effective. Its performance </p>
<p>and training had impressed the Americans when it was operating in Baghdad … </p>
<p>In Basra we had now handed over to the Iraqis two bases in the City and one </p>
<p>outside without incident, a significant contrast with the disorder that had taken </p>
<p>place over earlier base handovers … The Iraqi security infrastructure did not work </p>
<p>well and its leadership, including the Provincial Chief of Police and Emergency </p>
<p>Security Committee, was ineffective and incapable of providing the direction needed </p>
<p>by those in the police forces capable of working effectively (estimated as some </p>
<p>80 percent) …”</p>
<p>1263</p>
<p><b>1378. </b> On 2 May, Sir Nigel Sheinwald met ACM Stirrup to discuss whether there was </p>
<p>“continuing military utility” in the UK’s mission in Iraq.</p>
<p>1264</p>
<p> ACM Stirrup said that he saw </p>
<p>that resting on the continuing need to train the Iraqi 10th Division, anti&#8209;JAM operations </p>
<p>and a capacity to re&#8209;intervene. Sir Nigel reported the meeting to Mr Blair and highlighted </p>
<p>that ACM Stirrup had not mentioned the IPS, making the observation: “I think the MOD </p>
<p>now regard them as a busted flush.”</p>
<p><b>1379. </b> On 25 May, a planned ISOF operation in Basra resulted in the death of the Basra </p>
<p>JAM leader Mr Wissam Abu Qadir.</p>
<p>1265</p>
<p> Maj Gen Shaw described the operation as a </p>
<p>success but reported:</p>
<p>“The performance of the ISF was less convincing. Not surprisingly that the IPS </p>
<p>failed to stand and defend the PJCC, but more disappointing that the Iraqi Army was </p>
<p>returned to barracks (following another JAM capture and humiliating release of two </p>
<p>IA vehicles and crew) whilst JAM was on the streets. The order to remain in barracks </p>
<p>was given by Gen Ali Hamadi (Chair of the Emergency Security Committee). His </p>
<p>reasons are not clear, although Gen Habib [the new commander of 10th Division] </p>
<p>claims that it was a direct order from PM Maliki. It may well be true that last Friday </p>
<p>night was not the right time for 10th Division to stand and fight JAM toe to toe and </p>
<p>that the call was a good one. It may equally be true that Gen Ali ordered them back </p>
<p>into barracks as a face saving measure, fearing that 1 Bde (who are Basrawis) </p>
<p>would refuse to soldier, or that JAM had pressurised him into withdrawing them, to </p>
<p>give them a clear shot at us. Gen Habib is, however, acutely aware of the issues </p>
<p>within his own Division and the need to address them. He needs to be given the </p>
<p>opportunity to solve the problems … in an Iraqi way … But as hinted at above, this </p>
<p>‘Iraqi way’ may prove in time to be a ‘non&#8209;aggression’ pact between the IA and JAM.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>376</p>
<p><b>1380. </b> On 13 June, Maj Gen Shaw concluded his weekly report to Lt Gen Houghton:</p>
<p>“The thought I leave my staff to ponder is the credibility of our recommendation </p>
<p>at month end if this remains, ‘Basra ready for transition to PIC in Aug/Sep’. The </p>
<p>pragmatic UK PIC judgements have always been based in large part on judgements </p>
<p>about ‘Iraqi good enough’ in agreement with Iraqi judgements on risk. The recent </p>
<p>focus of GoI interest in Basra security has seemingly reversed what was hitherto </p>
<p>Iraqi enthusiasm for PIC. PM Maliki is concerned about early PIC, the Governor is </p>
<p>against it, as is MG Habib: the IPS are recognised as incapable hence the future </p>
<p>of Basra’s security is being placed in a new … army division (as yet unformed and </p>
<p>unprogrammed); and a new security supremo is promised but as yet unappointed </p>
<p>(although rumours abound). Lack of Iraqi enthusiasm for PIC, and the lengthy period </p>
<p>required to enact the Iraqi solutions, play to State’s concerns about the PIC process </p>
<p>and will make my and LTG Odierno’s [Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, US </p>
<p>Commander Multi&#8209;National Corp &#8209; Iraq] desire for Basra PIC harder to justify.”</p>
<p>1266</p>
<p><b>1381. </b> On 27 June, the JIC reiterated their judgement on the likelihood of violence after </p>
<p>PIC and the ability of the Basra ISF to cope:</p>
<p>“The desire for national Shia unity and the ability of local parties to broker deals </p>
<p>may restrain but will not prevent political violence in the South. In the likely event </p>
<p>of serious intra&#8209;Shia fighting the police would probably take sides according to </p>
<p>their particular tribal and militia affiliations and the army would try to remain on </p>
<p>the sidelines.”</p>

<p><b>Iraqi appointments</b></p>
<p>Three key security personnel in Basra were replaced between March and June 2007:</p>

<p>replacing Maj Gen Latif.</p>
<p>1268</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>General Mohan became the head of newly established Basra Provincial Operational </p>

<p>TRANSITION IN BASRA</p>
<p><b>1382. </b> In July 2007, the UK presence at the PJCC comprised 100 military personnel and </p>
<p>seven police advisers.</p>
<p>1270</p>
<p><b>1383. </b> On 7 June, Maj Gen Shaw reported:</p>
<p>“The increased attacks on the PJCC have exposed a known vulnerability, and </p>
<p>disproved the hope that co&#8209;location with IPS would provide some protection …  </p>
<p>[W]e are reinforcing its sustainment whilst we are there, and reviewing its viability </p>
<p>in the longer term, particularly when Basra Palace is vacated.”</p>
<p>1271</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1384. </b> The minutes of the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 12 June recorded that a DOP </p>
<p>paper on the timing of leaving Basra Palace was being delayed until 12 July to allow </p>
<p>time for further advice on whether UK personnel could remain in the PJCC after it was </p>
<p>vacated.</p>
<p>1272</p>
<p> The MOD assessment was that the advantages of remaining outweighed </p>
<p>the disadvantages.</p>
<p><b>1385. </b> On 13 June, Maj Gen Shaw reported that MND(SE) was keeping the PJCC issue </p>
<p>under constant review: “The situation is fluid and I would wish to retain the freedom of </p>
<p>decision for as long as possible. My intent remains to retain it for as long as practicable, </p>
<p>and we are well aware of the message sent if/when we leave it.”</p>
<p>1273</p>
<p><b>1386. </b> On 20 June, the PJCC was attacked by indirect fire (IDF), fatally wounding </p>
<p>Major Paul Harding.</p>
<p>1274</p>
<p> The junior official briefing Mr Browne on the incident wrote </p>
<p>that the PJCC had been subject to a number of attacks over the last month, including </p>
<p>from Rocket Propelled Grenades and IDF. Although a number of personnel had been </p>
<p>wounded in those attacks, this was the first UK fatality.</p>
<p><b>1387. </b> The official wrote that, because of the attacks, the PJCC was subject to regular </p>
<p>security reviews. A mortar locating radar had recently been installed as a result. The </p>
<p>medical team in place (one Emergency Trauma Nurse and three combat medical </p>
<p>technicians) was more than would ordinarily be allocated to a deployment of the PJCC’s </p>
<p>size, but had been deemed necessary because of the increased threat to the site.</p>
<p><b>1388. </b> AM Stirrup visited Iraq from 1 to 3 July.</p>
<p>1275</p>
<p> His visit report stated that he had </p>
<p>been advised by Maj Gen Shaw that there was “little military advantage” in retaining a </p>
<p>presence at either the PJCC or Basra Palace, other than for “retaining a base for strike </p>
<p>operations and some situational awareness”. Maj Gen Shaw advocated relocating to </p>
<p>Basra Air Station at the “earliest practicable point”. Maj Gen Shaw was “confident” that </p>
<p>the conditions set for PIC had been met.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>378</p>
<p><b>1389. </b> The minutes from the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 10 July stated that Lt Gen Odierno </p>
<p>had disagreed with Maj Gen Shaw’s assessment that Basra was ready for PIC.</p>
<p>1276</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lt Gen Odierno had said that the new ISF structures should be allowed time to “bed&#8209;in”, </p>
<p>with the possibility of PIC in October 2007. </p>
<p><b>1390. </b> On 13 July, Maj Gen Shaw reported that Maj Gen Jalil was taking a “robust </p>
<p>stance” towards the IPS in Basra, docking pay and sacking police officers.</p>
<p>1277</p>
<p> He had </p>
<p>also begun his “purge” of militia elements within the IPS – removing vehicles and ending </p>
<p>their employment. In response, he had been subject to an assassination attempt when </p>
<p>he left the PJCC.</p>
<p><b>1391. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Shaw recalled that Maj Gen Jalil had come </p>
<p>to “the very strong conclusion – very early” that “the issue here is not one of training, </p>
<p>nor of equipment, it is one of loyalty”, and that that was a statement that resonated very </p>
<p>strongly with previously held views.</p>
<p>1278</p>
<p> Maj Gen Shaw said:</p>
<p>“… why is it that police forces in Muthanna and Dhi Qar … operate so differently to </p>
<p>the police in Basra when they both had the same equipment and the same training? </p>
<p>The only difference was loyalty. It wasn’t a question of whether they were members </p>
<p>of militias or not, because … the police forces in Dhi Qar and Muthanna were </p>
<p>actually Badr dominated, but … there was unity of command.</p>
<p>“… if you, as a militia, decided to work with the Government of Iraq, then that </p>
<p>was fine.”</p>
<p><b>1392. </b> Maj Gen Shaw said that Maj Gen Jalil recognised that the problem with the </p>
<p>Basra police force was that it “reflected all the divisions within the Basra society”. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw added that “Unfortunately, the same was true of the army as well and </p>
<p>that was the problem with 10 Division.”</p>
<p><b>1393. </b> Gen Mohan shared Maj Gen Shaw’s analysis “that the problem was loyalty”. MNF </p>
<p>received political advice from Gen Mohan “as to what he thought the impact of military </p>
<p>strikes would be and whether they would be good or bad”. That process generated </p>
<p>optimism “with a very positive way forward … for a political resolution of the violence </p>
<p>problem”.</p>
<p><b>1394. </b> On 15 July, Lt Gen Lamb reported that Gen Mohan and Maj Gen Jalil had given </p>
<p>a “very stark” assessment of the situation in Basra to the Ministerial Committee for </p>
<p>National Security (MCNS).</p>
<p>1279</p>
<p> He stated that Gen Mohan had “an ‘outline’ plan” to rectify </p>
<p>“what he described as a city without law and order”. He was already reviewing his initial </p>

<p><b>A new Iraqi Army division for Basra</b></p>
<p>On 12 June 2007, Maj Gen Wall briefed the Chiefs of Staff that the Iraqi Minister of </p>
<p>Defence had recently called for MND(SE) to have two army divisions; one for Basra </p>
<p>City and one for the rest of the South&#8209;East.</p>
<p>1280</p>
<p> Maj Gen Wall reported that there was no </p>
<p>indication of how this new division would be raised, funded or equipped. </p>
<p>At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 26 June, Lt Gen Houghton reported that “greater clarity” </p>
<p>had been achieved.</p>
<p>1281</p>
<p> The 10th Division would be given an additional brigade; a new </p>
<p>14th Division which would assume responsibility for the rest of the South&#8209;East, with nine </p>
<p>brigades across Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan provinces. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Houghton stated that work would continue on training 1,000 personnel, primarily </p>
<p>pre&#8209;2003 Iraqi Army personnel, to form the Presidential Guard Force who would take </p>
<p>control of Basra Palace. The force was due to be ready by 14 August.</p>
<p>On 17 July, Maj Gen Wall briefed the Chiefs of Staff that a Ministerial Order had been </p>
<p>issued for the creation of 14th Division, which would now have responsibility for Basra.</p>
<p>1282</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 10th Division would “reposture” with its headquarters in either al&#8209;Amara or Nasiriyah. </p>

<p>Multi&#8209;National Corps&#8209;Iraq, reported on a meeting of the Crisis Action Cell earlier that </p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>1283</p>
<p> He wrote that Gen Mohan’s description of Basra at the meeting was that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The police were infiltrated by militia and unreliable.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The 1st Brigade of 10th Division were “defeated”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The 5th Brigade was still in formation and lacking key capabilities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISF was set against a complex political environment with 24 militias all </p>
<p>armed and competing for power.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>Paper FCO and MOD, 12 July 2007, ‘Iraq: Transition in Basra’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>was that the MNF presence was a distorting factor which caused the ISF to be seen as </p>
<p>collaborators rather than nationalists.</p>
<p><b>1397. </b> The officials suggested withdrawing the UK’s presence from the PJCC at the </p>
<p>same time as Basra Palace, given the threat to UK personnel. The paper stated:</p>
<p>“When we leave the PJCC, our Security Sector Reform work there will cease … </p>
<p>But in our judgement, these downsides are outweighed by the risks in remaining at </p>
<p>the site. And the PJCC is no longer as crucial a centre for the Iraqi Security Forces, </p>
<p>since Mohan moved the Basra Operations Centre to the Shatt Al&#8209;Arab Hotel. We </p>
<p>therefore recommend that we plan to remove all UK personnel from the site in </p>
<p>parallel with leaving Basra Palace.”</p>
<p><b>1398. </b> Recalling the looting that occurred when the UK vacated Camp Abu Naji in </p>
<p>Maysan, the paper stated that it was “critical” that the UK did not leave until a “credible </p>
<p>Iraqi Guard Force” was in place. That would be ready by the end of August. </p>
<p><b>1399. </b> The paper described US concerns about transition:</p>
<p>“They [the US] are intensely nervous about transition in Basra. They believe the </p>
<p>local Iraqi Security Forces are not robust enough to handle security without our </p>
<p>direct support.”</p>
<p><b>1400. </b> On the future for Basra, the paper stated that there might be “an initial period in </p>
<p>which the Iraqi Security Forces faced challenges to their authority from militia groups” </p>
<p>and that “There will be weaknesses at the leadership level in the Iraqi Security Forces.”</p>
<p><b>1401. </b> In an annex to the paper, there was an assessment of Basra province against </p>
<p>the conditions for PIC, one of which was “the Iraqi Security Forces’ capacity to maintain </p>
<p>order and conduct counter insurgency operations”. The paper reiterated concerns about </p>
<p>the “vulnerability [of 10th Division] to political pressure when operating in Basra” and </p>
<p>stated that it was likely that that would continue leading to them refusing to confront JAM </p>
<p>independently. The Basra IPS was “on target” to meet the PIC criteria with 93 percent </p>
<p>of stations assessed at TRA level 2 or higher. It then reiterated concerns about public </p>
<p>confidence, militia infiltration and the requirement for institutional reform.</p>
<p><b>1402. </b> Another annex addressed future UK ambitions in Basra. The military plan was </p>
<p>that 950 troops would be assigned to SSR and “rear area tasks such as border patrols”. </p>
<p>The military would also assist in maintaining an acceptable security environment to </p>
<p>enable SSR activities. </p>
<p><b>1403. </b> On 6 August, the British Embassy Baghdad reported on the MCNS meeting held </p>
<p>the previous day.</p>
<p>1285</p>
<p> Mr Qadar, the Minister of Defence, was impressed with the “positive </p>

<p>and he was trying to identify further reinforcements for 10th Division. Mr Boulani, the </p>
<p>Minister of Interior, was looking to reinforce Basra’s police force with better leaders, </p>
<p>possibly with commanders outside the province.</p>
<p><b>1404. </b> On 30 August, Major General Graham Binns, GOC MND(SE) from August 2007 </p>
<p>until February 2008, reported that UK forces had handed over the PJCC four days </p>
<p>previously, ahead of schedule and without incident.</p>
<p>1286</p>
<p><b>1405. </b> The same day, at the Iraq Strategy Group meeting, Lieutenant General </p>
<p>Peter Wall, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments) from August 2007, </p>
<p>reported that there had been some “limited militia infiltration and looting of the site” </p>
<p>following the handover “with the possible collusion or acquiescence of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Police Service”.</p>
<p>1287</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1406. </b> In a letter from Mr Browne to Mr Gordon Brown (who had become Prime Minister </p>
<p>on 27 June) on 31 August, the looting was described as “unauthorised movement of </p>
<p>equipment”.</p>
<p>1288</p>
<p> In response, Gen Mohan deployed his entire reserve battalion to the site. </p>
<p><b>1407. </b> On 3 September, UK forces withdrew from Basra Palace and relocated at Basra </p>
<p>Air Station (as described in Section 9.6).</p>
<p>1289</p>
<p> As well as the Presidential Guard Force, </p>
<p>elements from the 10th Division were stationed in Basra Palace. </p>
<p><b>1408. </b> Maj Gen Binns described the withdrawal in his evidence to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we first had to fold in from the … PJCC, the Permanent Joint Co&#8209;ordination </p>
<p>Centre. So we had to remove our presence there and come into the Palace. We </p>
<p>then had to recruit, train, equip and deploy an Iraqi security force which became </p>
<p>known as the Palace Protection Force, to take over the Palace.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Then we had to conduct a relief in place</p>
<p>1290</p>
<p> with the Iraqi Palace Protection Force, </p>
<p>and then, the final act in all of that, was to remove ourselves in early September.</p>
<p>“… I reflect that it went remarkably well, considering all of the complexities.”</p>
<p>1291</p>
<p><b>1409. </b> As a result of withdrawing UK police from the Warren site, support to the PJCC </p>
<p>and the NIIA ceased, as did station visits by Police Transition Teams.</p>

<p><b>1411. </b> On 20 September, Maj Gen Binns stated:</p>
<p>“Reporting from multiple sources indicates that the security situation is improving; </p>
<p>IPS and IA units are conducting joint operations in the city … and LOs [liaison </p>
<p>officers] from the BOC [Basra Operations Command] are now working in the </p>

<p>that militias are using the ceasefire period to reorganise and resupply. Of course </p>
<p>criminality and gangsterism remain endemic.”</p>

<p>Security Forces … we are now in a position where there are nearly 30,000 Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces [in the South]. So what we propose to do over these next few </p>
<p>months is to … maintain a facility for re&#8209;intervention if necessary, but at the same </p>
<p>time we play a greater role in training future security forces. I believe that within </p>
<p>the next two months we can move to Provincial Iraqi Control, and that is the Iraqis </p>
<p>taking responsibility for their own security in the whole of Basra. I believe that the </p>

<p>“re&#8209;organising the ‘local policing’ resources to deliver effective crime prevention, </p>
<p>investigation and community policing”.</p>
<p><b>1415. </b> ACC Colbourne wrote that developing the Emergency Battalions would be “the </p>
<p>most demanding aspect of this support”. He had agreed with Maj Gen Jalil that his team </p>
<p>would complete the current training of his officers at Shaibah in addition to generating </p>
<p>an Iraqi training team. He planned for the six existing ArmorGroup IPAs to put that team </p>
<p>in place, capable of delivering the Emergency Battalion syllabus, by early December. </p>
<p>It had been agreed that all other Basra&#8209;based ArmorGroup contractors would end their </p>
<p>missions by the end of November. ACC Colbourne stated that “the sheer scale of the </p>
<p>training” required a “bigger and more permanent” solution.</p>
<p><b>1416. </b> ACC Colbourne wrote that the Emergency Battalions would be “instrumental” in </p>
<p>enabling Maj Gen Jalil to “engage the militias” and “hold ground”. Once achieved, he </p>
<p>wrote that there would “be an urgent need to reposition the ‘miltaristic’ policing style </p>
<p>which will be dominant in Basra, to a more community focused local policing approach”. </p>
<p><b>1417. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee had published a report on </p>
<p>3 December 2007, following a visit to Iraq from 8 to 11 July.</p>
<p>1298</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1418. </b> Reporting on the Committee’s visit to Basra, Mr Asquith said that in response to </p>
<p>being asked about the current security situation in the city and the likely consequences </p>
<p>of a UK withdrawal within 12 months:</p>
<p>“The Basrawis were clear: services and reconstruction were improving but the </p>
<p>main problem was that the ISF were under&#8209;funded, unqualified and security was </p>
<p>deteriorating. The British Government had promised a lot when it liberated Iraq, </p>
<p>but had not delivered. Militias were more of a concern than criminal gangs. The </p>
<p>provincial authorities were not able to confront the militias because the security </p>
<p>forces owed their loyalty to political parties rather than the State … Pulling no </p>
<p>punches, they said a British withdrawal would ‘be followed by chaos sweeping </p>
<p>the province like a hurricane’.”</p>
<p>1299</p>
<p><b>1419. </b> The Committee’s report concluded: </p>
<p>“Despite its increasing capability, the Iraqi Army in South Eastern Iraq still requires </p>
<p>the support of UK Forces, particularly in logistics and intelligence …</p>
<p>“… The Police would seem to have a long way to go in becoming truly effective and </p>
<p>in gaining the trust of the population. Given the scale of the problems which still </p>
<p>need to be tackled, there would seem to be a need for an ongoing commitment by </p>
<p>the UK to training and mentoring the Iraqi Police.”</p>

<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the concept was described as M2T, monitoring, mentoring and training. I would </p>
<p>say it was a big T. It was a medium&#8209;sized M, monitoring, but we didn’t do a lot </p>
<p>of mentoring …</p>
<p>“So if I start with the T, training, I think we had a very successful training centre that </p>
<p>we had built at Shaibah Log Base. We were able to take people from initial training, </p>
<p>we were able to supervise Iraqis training themselves. We were able to equip them, </p>
<p>to deploy them, to sustain them … we didn’t then mentor them when they were </p>
<p>deployed on operation, and that was the significant difference between the way </p>
<p>that we approached support and the way that the Americans approached support </p>
<p>in Basra.”</p>

<p> He described the visit, </p>
<p>in a letter to Mr Brown, as “intense but stimulating and productive”, observing that it had </p>
<p>been “markedly the most encouraging of my seven visits to Basra”. He commented:</p>
<p>“The primary deficiency in the security apparatus remains the judicial sector. I am </p>
<p>sceptical about our ability to deliver an effective Iraqi Police Service when there is </p>
<p>no functioning framework of enforceable law within which they can operate. This </p>
<p>needs our urgent attention. It does not, in my view, need to mean the deployment </p>
<p>of significant additional resources to Iraq; I am attracted by the idea of electronic </p>
<p>mentoring of the Iraqi judiciary by international counterparts.”</p>

<p> He described the need for two </p>

<p>by the advice of our military commanders – we plan to move to a second stage of </p>

<p><b>1427. </b> ACM Stirrup met the Commanding Officer of the Monitoring, Mentoring and </p>
<p>Training Battlegroup who assured him that 14th Division were on track to be ready by </p>
<p>June 2008. The Chief of Police Training Adviser told him that Maj Gen Jalil was “proving </p>
<p>very dynamic, robust and effective, particularly in fighting the MOI’s reluctance to root </p>
<p>out militia influences” but that only 48 percent of Basra police had been trained. </p>

<p>Basra for PIC in December.</p>
<p>1307</p>
<p> He had been encouraged by the positive impact that </p>
<p>Gen Mohan and Maj Gen Jalil were having but remained concerned by reports of militia </p>
<p>influence within the Basra ISF. Maj Gen Binns commented: “Not a ringing endorsement, </p>
<p>but a positive step and an endorsement we’ve been trying to achieve since April </p>
<p>this year.”</p>
<p><b>1429. </b> Basra transitioned to PIC on 16 December 2007 (described in Section 9.6).</p>
<p><b>1430. </b> When asked about the capability of the ISF in December 2007 during his </p>
<p>evidence to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Binns said:</p>
<p>“… they had weaknesses … they were well trained, as individuals, but their </p>
<p>leadership was not experienced, they were capable of conducting tactical, low&#8209;level </p>
<p>operations, but their ability to conduct manoeuvre, to sustain themselves logistically, </p>
<p>was a challenge to them.</p>
<p>“But I thought they wouldn’t get better until they were given responsibility … it was a </p>
<p>bit like taking the stabilisers off a child’s bike. They were going to wobble for a while </p>
<p>and I was there to make sure they didn’t fall over.”</p>
<p>1308</p>
<p><b>1431. </b> On the police’s capability at that time, Maj Gen Binns said:</p>
<p>“The police were a mixed bag. At their worst, they were trouble. They had been </p>
<p>infiltrated and they were a constraint on progress.</p>
<p>“At their best, and there were some very good police units … they were good, they </p>
<p>were effective. The national police units, who came from Baghdad, were highly </p>
<p>effective and something that the Iraqis were particularly proud of.”</p>
<p><b>1432. </b> On 20 December, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“Prospects in Basra will depend on ISF willingness and ability to take on Shia militias </p>
<p>or reach and maintain an accommodation with them and on the ability of local </p>

<p><b>1433. </b> On the 14th Division, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“The replacement of an Iraqi Army brigade in Basra with the new 14th Army Division </p>
<p>(still 50 percent undermanned) and the deployment of an NP [National Police] </p>
<p>battalion and a mechanised infantry unit have raised the ISF profile in Basra from </p>
<p>30,000 in June to 33,500 in December. MNF expect ISF to reach a full strength </p>
<p>of 36,500 in June 2008. Largely manned from outside Basra, these forces are </p>
<p>probably less influenced by local tribal and political ties or militia infiltration than </p>
<p>those recruited locally. The vast majority of JAM continues to observe a cease&#8209;fire </p>
<p>with MNF in Basra and have not challenged ISF for local control – although […] they </p>
<p>think they could successfully do so.”</p>
<p><b>1434. </b> On 8 January 2008, AM Peach told the Chiefs of Staff that Gen Mohan had </p>
<p>created a “security equilibrium” in Basra, using a “carrot and stick” approach, but that </p>
<p>recent concessions and reassurances by him to JAM “demonstrated the precarious </p>
<p>nature of the balance of power in Basra”.</p>
<p>1310</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1435. </b> Gen Mohan visited the UK in January.</p>
<p>1311</p>
<p> He gave an “upbeat” description of </p>
<p>security, stating that it was up to the British if they wanted to leave but that he needed to </p>
<p>be left with “real military capability” to outface JAM and Iranian&#8209;backed militias. He asked </p>
<p>for UK assistance in building intelligence capabilities.</p>
<p><b>1436. </b> IDF attacks on UK forces at Basra Air Station began to rise again in 2008 (see </p>
<p>Section 9.6). On 21 February, Major General Barney White&#8209;Spunner, who had just </p>
<p>succeeded Maj Gen Binns as GOC MND(SE), commented:</p>
<p>“General Mohan is fully aware (as are we) that his ability to further strengthen </p>
<p>his control of Basra City is limited as the ISF cannot match JAM in their urban </p>
<p>heartlands, though he is deploying 14th Division into the city as soon as he can. </p>
<p>Our efforts to develop the ISF capability to interdict smuggling of lethal aid as well </p>
<p>as strenuous efforts to develop their urban warfare skills may enable Mohan to have </p>
<p>the desired effect in the future, but for now there is not very much he can do.”</p>
<p>1312</p>
<p><b>1437. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner recalled that the first </p>
<p>“increasingly obvious” point on his arrival was that:</p>
<p>“… we needed to redirect our training of the ISF and we needed to … dedicate more </p>
<p>of a mission to … develop 14 Division.”</p>
<p>1313</p>
<p><b>1438. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner said that Gen Mohan had asked for “offensive support”:</p>
<p>“By this we mean those weapons systems … which support infantry rather than </p>
<p>being infantry themselves, particularly the ability to target air and helicopters, </p>
<p>intelligence and surveillance assistance, assistance with command and control </p>
<p>and logistics.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>1439. </b> On 23 February, Mr Prentice discussed the security situation in Basra with </p>
<p>Dr Rubaie, who confirmed that an order replacing Gen Mohan had been signed by Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki based on a report that a “non&#8209;interference pact” had been signed with </p>
<p>JAM.</p>
<p>1314</p>
<p> Mr Prentice commented that the UK had some understanding of the balance </p>
<p>that Gen Mohan and Maj Gen Jalil had to strike in handling the militias and that “It was </p>
<p>probably wise not to seek a confrontation with JAM, while the army and police were still </p>
<p>building their strength.” Dr Rubaie observed that there was a difference between calming </p>
<p>the situation and fearing to confront it.</p>
<p><b>1440. </b> On 27 February, the JIC assessed security prospects in the South:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi security forces (ISF) ability and willingness to maintain security in the </p>
<p>South remains patchy and dependent on MNF training, logistic and specialist air </p>
<p>support. Radical improvements in police effectiveness are unlikely. The army will </p>
<p>remain at the forefront in providing security, relying on assistance from units outside </p>
<p>the South to cope with serious and sustained violence there. The Iraqis would only </p>
<p>call for MNF troop re&#8209;intervention as a last resort.</p>
<p>“Violent criminality, murders, kidnappings, score&#8209;settling and intimidation will remain </p>
<p>part of life in southern Iraq. Pressure from national Shia political and religious </p>
<p>leaders, reinforced by some local political leaders and security officials, may limit </p>
<p>the scope of unrest. But local ISF action, accommodations between the ISF and </p>
<p>elements of JAM, and the perception of MNF willingness to intervene, will also </p>
<p>remain crucial tools for managing instability.”</p>
<p>1315</p>
<p><b>1441. </b> The JIC reported that, although reliable data for attacks against non&#8209;MNF targets </p>
<p>was lacking, in Basra City alone there had been about 80 murders and 40 kidnappings. </p>
<p>Accounts in the media suggested that Shia militia were increasingly punishing and </p>
<p>sometimes killing women for “contravening strict interpretations of Islamic mores”. </p>
<p>Around 10 women were reportedly murdered each month in Basra City. </p>
<p><b>1442. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Browne had breakfast with the Chiefs of Staff on 6 March.</p>
<p>1316</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Chiefs told them that “there was quality in the ISF but it was not broadening as </p>
<p>rapidly as hoped, so training and mentoring of 14Div remained a vital job”.</p>
<p><b>Charge of the Knights</b></p>
<p><b>1443. </b> In late March, Prime Minister Maliki launched a security operation in Basra, </p>
<p>code&#8209;named <i>Sawlat al&#8209;Fursan </i>(Arabic for “Charge of the Knights”). The operation had </p>
<p>wide&#8209;ranging effects on the UK’s position and standing in Iraq and is described in detail </p>

<p>12.1  |  Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>1444. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner described the lack of a </p>
<p>strategy at the start of the Charge of the Knights:</p>
<p>“To start with, there wasn’t one, because, of course, the detailed planning hadn’t </p>
<p>been done. That’s why the first few days were very anxious … – particularly for </p>
<p>General Mohan – because there was really no plan for his existing troops – 14 Div, </p>
<p>and the police … to work to.”</p>
<p>1317</p>
<p><b>1445. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner described how Gen Mohan was given a planning team </p>
<p>and a strategy was developed:</p>
<p>“… General Mohan and I drew up this plan which saw an Iraqi lead with us in </p>
<p>support rather than the other way on, as in SINBAD … the overall plan, which was </p>
<p>actually very similar to SINBAD in concept, it was a clearance of Basra and the </p>
<p>whole province by phases …”</p>
<p>1318</p>
<p><b>1446. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“One of those things we did in the first days of Charge of the Knights was bring </p>
<p>forward what we had wanted to do, what we had realised we had to do in February, </p>
<p>which was to put teams in with the MiTTs … with the Iraqi formations to whom we </p>
<p>were responsible …”</p>
<p>1319</p>
<p><b>1447. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner explained how that was a “major change” as the UK </p>
<p>approach to MiTTs was brought closer to the US approach:</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we looked at what they [the US] were doing and certainly it was very </p>
<p>influential. Our construct was slightly different … the point was that we reversed </p>
<p>what had been British policy up until then, which wasn’t to do this, and had very </p>
<p>strong and immediate support – I put a submission in to the Ministry of Defence I </p>
<p>think on 1 April and had authority the next day to do this. So I thought that showed </p>
<p>great sort of flexibility and ability to adapt.”</p>
<p>1320</p>
<p><b>1448. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner later added:</p>
<p>“It became rapidly clear to us that the nature of support that the Iraqi Security Forces </p>
<p>wanted had changed with Charge of the Knights … </p>
<p>“Charge of the Knights meant we had to adjust very rapidly and untidily, but we </p>
<p>did it …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>1449. </b> On 29 March, the Director of Joint Commitments reported to Mr Browne’s </p>
<p>Assistant Private Secretary that he considered “little tangible success has been achieved </p>
<p>by either side, and sustained conflict looks set to continue”.</p>
<p>1322</p>
<p><b>1450. </b> An eGram on the same day stated that the Iraqi media were reporting that over </p>
<p>a hundred police officers had been sacked in Basra, apparently for losing their weapons </p>
<p>and/or abandoning their posts during the recent clashes.</p>
<p>1323</p>
<p><b>1451. </b> On 31 March, it was reported that questions had been asked at the MCNS </p>
<p>meeting that day about the reports of police desertions in Baghdad and allegations of </p>
<p>poor co&#8209;operation between the police and army.</p>
<p>1324</p>
<p> The representative of the MOI told </p>
<p>the Council that “only 10 percent of the national Police had proven ineffective” and that </p>
<p>more than 400 police had been dismissed in Basra in recent days for “disloyalty”.</p>
<p><b>1452. </b> On 14 April, the CIG assessed ISF performance in MND(SE) during Charge of the </p>
<p>Knights.</p>
<p>1325</p>
<p> It referred back to the JIC’s Assessment on 27 February, reporting that the </p>
<p>JIC had correctly predicted that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISF would rely on MNF support – “… on their own, the ISF underperformed </p>
<p>against JAM in Basra, Maysan and Dhi Qar during recent operations. In Basra </p>
<p>they relied heavily on MNF supplies (i.e. ammunition and rations), air strikes </p>
<p>and eventually MNF mentoring. […] Military reporting suggested little sign of </p>
<p>a detailed operational plan or evidence of precision targeting of JAM Special </p>
<p>Groups or other hard&#8209;line elements until the arrival of MNF training teams from </p>
<p>1 April.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The influence of Shia militias would hinder radical improvement in the </p>
<p>effectiveness of Basra’s police – “Basra’s Chief of Police reportedly believes </p>
<p>that hundreds of local police melted away within the first 24 hours of fighting – </p>
<p>others joined JAM’s ranks. Reporting that several police stations and dozens of </p>
<p>police vehicles were abandoned in the face of militia intimidation supports this. </p>
<p>Many of the National Police units drafted in from Baghdad, with superior arms </p>
<p>and armour, fared much better. The affiliation of many to ISCI [Islamic Supreme </p>
<p>Council in Iraq]/Badr probably strengthened their resolve to try and weaken their </p>
<p>chief rival [JAM].”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The 10th and 14th Divisions of the IA would require assistance from outside </p>
<p>the South to cope with serious and sustained violence – “… even with </p>
<p>reinforcements from Baghdad’s 1st</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Division, military reporting suggests that the </p>
<p>Iraqi Army lost most tactical engagements against JAM and failed to take any </p>
<p>ground prior to JAM’s stand down on 31st</p>
<p> </p>
<p>March. However, neither did they </p>

<p>important ports at Umm Qasr and Khor al&#8209;Zubayr and expelling the militia </p>
<p>ridden Facilities Protection Service has emboldened them. Iraqi Special Forces </p>
<p>were ineffective until their US mentors were re&#8209;inserted. In Dhi Qar’s capital </p>
<p>Nasiriyah, JAM reportedly made some territorial gains over the ISF before their </p>
<p>stand down, while in Maysan, ISF opted not to confront JAM (recognising they </p>
<p>would not be able to defeat them and leaving them in control of Al&#8209;Amara for the </p>
<p>second time in two months).”</p>
<p><b>1453. </b> Assessing the ISF’s future, the CIG stated:</p>
<p>“Despite their underwhelming performance, we assess that JAM’s stand down, </p>
<p>leaving ISF holding the field, has increased the latter’s credibility among most </p>
<p>Basrawis and imbued them with greater confidence. Despite the continued likelihood </p>
<p>that Generals Mohan and Jalil will be moved on, diplomatic reporting suggests that </p>
<p>the MOI may at least continue some of their security reforms: it has already sacked </p>
<p>1,000 militia affiliated members of the police. However, many will almost certainly </p>
<p>re&#8209;surface within the system. Others, unless directed towards viable alternative </p>
<p>employment, may replenish JAM’s ranks.”</p>
<p><b>1454. </b> On 14 May, the JIC stated in an Assessment that, as a result of the Charge of the </p>
<p>Knights, “public confidence in the ISF has grown”.</p>
<p>1326</p>
<p> However, “Strong JAM resistance </p>
<p>in the initial phases of the Charge exposed enduring weaknesses in the largely untested </p>
<p>local ISF: inadequate planning, confused command and control structures, feeble </p>
<p>logistics and split loyalties … Basra’s police were particularly ineffective.”</p>
<p><b>1455. </b> The JIC continued: </p>
<p>“Though the ISF overall are improving, the Iraqi Government has recognised that </p>
<p>radical changes are needed to upgrade Basra’s security forces – particularly the </p>
<p>police. The Ministry of Interior plans to fire 6,000 security personnel for deserting </p>
<p>their positions … implementing [changes] effectively will be tricky: militiamen </p>
<p>dismissed from the army or police often find employment elsewhere in the ISF …”</p>
<p><b>1456. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner reflected on police </p>
<p>performance during the Charge of the Knights, and the different approach taken </p>
<p>afterwards:</p>
<p>“I don’t think the police came out of Charge of the Knights very well, if I’m being </p>
<p>honest … we do need to look at how we trained the police prior to that. I think </p>
<p>we may have erred on the side of training the police in what I would call sort of </p>
<p>UK/Home Counties policing, whereas actually what was probably wanted was </p>
<p>something slightly more robust …</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>392</p>
<p>“What happened during the Charge of the Knights was actually a lot of the police </p>
<p>collapsed effectively and it took a lot of time to rebuild them and we tried to rebuild </p>
<p>them on a different model, on more what I would call … a paramilitary basis, so that </p>
<p>they could fire weapons, defend themselves and restore order as much as they </p>
<p>could take fingerprints and gather evidence.”</p>
<p>1327</p>
<p><b>1457. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner commented on the joint working between the army and </p>
<p>the police:</p>
<p>“It was because the police were felt to be less reliable than the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi </p>
<p>Army has always been to the fore in Iraq … and there was a feeling that the police </p>
<p>would be morally and physically strengthened by having the Iraqi Army posted </p>
<p>alongside them.”</p>
<p>1328</p>
<p><b>1458. </b> When asked whether the police fought against the ISF during the Charge of the </p>
<p>Knights, Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner responded: </p>
<p>“A few, very few. Some units did very well. I certainly wouldn’t want to be overcritical </p>
<p>of the force as a whole … some of his [Maj Gen Jalil’s] units did very well, but a lot </p>
<p>just put their weapons down and melted away. Some were infiltrated by JAM.”</p>
<p>1329</p>
<p><b>1459. </b> On 8 July, an eGram from the British Embassy Office Basra reported that the </p>
<p>operational phase of Charge of the Knights had ended.</p>
<p>1330</p>
<p> “Intelligence&#8209;led strike </p>
<p>operations” continued around Basra, leading to the arrest of the second in command for </p>
<p>the team that attacked the Contingency Operating Base on 8 May and 8 June. The ISF </p>
<p>considered their operation in Maysan a success: the Chairman, two Council members, </p>
<p>and the former Chief of Police were arrested for supporting militia and criminal activities. </p>
<p>They tried to arrest the Governor of Maysan but he had already fled.</p>
<p><b>1460. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Shirreff described how 14th Division was </p>
<p>able to tackle JAM in the South during the Charge of the Knights, unlike the locally </p>
<p>recruited 10th Division:</p>
<p>“There was no way they were prepared to really get stuck in and fight against </p>
<p>the Jaysh Al Mahdi, for understandable reasons, and I think it was only when Iraqi </p>
<p>troops from outside the Shia south came in that you were able to really begin </p>
<p>the process.”</p>

<p><b>1461. </b> Maj Gen Shaw also reflected on the Charge of the Knights in his evidence to the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Charge of the Knights actually was a great success, in terms of the establishment </p>
<p>of … Iraqi self&#8209;rule, because, finally, it was a decisive blow by Maliki declaring some </p>
<p>elements of the Shia polity out of bounds.”</p>
<p>1332</p>
<p><b>Iraqi Navy progress</b></p>
<p>In April 2008, the Iraqi Navy grew and took on additional responsibilities: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Around 500 Iraqi Army personnel were transferred to the Iraqi Marines to form a </p>
<p>second battalion.</p>
<p>1333</p>
<p> One battalion provided defence of the offshore oil platforms </p>
<p>and the second protected the port of Umm Qasr.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Navy took responsibility for the point defence of the Khwar al Amaya </p>
<p>Oil terminal and perimeter security for the port and power station in az&#8209;Zubayr.</p>
<p>By that stage the Navy personnel total had increased to over 1,800.</p>
<p>As the UK had failed to negotiate an MOU covering the continued presence of Royal </p>
<p>Navy trainers, the 80 Royal Navy personnel temporarily departed Iraq along with other UK </p>
<p>forces in July 2009.</p>
<p>1334</p>
<p> A UK&#8209;Iraq Training and Maritime Support Agreement was signed </p>
<p>in November 2009 and the trainers returned. They worked alongside around 50 US Navy, </p>
<p>Marine and Coastguard personnel.</p>
<p>The Royal Navy team remained in Iraq until 22 May 2011 when the agreement expired.</p>
<p>1335</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2011, the UK trained 1,800 Iraqi Navy personnel, providing between </p>
<p>50 and 90 Royal Navy personnel for the task. Dr Liam Fox, the Defence Secretary, stated:</p>
<p>“Royal Navy personnel have used their formidable skills and expertise to bring </p>
<p>about a transformation in Iraq’s naval force. The Iraqi Navy has a key role to play </p>
<p>in protecting Iraq’s territorial waters and the oil infrastructure that is so vital to Iraq’s </p>
<p>economy, and I am proud of the role British forces have played in making it capable </p>
<p>of doing that job.”</p>
<p>The Naval training mission continued until May 2011 when 81 Navy trainers and three UK </p>
<p>personnel in Baghdad withdrew and Op TELIC formally ended.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>“In effect, he has engaged with the local tribes and established a ‘Sons of Iraq’ </p>
<p>programme. The maturity of this programme seems similar to that for his overall </p>
<p>Basra initiative; limited. A combined MNF&#8209;I and MNC&#8209;I team has begun to work </p>
<p>on possible recommendations for implementation, but clearly this must be a GoI </p>
<p>programme and they may not want any coalition support. A sufficiently robust </p>
<p>governance structure will be required to prevent this group turning into another </p>
<p>armed militia and a considered approach is needed to prevent them becoming a </p>
<p>new target set for JAM. Whilst the establishment of such a programme in MND(SE) </p>
<p>is something that the UK has sought to avoid and which we continue to oppose, our </p>
<p>voice carries little weight and there is little that we can and ought to do other than </p>
<p>support the MNC&#8209;I in developing recommendations.”</p>
<p><b>1463. </b> On 14 April, the CIG reported: </p>
<p>“Intelligence shows that despite the Government of Iraq’s previously strong </p>
<p>objections to tribal awakenings in the South, their proven ability to act as force </p>
<p>multipliers for the ISF in Basra and a counter&#8209;balance to JAM is going to be one of </p>
<p>the key products of the recent conflict. Intelligence suggests that 500 have already </p>
<p>been recruited and that Maliki has tasked local tribal leaders to hand pick others. </p>
<p>Diplomatic reports suggest that as many as 25,000 have been asked for. However, </p>
<p>this additional dynamic to Basra’s security landscape is not without risk. Inter&#8209;tribal </p>
<p>conflict may result in places: reporting suggests that JAM already has plans to </p>
<p>eradicate them.”</p>
<p>1338</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1464. </b> On 8 July, an eGram from the British Embassy Office Basra suggested that the </p>
<p>number recruited had risen to 7,000, when reporting that the Sons of Iraq might return </p>
<p>to “the streets of Basra” because the MOI had not paid them.</p>
<p>1339</p>
<p> General Adel had asked </p>
<p>for outstanding salaries to be paid immediately. He also requested “not to be sent any </p>
<p>more police officers as he ha[d] enough”. </p>
<p><b>The UK starts embedding troops with the Iraqi Army</b></p>
<p><b>1465. </b> On 2 April, a junior official in PJHQ wrote to Mr Browne, advising him that </p>
<p>MND(SE) was intending to embed MiTTs within 14th Division to strengthen “some of </p>
<p>the key vulnerabilities that ha[d] been demonstrated during recent operations”.</p>
<p>1340</p>
<p> It </p>
<p>would be “in a manner akin to the Operational Mentoring Liaison Team (OMLT) concept </p>
<p>successfully used in Afghanistan”. The US had “made it clear that they would welcome” </p>
<p>the move. The official stated:</p>
<p>“It is true to say that most armies around the world would have struggled in the </p>
<p>circumstances faced by 14 Div over the last two weeks. We should not therefore </p>
<p>rush to criticise what we were already aware was still some way from a properly </p>

<p>lack of situational awareness; a lack of clear command and control; poor planning; </p>
<p>and an inability to co&#8209;ordinate effectively with coalition assets and experience, in </p>
<p>particular with regards to calling on coalition forces for fire support and in extremis </p>
<p>extraction when these can only be delivered within coalition rules of engagement.”</p>
<p><b>1466. </b> On presentation, the official wrote that there were “many potential positives” but </p>
<p>it would be likely to raise questions about whether the UK handed Basra over to PIC too </p>
<p>early “and whether we have acted too late and only under pressure”. </p>
<p><b>1467. </b> The total number of military personnel involved was 150. </p>
<p><b>1468. </b> In Mr Browne’s absence, Mr Adam Ingram, the Minister for Armed Forces, </p>
<p>considered the advice on 3 April.</p>
<p>1341</p>
<p> Mr Ingram noted the advice and “emphasised the </p>
<p>need to ensure that personnel are clearly briefed on the red lines beyond which they </p>
<p>must not operate and the action to be taken in the event such lines are crossed”. He </p>
<p>“also asked that any evidence of behaviour by Iraqi forces with which UK personnel </p>
<p>had concerns be reported rapidly to Ministers”.</p>
<p><b>1469. </b> A note for Mr Browne was written on Mr Ingram’s response by Mr Browne’s </p>
<p>Private Secretary the same day.</p>
<p>1342</p>
<p> He reported that MiTTs were now deployed in Basra. </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“… It wasn’t so long ago that MiTTs/OMLTs [Operational Mentoring Liaison Teams] </p>
<p>in Iraq were thought to be a bad idea, but then, the situation has definitely changed </p>
<p>in the last week or so …</p>
<p>“Everyone appears to be content that the legal position is robust, but there are </p>
<p>clearly presentational risks in being seen to be drawn into town, while Warrior </p>
<p>back in Basra will not go unnoticed. It means 58 additional people will be </p>
<p>deployed but they’re temporary and will be invisible – we’re still at ‘around 4,000’ </p>
<p>established posts.”</p>
<p><b>1470. </b> Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner reported on 3 April that US MiTTs and the </p>
<p>“accompanying military resources they bring” were having a “significant supporting </p>

<p>1343</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1471. </b> On 4 April, Mr Jon Day, MOD Director General Operational Policy, advised </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>396</p>
<p><b>1472. </b> On 17 April, Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner reported that the UK MiTT concept was </p>
<p>continuing to evolve but was adding “real value to current operations”.</p>
<p>1345</p>
<p><b>Iraqi appointments</b></p>
<p>On 17 April 2008, Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner wrote that the senior Iraqi personnel </p>
<p>responsible for security in Basra were to be replaced:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Gen Mohan, Basra Operations Commander, was replaced by General </p>
<p>Mohammed (the former Commander 14th Division); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maj Gen Jalil, Provincial Director of Police, was replaced by General Adel </p>
<p>(a former police commander in Baghdad); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>General Abdul Aziz became Commander 14th Division.</p>
<p>1346</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1473. </b> In May, Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner’s weekly reports highlighted a number of </p>
<p>resource issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were no “suitable” armoured vehicles available for the UK MiTTs; the </p>
<p>choice being either Mastiff which was too large or Bulldog which was tracked.</p>
<p>1347</p>
<p> </p>
<p>US and Iraqi personnel used Humvees. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Substantial engineering work” was required to create “sustainable </p>
<p>accommodation and force protection of their locations across the city”.</p>
<p>1348</p>
<p> As a </p>
<p>consequence there was a requirement for reinforcements to free up engineering </p>
<p>squadrons who were currently undertaking guarding tasks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By 2 May, only two of a planned four brigades for 14th Division were </p>
<p>operational.</p>
<p>1349</p>
<p> There would be a further requirement for UK MiTTs when the </p>
<p>final two brigades came online, and delivering that requirement would require </p>
<p>“taking risk” against the Brigade Quick Reaction Force.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1474. </b> On 20 June, Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner reported that the full UK MiTT group was </p>
<p>in place.</p>
<p>1350</p>
<p> The Engineer Group was addressing “the considerable force protection and </p>
<p>environmental health risks that are currently being carried by MND(SE)”.</p>
<p><b>The future of the Iraqi police in Basra</b></p>
<p><b>1475. </b> On 1 April 2008, Mr Crispin Blunt suggested to Parliament that a large number </p>

<p>397</p>
<p>“The early attempts to create a police force in Iraq had exactly the results that the </p>
<p>Hon. Gentleman describes, as criminal elements came out of the police forces and </p>
<p>may, indeed, have deliberately gone into them in order to obtain training. Under </p>
<p>the generalship of General Jalil … we have dealt with that very problem during the </p>
<p>past year or more: a significant number of police officers have been dismissed from </p>
<p>the Iraqi police force, while others have been retrained to ensure that the situation </p>
<p>does not occur again. We have learned significant lessons from those early days of </p>
<p>police training, and we shall implement them in Afghanistan to ensure that we do not </p>
<p>repeat the problem.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1476. </b> On 10 April, Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner reported that the severe problems with </p>
<p>police officers were: </p>
<p>“… seen here partly as an issue of training (maybe the training teams had focused, </p>
<p>understandably, more on civilian policing skills than military tactics) but more as a </p>
<p>result of deep rooted corruption and lack of loyalty to the GOI.”</p>
<p>1352</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1477. </b> Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner warned that there were discussions in MNC&#8209;I and the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government over whether to disband the Basra police entirely and start again. </p>
<p>He also reported that MNC&#8209;I and CPATT were keen on the concept of Police Transition </p>
<p>Teams stating: “we will need to know how much appetite there is in the UK to provide </p>
<p>these.”</p>
<p><b>1478. </b> The following week, on 17 April, Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner wrote:</p>
<p>“… daily interaction with the IPS at the coalface (i.e. in their stations, of which there </p>
<p>are over 40) would require numbers in the high 100s to be successful, plus the </p>
<p>associated force protection. My feeling from the UK police team here is that the bill </p>
<p>would be too big for the UK to source, and would involve accepting a degree of risk </p>
<p>in their modus operandi which would be unwelcome. Our approach is therefore to </p>
<p>encourage maximum CPATT involvement and consequent injection of resources, </p>
<p>as the need to rebuild the police in Basra in the next six months remains urgent.”</p>

<p><b>1485. </b> On 22 July, Mr Brown made a statement to Parliament on the future strategy for </p>
<p>Iraq, as described in Section 9.7.</p>
<p>1360</p>
<p> He stated that, in response to “changing needs”, </p>
<p>the UK had now embedded more than 800 UK personnel within the Iraqi command </p>
<p>structure. He continued:</p>
<p>“The focus of the 4,100 forces still in southern Iraq is now on completing the task </p>
<p>of training and mentoring the 14th Division of the Iraqi Army in Basra … Other </p>
<p>remaining military tasks … include … continuing to develop the capacity of the Iraqi </p>
<p>navy and marines …”</p>
<p><b>1486. </b> On 19 August, Mr Nigel Haywood, the British Consul General in Basra, wrote that </p>
<p>the first US police training teams had deployed in Basra.</p>
<p>1361</p>
<p> Their first impression of the </p>
<p>IPS had been “positive”.</p>
<p><b>1487. </b> On 26 August, Mr Haywood reported a “milestone”: “the first visit downtown in </p>
<p>civilian vehicles (albeit armoured Land Cruisers with a Mastiff escort), and also the </p>
<p>first visit to the Governor’s office, for nearly two years”.</p>
<p>1362</p>
<p> Mr Haywood wrote that that </p>
<p>showed the UK’s confidence in the ISF, although acknowledged “we will be able to </p>
<p>demonstrate greater confidence, when we are able to travel in civilian vehicles without </p>
<p>a UK military escort”.</p>
<p><b>1488. </b> Mr Haywood reported that police training continued and had enabled the IPS to </p>
<p>produce a “Policing Plan for 09/10”. Forensic training also continued and a two&#8209;week </p>
<p>residential course had begun “introducing experienced IPS trainers to leadership </p>
<p>development to help them run new courses” later in 2008.</p>
<p><b>1489. </b> Mr Haywood also said that the contract to build the new Basra Central Prison had </p>
<p>been signed “after weeks of delay”. It was due for completion in a year. </p>
<p><b>1490. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Haywood described policing support at that time </p>
<p>as “community policing, use of forensic evidence, building up forensic laboratories”.</p>
<p>1363</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>“Arguably, those weren’t what was immediately needed in the period post&#8209;Charge </p>
<p>of the Knights, but it laid the groundwork for now what is becoming an increasingly </p>
<p>good policing system. If that hadn’t happened, then there would have been nothing </p>
<p>to build on.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>400</p>
<p><b>1492. </b> On 18 September, a JIC Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“Locally raised army units in the South will continue to need coalition mentors and to </p>
<p>operate alongside more experienced Iraqi forces to manage security for the rest of </p>
<p>this year. By early 2009, provided JAM remains quiescent, they will be able to cope </p>
<p>with only limited MNF mentoring … In the unlikely event of a widespread return to </p>
<p>violence we would expect local units to call for reinforcement by more experienced </p>
<p>Iraqi forces in the first instance. But they might ultimately still need to call on MNF </p>
<p>for specialist assistance.”</p>
<p>1365</p>
<p><b>1493. </b> On police effectiveness, the JIC Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“Interior Minister Boulani has taken steps to address police ineffectiveness. </p>
<p>However, despite an increase in MNF mentors and better vetting of police recruits, </p>
<p>we expect militia loyalty and corruption in the local police to remain serious problems </p>
<p>[…] The Army will have to retain overall responsibility for security for at least the next </p>
<p>few years.”</p>
<p><b>1494. </b> Mr John Hutton, the Defence Secretary, visited Iraq in October.</p>
<p>1366</p>
<p> In a letter to </p>
<p>Mr Brown, he wrote:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), the Army in particular, are looking confident and </p>
<p>capable. Their show of force in the areas which I visited, where they took the lead </p>
<p>in providing my security, was genuinely impressive. There is no doubt that Basra </p>
<p>itself has been transformed and the ISF now have complete freedom of movement </p>
<p>throughout the city. While they do not yet have all the capabilities that we would like </p>
<p>to see in a fully&#8209;formed Division, and there is important work still to do, we will soon </p>
<p>have reached the point where we can say with confidence that we have fulfilled our </p>
<p>training mission for 14 Division …”</p>
<p><b>1495. </b> On 16 December, the British Embassy Office Basra reported that the US military </p>
<p>police teams and IPAs had almost reached full deployment.</p>

<p><b>Training of 14th Division completed</b></p>
<p><b>1497. </b> On 27 March 2009, a junior official informed Mr Brown that 14th Division was </p>
<p>considered to be effective and that all UK mentors and trainers had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>1370</p>
<p><b>1498. </b> In his post&#8209;operation tour report on 15 May, Major General Andrew Salmon, </p>
<p>GOC MND(SE) from August 2008 until March 2009, assessed:</p>
<p>“There was considerable adaptation seen from our MiTTs who, given the </p>
<p>circumstances, did a great job. But this is a specialist game where maturity, linguistic </p>
<p>and teach, coach and mentor skills are required. A great MiTT made a huge </p>
<p>difference and enabled civil capacity; poor ones made little progress. Much of this </p>
<p>is down to training and selection, like the USMC [US Marine Corps] who provide </p>
<p>the benchmark. Our soldiers and officers also tend to approach their tasks through </p>
<p>the lens of the enemy as opposed to the lens of the people. We have much to learn </p>
<p>from our American colleagues … It was noticeable that US MiTTs were much better </p>
<p>prepared than ours.”</p>
<p>1371</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1499. </b> Maj Gen Salmon wrote that the decision to enable some UK MiTT elements to </p>
<p>travel in Iraqi Army vehicles “was a defining decision – pivotal in establishing trust and </p>
<p>building meaningful relationships at the tactical level”. There was “no doubt that the </p>
<p>(accurate or otherwise) US tactical perception of UK casualty aversion ha[d] been a </p>
<p>negative factor in coalition cohesion over the past 12 months”:</p>
<p>“Basra has arguably progressed from anarchy to democracy in 12 months. The </p>
<p>militias have been defeated and residual insurgent activity is limited and cellular </p>
<p>in nature. There is widespread recognition of the Rule of Law, with judicial </p>
<p>processes being developed to meet the need of a democratic society. To all intents, </p>
<p>14th Division has met the MNSTC&#8209;I mandated requirement of ORA 2 [Operational </p>
<p>Readiness Assessment level 2 – see Box, Provincial Iraqi Control’], under British </p>
<p>tutelage. In terms of wider Basrawi security, policing and border security have </p>
<p>improved considerably. Collectively, the ISF conducts intelligence&#8209;led coordinated </p>
<p>operations supported by an integral IO capability. The harmonisation of the ISF </p>
<p>requires further work but has improved markedly … UK Defence can withdraw from </p>
<p>Iraq having delivered on its promises and with its professional reputation intact.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>deployed in the province in an attempt to subdue it. The locals claim that they, rather </p>
<p>than coalition forces ‘liberated’ Maysan in 2003, and this helped explain the higher </p>
<p>levels of hostility to MND(SE) than elsewhere in the region.”</p>
<p>1372</p>
<p><b>1501. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Shirreff said:</p>
<p>“Maysan had always been a very difficult province. There was effectively no security </p>
<p>at all where MNF were concerned.”</p>
<p>1373</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1502. </b> On 9 July 2004, Commander Kevin Hurley, UK Senior Police Adviser Iraq (South), </p>
<p>reported that the Governor of Maysan province, Governor Riyadh, had been “implicated” </p>
<p>in the shooting of the local Chief of Police.</p>
<p>1374</p>
<p> Cdr Hurley wrote that the Governor’s </p>
<p>continued tenure was “a potential challenge to not only the development of a wholesome </p>
<p>policing ethic but also that of the wider democratic process”.</p>
<p><b>1503. </b> On 24 July, Mr Collis reported that Maysan province was fragile and stuck in </p>
<p>“political stagnation”.</p>
<p>1375</p>
<p> Although Prime Minister Allawi had suspended Governor </p>
<p>Riyadh, the Governor refused to acknowledge it and continued in his role. Mr Collis </p>
<p>attributed the “bad” economic situation to “35 years of neglect and the overnight loss of </p>
<p>its previous principal employer, the old Iraqi Army”. The deployment of police mentors </p>
<p>was “likely to be problematic on security grounds”.</p>
<p><b>1504. </b> By 28 July, Mr Collis wrote that the situation had “worsened”.</p>
<p>1376</p>
<p> A suspension </p>
<p>letter issued from Baghdad had been sent through low&#8209;level police channels, rather </p>
<p>than from Prime Minister Allawi, meaning Governor Riyadh either had not seen the </p>
<p>instructions, or was ignoring them. The Governor’s behaviour was causing concern for </p>
<p>some Council members and Mr Collis predicted that, without further action, he would </p>
<p>“continue to undermine those he sees as rivals and the scope for violence w[ould] rise”.</p>
<p><b>1505. </b> On 3 September, Mr Collis wrote that a cease&#8209;fire was agreed between the local </p>
<p>Office of the Martyr Sadr (OMS) leadership, the IPS and ING on 2 September and a </p>
<p>declaration was signed.</p>
<p>1377</p>
<p> Key points included a commitment to resolution 1564 (2004) </p>
<p>(allowing MNF freedom of movement whilst undertaking reconstruction work and IPS </p>
<p>training), and the IPS being given “the responsibility of upholding security”.</p>
<p><b>1506. </b> Mr Collis wrote that Maysan was still without an effective Governor. </p>
<p>The Governorate Council was incapable of electing a replacement as a result of </p>
<p>intimidation from Governor Riyadh’s brother, the tribal leader Mr Abu Hatim (“Prince of </p>
<p>the Marshes”). </p>

<p><b>1507. </b> On 21 September, Mr Collis reported that Governor Riyadh had been exonerated </p>
<p>by a Baghdad court but the circumstances surrounding his exoneration were unclear.</p>
<p>1378</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Abu Maythem, Chief of Police, had taken “one look at the letter exonerating Riyadh, </p>
<p>declared it a forgery and repeated his desire for justice to be served”. While Mr Maythem </p>
<p>agreed “the current situation was calmer than for a while”, he “believed fighting would </p>
<p>start up again soon”.</p>
<p><b>1508. </b> Mr Hatim looked most “likely to come out on top of this struggle”, appearing to </p>
<p>have “purged” the Council of anyone who opposed him and “worn down any opposition </p>
<p>in Baghdad to acquitting his brother”. There was “no sign” of General Rashash, Prime </p>
<p>Minister Allawi’s Security Co&#8209;ordinator, and Mr Maythem “appeared quite unaware” of </p>
<p>his appointment.</p>
<p><b>1509. </b> On 26 September, Mr Davies reported that as part of a deployment of 38 </p>
<p>ArmorGroup contractors, three contractors were deployed to Maysan to develop criminal </p>
<p>intelligence capability and mentor the TSU.</p>
<p>1379</p>
<p> Mr Davies also reported that the location </p>
<p>of the police in Maysan had “received some rocket and mortar fire during the week”.</p>
<p><b>1510. </b> On 15 October, Mr Collis stated that the security situation in Maysan remained </p>
<p>“superficially quiet” following the cease&#8209;fire, with “no serious attacks against the MNF for </p>
<p>several weeks”.</p>
<p>1380</p>
<p> The political struggle, however, continued. There had been a series </p>
<p>of high&#8209;profile murders and the perpetrators were unknown. Governor Riyadh had used </p>
<p>the opportunity to criticise Mr Maythem for failing to prevent the murders. The fall&#8209;out </p>
<p>from Mr Hatim’s ‘purge’ of the Council rumbled on. Mr Collis concluded:</p>
<p>“Maysan remains a sorry mess and a standing indictment of the new Iraq’s (and our) </p>
<p>failure to grip its linked problems of tribal warlordism, Iranian meddling, corruption </p>
<p>and extremism.” </p>
<p><b>1511. </b> On 24 October, the Chief of Police, who was being mentored by DCC White, was </p>
<p>murdered in al&#8209;Amara as he exited a mosque.</p>
<p>1381</p>
<p> Following that, a police committee was </p>
<p>established, with UK and Danish support, to oversee policing, including the selection of </p>
<p>a new Chief of Police. </p>

<p>“Real progress has been made in Maysan, although none of it is irreversible and we </p>
<p>need to ensure adequate resources are in place to maintain SSR and reconstruction </p>

<p>1382</p>
<p><b>1513. </b> On 21 February, the FCO strategy for support to policing in Iraq in 2005 noted </p>
<p>that the GCPP had approved additional funding to ArmorGroup to allow mentoring to be </p>
<p>undertaken in Maysan.</p>
<p>1383</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1514. </b> By April, 20 ArmorGroup contractors were deployed under the co&#8209;ordination of a </p>
<p>UK police Chief Inspector.</p>
<p>1384</p>
<p> They were supported by four CPATT mentors.</p>
<p><b>1515. </b> The FCO produced an IPS Transition Plan on 7 September.</p>
<p>1385</p>
<p> It stated that </p>
<p>57 percent of the IPS in Maysan had completed basic training and 93 percent had </p>
<p>undertaken other specialist training. The FCO judged that training was “largely on track” </p>
<p>and “transition targets should be met if co&#8209;operation continues”.</p>
<p><b>1516. </b> On 10 October, Mr Wheeler produced an update of policing in each of the four </p>
<p>MND(SE) provinces.</p>
<p>1386</p>
<p> On Maysan, he said:</p>
<p>“The lack of co&#8209;operation by the Chief of Police has had a particularly detrimental </p>
<p>effect on what we have been able to achieve eg many police stations have still not </p>
<p>been visited by PAT. The security situation has constrained the work of PAT, and </p>
<p>CPATT and the Royal Military Police have been trying to fill the gap. And IPS/militia </p>
<p>affiliation is considerable eg there have been instances of IPS complicity in attacks </p>
<p>on MNF forces. The Chief of Police has been unwilling to be mentored. Very recently </p>
<p>he has withdrawn his students and instructors from the training programme, claiming </p>
<p>that ArmorGroup are not up to the job … Abuse of prisoners is still occurring … The </p>
<p>PJOC is fully equipped, but there is disagreement between the IPS, the Iraqi Army </p>
<p>and the Governor on its role …”</p>
<p><b>1517. </b> Mr Tansley visited Maysan from 2 to 3 December.</p>
<p>1387</p>
<p> He reported that the area </p>
<p>“belie[d] its reputation” for being “lawless”. It had been “relatively peaceful in recent </p>
<p>months” with a lower number of attacks on MND(SE) than in Basra, and no attacks on </p>
<p>the ISF since November. Despite that, Mr Tansley reported that the threat remained </p>
<p>“relatively high”. He wrote:</p>
<p>“… beneath the surface there is an underlying tension. Unlike in neighbouring Dhi </p>
<p>Qar, the (relative) stability depends on an uneasy balance of power between the </p>
<p>Badrists and Sadrists, rather than co&#8209;operation. The potential for the situation to </p>

<p>1388</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1519. </b> On 20 January 2006, Mr Tansley provided an update on the readiness of Maysan </p>
<p>for handover to Iraqi control.</p>
<p>1389</p>
<p> It stated that the Iraqi Army was of “adequate standard” </p>
<p>though suffered from logistical issues; the DBE was “inadequate in size (7,000)” but </p>
<p>was “judged to be acting effectively”; and reform of the police was “going well” despite </p>

<p><b>1523. </b> The Chief of Police had also reported difficulties with the Head of the OMS in </p>
<p>Maysan who “wanted to commit acts of terror, but the Governor was trying to keep a lid </p>
<p>on the strife”. It was thought that extremist elements were “attempting to gain kudos and </p>

<p>1393</p>
<p> Security conditions were “less favourable” </p>
<p>than in Muthanna but a continued coalition presence could be “counter&#8209;productive”. </p>

<p>vehicles and black&#8209;clad militiamen with slung RPGs [Rocket Propelled Grenades], </p>
<p>the news is not all bad. Events were kicked off with the killing of the (Badr) Head of </p>
<p>the Criminal Intelligence Unit by JAM, resulting in the arrest (and subsequent killing) </p>
<p>of the brother of the leader of Amara JAM by the IPS. In response JAM attacked the </p>

<p>Badr/JAM (or tribes – that we don’t really know which is symptomatic of the lack of </p>
<p>clear knowledge on the ground) threaten to shape up for another bout; Iranian angle </p>
<p>(I’ll leave it at that) likely to become hot from early Jan with obvious risks for Maysan </p>
<p>(and, indeed Basra); and there is an ESC [Emergency Security Committee] still in </p>
<p>place … To argue forcefully for Maysan to transition in these circumstances strikes </p>
<p>me as a touch Nelsonian. Or did Strategy Group take all these factors into account </p>
<p>when deciding we should get [Dr] Rubaie to ‘press hard’ at MCNS next week?”</p>
<p>1398</p>
<p><b>1533. </b> On 25 January 2007, Mr Asquith reported that the MNF were unable to visit police </p>
<p>stations in the centre of town, and relied on police to meet them on the city perimeter.</p>
<p>1399</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1534. </b> On 14 March, the British Embassy Office Basra reported that it was continuing to </p>
<p>push that Maysan was ready for transition: “Our approach with the US – that Maysan is </p>
<p>not perfect, but it is good enough – appears to be working.”</p>
<p>1400</p>
<p> Prime Minister Maliki had </p>
<p>disbanded the Emergency Security Committee on 7 January and “sacked” the Chief of </p>
<p>Police Mr Maythem, replacing him with General Hassan. </p>
<p><b>1535. </b> The Embassy stated that there was “a lot of anecdotal evidence of arms </p>
<p>smuggling” across Maysan’s border, and “regular press reports of arms smuggling and </p>
<p>militants crossing”, but no “concrete evidence”. The local Chief of the DBE was “weak” </p>
<p>and the MOI was “looking to replace him”. While there had been attempts to close the </p>
<p>border and improve infrastructure, the Iraqi Government was concerned about the </p>
<p>potentially negative impact on the local economy. MND(SE) would continue patrolling </p>
<p>the border after transition. The Embassy stated:</p>
<p>“The border issue will not be easily solved; it is a source of wealth as well as </p>
<p>weapons.”</p>
<p><b>1536. </b> On 3 May, Mr Sheinwald reported to Mr Blair that ACM Stirrup saw no utility in </p>
<p>the Maysan border&#8209;monitoring role.</p>
<p>1401</p>
<p> It was not preventing incoming arms, nor acting </p>
<p>as a deterrent. However, ACM Stirrup did not want to “make an early move”, given US </p>
<p>sensitivities in relation to Iran.</p>
<p><b>1537. </b> On 4 April, the Iraqi Government announced that Maysan would transfer to PIC </p>
<p>on 18 April.</p>
<p>1402</p>
<p><b>1538. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Shaw described the reason for the </p>
<p>decision to transfer Maysan to PIC at that time:</p>
<p>“What happened in Maysan was not that there was any blinding flash of new </p>
<p>security, but, rather, that the situation in Maysan had been stable for long enough, in </p>

<p>the basis, not that that handed it over to the militia, but actually that it was as good </p>
<p>as it was going to get …”</p>
<p>1403</p>
<p><b>1539. </b> On 19 April, Mr Richard Jones, the British Consul General in Basra, reported that, </p>
<p>at the transfer ceremony for PIC, Dr Rubaie had described the transition as “another </p>
<p>expression of Iraqi will”.</p>
<p>1404</p>
<p><b>1540. </b> Mr Jones wrote that the handover was immediately overshadowed by an IED </p>
<p>attack in the north&#8209;west of the province which had left two UK soldiers dead</p>
<p>1405</p>
<p> and one </p>
<p>seriously injured. He concluded:</p>
<p>“As we have reported … Maysan has always been a tough, lawless place. The </p>
<p>question is whether the broad local balance can continue. It has held pretty well </p>
<p>since the de facto withdrawal of coalition forces (apart largely from the border) and </p>
<p>the violence last Ramadan.”</p>
<p><b>1541. </b> Maj Gen Binns, in his evidence to the Inquiry, recalled ongoing concerns about </p>
<p>post&#8209;PIC border infiltration:</p>
<p>“[Lt Gen Odierno] ordered me to conduct operations on the border with Iran in order </p>
<p>to disrupt the flow of what he described as lethal aid … He was concerned about the </p>
<p>border crossing points and he was concerned about infiltration through the marsh </p>
<p>area in Maysan province.</p>
<p>“So from September onwards, we started to conduct a series of operations which </p>
<p>became known as Operation CERTAIN SHIELD into the border area.</p>
<p>“I think they may have been effective as a deterrence, but we didn’t find </p>
<p>anything …”</p>
<p>1406</p>
<p><b>1542. </b> Maj Gen Binns went on to reflect that capacity&#8209;building was a useful area on </p>
<p>which to focus:</p>
<p>“… a good way of achieving what we needed to achieve was to develop the </p>
<p>capabilities of the Department of Border Enforcement … So we improved our </p>
<p>relationship with them.”</p>
<p><b>UK police officer numbers 2003 to 2009</b></p>
<p><b>1543. </b> As with civilian personnel (described in Section 15.1), there was no single </p>
<p>continuous record for the number of UK police officers deployed to Iraq. How numbers </p>
<p>were recorded varied considerably in relation to:</p>
