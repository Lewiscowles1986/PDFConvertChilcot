<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparation for the deployment of UK civilian personnel to Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the recruitment and deployment of civilian personnel between 2003 and 2009;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>duty of care and protective security measures;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognition of service;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support to locally engaged (LE) staff; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>skills and seniority.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the recruitment, deployment or impact of UK police officers in Iraq, addressed </p>
<p>in Section 12;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the contribution of civilian personnel to the reconstruction of post&#8209;conflict Iraq, </p>
<p>addressed in Section 10;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the funding of civilian deployments, including the cost of protective security </p>
<p>measures, addressed in Section 13; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s review of the UK approach to post&#8209;conflict reconstruction and </p>
<p>stabilisation, and the creation of a deployable UK civilian standby capability, </p>
<p>addressed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4.</p>
<p><b>Terms used in this Section</b></p>
<p><b>UK&#8209;based staff. </b>UK Government employees deployed to Iraq for a defined period, usually </p>
<p>between six months and one year.</p>
<p><b>Locally engaged (LE) staff. </b>Staff recruited and employed in Iraq by the UK Government. </p>
<p>Sometimes referred to as “locally employed staff” or “locally engaged civilians”.</p>
<p><b>Contractor.</b> Used in this report for all personnel hired by UK (and US) government </p>
<p>departments on fixed&#8209;term contracts, including those referred to in contemporary </p>
<p>documents as “consultants”. </p>
<p><b>Consultant.</b> Usually refers to contractors providing specialist technical advice. Widely </p>
<p>used in contemporary documents and by witnesses to the Inquiry in place of “contractor”.</p>
<p><b>Personnel. </b>All<b> </b>staff and contractors.</p>
<p><b>Secondee.</b> An individual deployed temporarily to another organisation.</p>
<p><b>Civilian outreach event</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> In June 2010, the Inquiry held an outreach event for civilians who had served in Iraq </p>
<p>between 2003 and 2009. A total of 48 people took part from a range of departments, </p>
<p>including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Ministry of Defence (MOD) </p>
<p>and the Department for International Development (DFID). No contractors responded </p>
<p>to the invitation. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Participants were divided into three working groups:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) period (18 participants);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mid&#8209;2004 to mid&#8209;2007 (21 participants); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mid&#8209;2007 to mid&#8209;2009 (nine participants). </p>
<p><b>5. </b> Each working group discussed two themes: “Strategy and Delivery” and </p>
<p>“Support to Staff”.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Views expressed during the event appear where appropriate in this Section. </p>
<p><b>Pre&#8209;invasion planning and preparation</b></p>
<p><b>7. </b> Sections 6.4 and 6.5 address the shortcomings in the UK Government’s planning and </p>
<p>preparation for a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> When the invasion of Iraq began overnight on 19/20 March 2003, there had been </p>
<p>no systematic analysis of the availability of civilian personnel to meet the UK’s  </p>
<p>likely obligations in post&#8209;conflict Iraq.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Factors shaping the Government’s pre&#8209;conflict approach to civilian deployments </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inadequate planning machinery;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of a comprehensive strategy for post&#8209;conflict Iraq, which could have </p>
<p>informed a cross&#8209;Whitehall assessment of the civilian requirement; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an assumption that, after a short transitional phase led by the US, the </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict administration and reconstruction of Iraq would be run and staffed </p>
<p>by the international community, led by the UN, allowing the UK to limit its </p>
<p>contribution to provision of financial resources and targeted advice delivered </p>
<p>by a small number of civilian specialists;</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID’s limited operational capacity; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>concerns about the legal status of UK secondees working for the US&#8209;led Office </p>
<p>for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure to decide whether the UK should assume overall responsibility for </p>
<p>a geographical sector of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> In the months before the invasion, the UK Government made preparations for </p>
<p>civilian deployment to Iraq in four areas:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cross&#8209;government support to ORHA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID humanitarian support to the UK military and international organisations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>FCO staff for the British Embassy Baghdad; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD civilians supporting Operation (Op) TELIC.</p>

<p>1 </p>
<p>Paper FCO, [undated], ‘Scenarios for the future of Iraq after Saddam’; Letter Chilcott to Ward, </p>
<p>24 February 2003, ‘ORHA’. </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>Operation TELIC was the codename for the involvement of UK Armed Forces in the military campaign </p>
<p>in Iraq from 2003 to 2011.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>15.1  |  Civilian personnel</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>ORHA</b></p>
<p><b>11. </b> ORHA was created by the US in January 2003.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> It was led by retired US Lieutenant </p>
<p>General Jay Garner and reported to the Department of Defense (DoD). </p>
<p><b>12. </b> The UK’s approach to ORHA in the weeks before the invasion of Iraq is described </p>
<p>in Section 6.5. UK concerns during that period included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DoD’s assumption of responsibility for all US post&#8209;conflict planning and the </p>
<p>marginalisation of the State Department;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the limited time available to ORHA to plan and prepare for the post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>phase of operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persistent shortcomings in those preparations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>legal concerns, in the absence of a UN mandate for the administration and </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq, about the compatibility of certain post&#8209;conflict activities </p>
<p>with the rules of military occupation, and the implications for any UK secondees </p>
<p>serving with ORHA; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a shortage of information about ORHA’s staffing requirements and, as a </p>
<p>consequence, the contribution that should be made by the UK.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The UK Government’s response to those concerns and the evolution of its policy </p>
<p>towards ORHA during March and April 2003 are addressed in Sections 6.5 and 10.1. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> In February 2003, the Government seconded a small number of officials and military </p>
<p>officers to ORHA. The Inquiry has seen little evidence of formal inter&#8209;departmental </p>
<p>discussion of the appointment process.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> The first UK secondee, appointed in February 2003, and the senior UK member of </p>
<p>ORHA was Major General Tim Cross.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Maj Gen Cross had recent and relevant experience of planning for conflict in Iraq.  </p>
<p>In the second half of 2002 he had worked as Logistic Component Commander of the </p>
<p>Joint Force being prepared for possible operations against Iraq. He returned to the UK </p>
<p>in late 2002. </p>
<p><b>17. </b> Maj Gen Cross told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I had been back only a short time at my desk, where I was the Director General of </p>
<p>the defence supply chain, a couple of weeks and the phone rang literally out of the </p>
<p>blue, and they</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> just said we want you to go. To be honest, I wasn’t surprised.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>18. </b> The record of the FCO Iraq Morning Meeting on 4 February 2003 stated that </p>
<p>the US had requested “a broader UK team (in addition to our MOD representative </p>
<p>[Maj Gen Cross])”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> FCO officials would check Personnel Directorate’s</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> progress </p>
<p>in identifying “an FCO representative”. DFID was also considering sending a </p>
<p>representative.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, was reluctant to </p>
<p>second DFID officials to ORHA in the absence of a UN mandate for reconstruction </p>
<p>(see Section 6.5). On 20 February, Ms Short agreed that one DFID representative </p>
<p>should work with, but not in, ORHA “on a temporary basis” to “influence and help </p>
<p>with the planning of the Office”.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> A DFID official was appointed “temporary humanitarian adviser” to Maj Gen Cross </p>
<p>later in February.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The record of the FCO’s Iraq Evening Meeting on 27 February stated: “ORHA needs </p>
<p>strengthening – we are looking for a volunteer.” </p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>22. </b> On 27 February, Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, warned </p>
<p>that ORHA was “woefully understaffed”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> He suggested that officials earmarked for </p>
<p>the British Embassy Baghdad should be sent to help.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> On 6 March, Maj Gen Cross informed the MOD, the FCO and DFID that he </p>
<p>expected the requirements for Lt Gen Garner’s “Top Team” to become clear the following </p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> In the meantime, he believed that two UK military officers might be able to </p>
<p>join him from the US Central Command (CENTCOM) in Tampa. He reported that, </p>
<p>on the civilian side, DFID’s humanitarian adviser continued “to explore how ORHA’s </p>
<p>humanitarian plans are developing” and an FCO official had been identified as UK </p>
<p>liaison officer for ORHA’s back office in the US.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The record of the FCO Iraq Morning Meeting on 10 March stated that ORHA had </p>
<p>been “strengthened with three further UK officers”, two from the FCO and one from </p>
<p>British Trade International (BTI).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>25. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on 16 March that five UK secondees had </p>
<p>deployed with ORHA to Kuwait: Maj Gen Cross, a second military officer and the three </p>
<p>civilians from the FCO and Trade Partners UK (TPUK), the division of BTI responsible </p>

<p> DFID had also agreed formally to second an official to </p>
<p>ORHA’s humanitarian assistance division. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> On 17 March, an official in the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat </p>
<p>(OD Sec) informed Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of </p>
<p>OD Sec, that Maj Gen Cross had asked whether a suitable UK official was available </p>
<p>to improve ORHA’s capacity to handle Arabic&#8209;language media.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Concerns about the adequacy of the UK contribution to ORHA began to grow soon </p>
<p>after the start of the invasion and are addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>DFID humanitarian advisers</b></p>
<p><b>28. </b> On 3 February, DFID officials recommended to Ms Short that DFID second six civil/</p>
<p>military humanitarian advisers to the UK military and ORHA, in order “to take further </p>
<p>forward our objective of refining the military planning options to ensure the humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences of any conflict in Iraq are fully addressed”.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>29. </b> The Inquiry has not seen Ms Short’s response to the advice, but DFID did second </p>
<p>a number of staff over the following weeks.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> On 7 March, DFID informed Mr Blair that, in addition to the DFID presence in ORHA, </p>
<p>there was now a DFID staff presence in the 1st (UK) Armoured Division (1 (UK) Div) in </p>
<p>Kuwait, with further deployments to the region and UN agencies imminent.</p>

<p>“Information Management”. Staff from the Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs </p>
<p>Department Operations Team (CHAD OT) would be deployed to Kuwait and </p>
<p>Jordan to collate, analyse and disseminate field information. DFID was also </p>
<p>evaluating the need to send staff to Turkey, Iran and Cyprus, and would retain </p>
<p>a limited capacity to deploy assessment teams to localised crisis points.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Direct Support to the UN”. DFID was seconding specialists to support the </p>

<p><b>The British Embassy Baghdad</b></p>
<p><b>33. </b> In September 2002, the FCO began preparations for the reopening of a British </p>
<p>Embassy in Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> On 27 September, Mr Peter Collecott, FCO Director General Corporate Affairs,</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p>briefed Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary (PUS),</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> on plans for </p>
<p>reopening the British Embassy:</p>
<p>“Based on the Kabul experience, we are planning for an Embassy of, initially, </p>
<p>11 FCO staff (plus 6 from OGDs [other government departments] and 12 Close </p>
<p>Protection Officers). We have begun the process of identifying possible staff. </p>
<p>On the technical side … we have likely volunteers.” </p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Collecott emphasised the importance of committing immediately to the capital </p>
<p>expenditure required, including for “armoured vehicles, portable accommodation and ICT </p>
<p>equipment”. The lead time for armoured vehicles in particular was very long: 20 weeks, </p>
<p>which would mean delivery in late February or early March 2003.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> On public presentation, Mr Collecott advised:</p>
<p>“Our major, and most visible, expenditure will be on equipment for Baghdad. That is </p>
<p>defensible on the grounds that this is prudent planning; re&#8209;establishment in Baghdad </p>
<p>does not necessarily imply a military campaign or indeed regime change; and that </p>
<p>we have a commitment to the FAC (Foreign Affairs Committee) to have a rapidly </p>
<p>deployable Embassy for use anywhere.”</p>

<p>Until late 2002 the DG Corporate Affairs was known as the FCO Chief Clerk.</p>
<p>22 </p>
<p>In keeping with variations in use within departments, the Inquiry refers to the most senior civil servant </p>
<p>in the FCO and the MOD as the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), but in all other departments as the </p>
<p>Permanent Secretary. The Permanent Under Secretaries and Permanent Secretaries are referred to </p>
<p>collectively as Permanent Secretaries.</p>

<p><b>37. </b> The recruitment of staff for the new Embassy was part of a wider redeployment of </p>
<p>FCO staff in response to developments in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>38. </b> On 20 March 2003, Sir Michael Jay informed Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, </p>
<p>that “almost five percent of FCO staff in London” had been redeployed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>51 staff had been redeployed to the main Emergency Unit;</p>

<p>“Plans are in place for a two&#8209;phase re&#8209;occupation of the site [of the former British </p>
<p>Embassy] as soon as hostilities are over, and military ordnance personnel have </p>
<p>declared the site safe … These plans have had to be made on the basis of worst </p>
<p>case assumptions – an insecure environment; no secure office buildings or </p>
<p>accommodation available off&#8209;compound; no available utilities.” </p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>41. </b> Mr Collecott explained that, in phase one, five specially converted containers would </p>
<p>arrive in Kuwait on 26 March to be transported to Baghdad as soon as the route was </p>
<p>safe. The containers would provide living and office accommodation for a team of four, </p>
<p>led by Mr Chris Segar, a senior FCO official, and would be self&#8209;sufficient in power and </p>
<p>water. Mr Segar’s team would have secure communications from the outset.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Phase two would begin in the first week of May and involve installation of a </p>
<p>protected prefabricated flat pack Embassy, with its own water, drainage and power </p>
<p>supply, and secure living and working accommodation for 44 staff, including close </p>
<p>protection officers. Construction of the Embassy would take 12 weeks. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> Mr Collecott explained that the timetable was based on transport by sea and </p>
<p>land. The FCO would be exposed to “a very awkward period” if Baghdad returned to </p>
<p>“relative normality” quickly and pressure mounted rapidly to expand the UK presence. </p>
<p>Two or three weeks could be saved if the flat pack containers and other equipment were </p>
<p>flown into Baghdad. The FCO was “keeping open the option of calling in a debt with </p>
<p>the Americans by asking them to transport the flat pack equipment and containers to </p>
<p>Baghdad. (The RAF are not at all sure they can help.)”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>44. </b> On 11 April, Mr Charles Gray, Head of FCO Middle East Department, told Mr Straw </p>
<p>that the plans were on course.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> FCO Personnel Directorate was identifying a pool of </p>
<p>staff at all grades willing to serve in Baghdad in the medium to long term. The aim was </p>
<p>to deploy staff for one year “to avoid the rapid and disruptive turnover experienced in the </p>
<p>early days of our redeployment to Kabul”. When permanent quarters were found, the flat </p>
<p>pack Embassy would be returned to the UK for use elsewhere. </p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr Gray advised that security was a priority. Staff could not be put into a situation </p>
<p>in which the FCO could not fulfil its duty of care. Before Mr Segar’s party and the close </p>
<p>protection team travelled, the MOD and Assessments Staff needed to conclude that </p>
<p>the situation was calm enough in the city as whole, not just in the area immediately </p>
<p>surrounding the compound. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Gray added that it had not been decided how to secure the compound </p>
<p>perimeter. Relying on the US military or a private security company would be politically </p>
<p>unacceptable and locally engaged (LE) Iraqi guards would not be a realistic option in the </p>
<p>short term. The British Army was the only realistic alternative. The MOD was considering </p>
<p>the issue, but would “take some persuasion to redeploy to Baghdad from the South in </p>
<p>what would in effect be a full company, even for a short deployment (and the cost to </p>
<p>the FCO will be high)”. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> On 30 April, Mr Gray reported that planning for opening the mission in Baghdad, </p>
<p>under the provisional name of “The British Office”, was in its final stages.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> The staff, </p>
<p>the flat pack Embassy and four armoured vehicles were scheduled to arrive in Baghdad </p>
<p>on 5 or 6 May. </p>

<p>253</p>
<p><b>50. </b> In Iraq, the MOD also deployed civilians in advisory roles outside Op TELIC, </p>
<p>including in the CPA and the UK’s bilateral diplomatic missions.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> On 14 February 2003, Mr John Pitt&#8209;Brooke, MOD Director General Civilian </p>
<p>Personnel, reported that the MOD had been “successful in getting people lined up for </p>
<p>quick deployment into theatre”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> There were about 25 Permanent Joint Headquarters </p>
<p>(PJHQ)&#8209;sponsored civilian posts across the Middle East. Some individuals had already </p>
<p>deployed; others would do so over the following weeks. Other parts of the MOD would </p>
<p>be deploying specialist staff to their own timetable. </p>
<p><b>52. </b> Mr Pitt&#8209;Brooke expressed concern that the approach to deployments across </p>
<p>departments within the MOD had not been as consistent or coherent as it should have </p>
<p>been. Key issues were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Management information: there was no central record of those deployed, </p>
<p>“which we need for tracking people in theatre, providing the appropriate medical </p>
<p>and welfare support, etc. We are working on gripping this quickly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Risk assessment: individuals needed more clarity about potential risks. A single </p>
<p>source of guidance needed to be published urgently.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Training: the approach had been inconsistent.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Availability of equipment: current arrangements were “less than the individual </p>
<p>has a right to expect”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Briefing and travel allowance arrangements.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Medical, welfare and insurance issues: “The lack of consistent, readily available </p>
<p>advice on medical issues … and the lack of a single point of contact for advice </p>
<p>may be aspects that we could improve upon.”</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Mr Pitt&#8209;Brooke advised that a new “focal point” had been set up in PJHQ to address </p>
<p>those issues. New arrangements would be in place on 19 February. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> In response, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the MOD PUS, instructed officials to “bear in mind the </p>
<p>need for wider post&#8209;conflict planning. OGDs sh[oul]d bear the brunt, but we are likely to </p>
<p>need MOD people as well.” </p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>55. </b> On 31 March, Mr Paul Flaherty, MOD Civil Secretary at PJHQ, informed Sir Kevin </p>
<p>that 156 civilians had been deployed to theatre in support of Op TELIC, the largest </p>
<p>number in the Warship Support Agency, and that numbers fluctuated from day to day.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Mr Flaherty reported that civilians had been deployed at all grades “in a range of </p>
<p>roles including finance, administration, claims, salvage, RFA [Royal Fleet Auxiliary], </p>
<p>communications, POLAD etc”. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr Flaherty confirmed that the MOD Civilian Deployment Co&#8209;ordination cell had </p>
<p>been established at PJHQ. For the first time, co&#8209;ordinated guidance had been made </p>
<p>available to civilians deployed on Op TELIC and a pre&#8209;deployment training strategy </p>
<p>had been established. </p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Flaherty added:</p>
<p>“There is a great deal for the new cell to do, but an important current priority is </p>
<p>constructing a register of the names, and other relevant details, of civilians who are </p>
<p>deployed. The new cell is working to render this sort of information as complete and </p>
<p>reliable as possible.”</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit described 156 as “a significant number for deployed personnel, </p>
<p>notwithstanding that just over half that number are Royal Fleet Auxiliaries”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> He attached </p>
<p>importance to the provision of “proper support for families” and expressed the hope that </p>
<p>the co&#8209;ordination cell would pay attention to morale, as well as training. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> Sir Kevin also requested, as a matter of urgency, advice on arrangements for </p>
<p>dealing with civilian deaths.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Mr Richard Hatfield, MOD Personnel Director, explained that any MOD civilians and </p>
<p>accredited war correspondents killed in Iraq would be subject to the same overarching </p>
<p>policy as service personnel.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> Any MOD civilians would be returned to the UK alongside </p>
<p>service personnel and would have the same treatment on arrival, including ceremonial, </p>
<p>if that was the wish of the next of kin. MOD civilians were Crown servants operating </p>
<p>in direct support of the military in a theatre of war. To offer less might cause offence or </p>
<p>embarrassment to the families. For accredited journalists, it was proposed to confine the </p>
<p>policy to flying the body home, with no ceremonial.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Hatfield reassured Sir Kevin Tebbit that work was “in step” on wider Op TELIC&#8209; </p>
<p>related civilian and service personnel issues.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>two DFID humanitarian experts to advise 1 (UK) Div;</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>71. </b> On 1 April, the IPU advised Mr Straw on the UK’s future engagement with ORHA.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IPU assessed that, while ORHA was “in many ways a sub&#8209;optimal organisation </p>
<p>for delivering the UK’s Phase IV</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> objectives”, it was “the only game in town”. There </p>
<p>was, however, “ample scope” to use UK secondees to exert leverage over US Phase </p>
<p>IV planning and implementation. The IPU recommended that the UK should continue </p>
<p>to commit resources to ORHA where the UK “could add real value and exert influence </p>
<p>over emerging US perspectives and plans”. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> The IPU also recommended that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to make clear to the US the limits within which the UK, including UK </p>
<p>personnel within ORHA, could operate;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seek close consultation on ORHA’s plans, to ensure that they did not cross UK </p>
<p>“red lines”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>subject to those points, confirm Maj Gen Cross as Deputy to Lt Gen Garner. </p>
<p><b>73. </b> The IPU reported that ORHA, which at that stage was in Kuwait, had approximately </p>
<p>200 staff, expected to rise to over 1,000 by the time it deployed to Iraq. The UK and </p>
<p>Australia each had six officers seconded to ORHA. Five more UK secondees were </p>
<p>“in the pipeline” and one was working in ORHA’s back office in the Pentagon. The UK </p>
<p>secondees were “fully integrated” and “adding significant value”. At ORHA’s request, the </p>
<p>IPU was considering whether to strengthen UK representation, particularly in the areas </p>
<p>of public relations, civil administration and humanitarian operations. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> On 2 April, Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, sent Sir David Manning an </p>
<p>earlier version of the IPU paper, which identified areas in which the UK was considering </p>
<p>strengthening its representation: public relations, civil administration, humanitarian </p>
<p>advice and administrative support for existing secondees.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, warned </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 3 April that the UK was “in danger of being left behind” on </p>
<p>ORHA.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> The list of senior officials to “shadow” ministries in Iraq was almost complete </p>
<p>and those officials would start deploying soon. Australia had bid for a place. The UK had </p>
<p>not, even though the US had said it would be open to such a bid. Mr Brenton advised </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“Following our significant military efforts we surely have an interest in following </p>
<p>through to the civilian phase. If so, given the advanced state of US preparations, </p>
<p>it will be important that we vigorously pursue the point at next week’s talks [at </p>

<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Straw visited ORHA in Kuwait on 14 April.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> During the visit, Maj Gen Cross </p>
<p>handed Mr Straw a copy of his ‘Must&#8209;Could&#8209;Should’ paper (see Section 10.1). The </p>
<p>paper, which was sent to the MOD and the IPU on 15 April, identified ORHA posts that </p>
<p>UK secondees must fill, should fill or could fill “to best help ORHA achieve success”.</p>

<p><b>79. </b> Maj Gen Cross advised that, if all the recommendations were accepted, the number </p>
<p>of UK staff would rise from 19 to “about 100” within an ORHA total of 1,500 (including </p>
<p>force protection and support staff).</p>
<p><b>80. </b> On 15 April, Mr Straw recommended to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… a step change in the resources and personnel we offer … We are working </p>
<p>urgently to establish where we can best make a contribution and how this will  </p>
<p>be funded.</p>
<p>“We now need an immediate effort across government and with the private sector </p>
<p>to get UK experts into key Iraqi ministries quickly. Patricia [Hewitt, the Trade </p>
<p>and Industry Secretary] is particularly keen that we should appoint people to the </p>
<p>economic ministries …”</p>
<p><b>81. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“I could not believe the shambles before my eyes. There were around forty people in </p>
<p>the room, who, somehow or other, were going to be the nucleus of the government </p>
<p>of this large, disputatious and traumatised nation.” </p>

<p><b>83. </b> Sir Michael Jay informed Mr Straw on 16 April that he had reached agreement with </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, on “the modalities for deploying experts from </p>
<p>central government, plus experts from eg the NHS and local government”.</p>
<p>55</p>

<p>collective decisions quickly if this project is to [get] under way.” </p>
<p>56</p>
<p> Sir Andrew identified </p>
<p>two problems: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not clear that ORHA had reached the right conclusions about what was </p>
<p>needed, or that ORHA’s view of its role was shared by the UK. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK needed to decide on the scale and precise roles of UK secondees and </p>
<p>to reach agreement on how to finance the activity. </p>
<p><b>85. </b> On 17 April, Mr Blair agreed that the UK should “increase significantly the level of … </p>
<p>political and practical support to ORHA, including the secondment of significant numbers </p>
<p>of staff in priority areas”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> Mr Blair added that: </p>

<p><b>89. </b> In the absence of contingency preparations for the deployment of more than a </p>
<p>handful of UK civilians to Iraq, officials urgently sought: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cross&#8209;Whitehall agreement on the detailed arrangements for recruitment and </p>
<p>deployment of individuals from a range of different organisations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreement with ORHA on the level of support it would provide UK secondees; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>detailed information on secondees’ roles in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Sir Michael Jay launched the recruitment process on 22 April, sending a request for </p>
<p>volunteers to Sir Andrew Turnbull and all Whitehall Permanent Secretaries.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>91. </b> Sir Michael included a list of priority positions for UK secondees based on </p>
<p>recommendations from Maj Gen Cross (see Section 10.1). Sir Michael described </p>
<p>in broad terms the personal qualities and skills volunteers should possess:</p>
<p>“The key to a successful secondment will be enthusiasm, personal impact, </p>
<p>resilience, flexibility and the ability to take a wide top&#8209;down view of policy and </p>
<p>priorities. The ability to deploy quickly is also essential: ideally we want the first </p>
<p>volunteers to reach Baghdad by around 5 May to allow them to help shape  </p>
<p>ORHA’s work and approach from the start. We expect secondments to last  </p>
<p>between three and six months, depending on the requirements of ORHA and the </p>
<p>Iraqi ministry concerned.</p>
<p>“I hope you will take a broad view in looking for volunteers … you might consider </p>
<p>suggesting secondment of officials on your books but not currently employed … </p>
<p>I hope you will also consider drawing people from your wider pool of stakeholders </p>
<p>– I would, for example, welcome volunteers from eg police authorities, quangos or </p>
<p>NHS trusts.</p>
<p>“In all cases, enthusiasm and personal qualities are likely to be just as important </p>
<p>as specific expertise …” </p>
<p><b>92. </b> Sir Michael explained that salaries would be paid by employing departments. </p>
<p>Discussions were continuing on how other costs should be met. ORHA was expected </p>
<p>to provide accommodation. Staff would not be deployed until ORHA and Maj Gen Cross </p>
<p>were confident it was safe to do so. The “austere” living and working conditions would </p>
<p>be compensated by an allowance package being finalised by the FCO. </p>
<p><b>93. </b> On 25 April, FCO, DFID, MOD and Cabinet Office officials agreed a number of steps </p>
<p>to co&#8209;ordinate departments’ responses: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Dominick Chilcott, Head of the IPU, would lead a scoping visit to identify </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would pay salaries, additional allowances and transport costs to and </p>
<p>from theatre, on the assumption that ORHA would cover accommodation and </p>
<p>all other in&#8209;country costs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All departments would pay the salaries of their own staff. The MOD, DFID </p>
<p>and the FCO would pick up additional costs for their staff. Other departments’ </p>
<p>additional costs would be met through the allocation of a portion of the UK’s </p>
<p>reconstruction budget to the FCO (see Section 13.1).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>FCO security advisers would assess the security risk in Baghdad as soon  </p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IPU would inform ORHA that the UK understood that its secondees would </p>
<p>receive the same medical, evacuation and emergency response package as  </p>
<p>US staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A similar understanding would be needed “in due course” between the MOD and </p>
<p>other departments, covering Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) (MND(SE)).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO, DFID and the MOD would be responsible for recruiting their own staff. </p>
<p>The Cabinet Office, in liaison with IPU and DFID, would select staff put forward </p>
<p>by other departments.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO would arrange medical examinations and inoculations for secondees </p>
<p>and issue formal letters of appointment and terms and conditions.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>94. </b> The FCO informed No.10 on 25 April that members of the 20&#8209;strong UK contingent </p>
<p>with ORHA in Kuwait had arrived in Baghdad.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> It explained that 12 more civilian and </p>
<p>military secondees were expected to arrive in Baghdad by 5 May. Secondees’ roles </p>
<p>were still unclear, partly because of continuing uncertainty about ORHA’s own role. </p>
<p>The FCO was: </p>
<p>“… instructing them to take a flexible, pragmatic approach to their work, aiming </p>
<p>to be proactive in identifying how they can best add value in support of Coalition </p>
<p>Phase IV objectives. We are also requesting this first wave to report back with early </p>

<p><b>96. </b> On 6 May, Mr Straw announced to Parliament the appointment of Mr John Sawers </p>
<p>as the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq (see Section 9.1). Mr Straw </p>
<p>explained that:</p>
<p>“Mr Sawers will work alongside Chris Segar, head of the newly opened British Office </p>
<p>in Baghdad, particularly in relation to the political process and our work in the Office </p>
<p>of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance.” </p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that, although he was “the senior Brit on the </p>
<p>ground” he was not Ambassador Bremer’s deputy, nor was he in the line management </p>
<p>chain of ORHA or the CPA. Rather, he was a representative of the British Government </p>
<p>and so his role was one of “exerting influence rather than exercising power”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>98. </b> By 14 May, the UK had still not reached agreement with the US on ORHA support </p>
<p>for UK secondees.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> The IPU explained to Mr Straw that:</p>
<p>“Since ORHA deployed to Kuwait we have been trying to obtain assurances from the </p>
<p>Americans … about the precise terms on which our contribution is being provided. </p>
<p>So far, despite a good deal of pressing, we have not been successful …”</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Deployment of the additional secondees was delayed briefly by DFID concerns </p>
<p>about security.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> On 13 May, Mr Suma Chakrabarti, DFID Permanent Secretary, informed </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay that ORHA’s ‘Outline Brief for Potential International Partners’ did not </p>
<p>cover security issues adequately.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> The outline committed the US military to provide </p>
<p>overall security and evacuation arrangements, but “it does not set out any security </p>
<p>procedures or contingency plans, as we would normally require for any other UK mission </p>
<p>in any other country”.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> Mr Chakrabarti explained that the contractors forming the bulk of the DFID team </p>
<p>recruited in response to Sir Michael Jay’s request for staff on 22 April, and due to travel </p>
<p>to Iraq the next day, had said that their insurance cover would be invalid until there was </p>
<p>an adequate security plan. The existing DFID secondee to ORHA had therefore been </p>
<p>put on standby to withdraw if security arrangements were not resolved quickly, and the </p>
<p>first two additional secondees had been stood down. Mr Chakrabarti proposed to send </p>
<p>a DFID security team to Baghdad the next day and requested that an FCO security </p>
<p>adviser accompany them.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Sir Michael Jay responded the same day, after discussing the issue with the UK </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>considered the issue in Baghdad to be “protection rather than evacuation”. Sir Michael </p>
<p>was “willing to accept the judgement of those on the ground that the arrangements </p>
<p>in place adequately provide security for the military and civilian secondees already </p>
<p>in ORHA and the augmentees we will be deploying from today”. </p>
<p><b>103. </b> Sir Michael added:</p>
<p>“In briefing UK secondees … we have stressed that Baghdad is an insecure </p>
<p>environment and that security guidelines laid down by the US military must be </p>
<p>followed at all times … All secondees are deploying with a full suite of protective </p>
<p>equipment including body armour, helmets and personal NBC [nuclear, biological, </p>
<p>chemical] suits, and have been trained in their use by MOD.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Sir Michael agreed, however, that it would be helpful to have a more detailed plan, </p>
<p>“not least to meet the insurance requirements of contracted staff”. Depending on what </p>
<p>the DFID security team concluded, the FCO might take up the suggestion that their </p>
<p>work “form the basis for a security plan covering all UK secondees”. DFID and the FCO </p>
<p>should continue to liaise closely. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> The first joint FCO/DFID security visit took place at the end of June and is </p>
<p>addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Before the AHMGIR on 15 May, the IPU advised Mr Straw that:</p>
<p>“Security for our secondees is a key concern … The US military are committed to </p>
<p>providing ORHA’s overall security and evacuation arrangements … ORHA does not </p>
<p>yet have a detailed evacuation plan, but the advice from theatre is that the key issue </p>
<p>in Baghdad is protection rather than evacuation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Our own judgement, including that of Security Strategy Unit, has been to accept </p>
<p>the view of those on the ground … The UK civilians currently in ORHA … have told </p>
<p>us that they are content with the way the US arrangements work in practice … We </p>
<p>have therefore proceeded with the deployment of additional secondees, and the first </p>
<p>group of 22 departed for Iraq on 14 May.” </p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>107. </b> There is no record of the issue being discussed by the AHMGIR on 15 May.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>108. </b> In the Annotated Agenda for the 22 May AHMGIR, officials explained that  </p>

<p><b>109. </b> The AHMGIR was also informed that 61 UK officials had been seconded to ORHA, </p>
<p>five of them in Basra. Officials provided very basic information on the functions of 35 of </p>

<p>separate briefings for the visit. </p>

<p>Basra and was looking at additional areas to support.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>113. </b> The FCO advised that the UK now had 61 secondees in ORHA (including in </p>
<p>Basra), most of whom were working with Iraqi ministries.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> In Basra, the UK had </p>
<p>provided a Deputy to Mr Ole Olsen, the Danish Head of ORHA(South), and 10 other </p>
<p>secondees, and planned to send more. </p>
<p><b>114. </b> On 1 June, the Deputy to Ambassador Olsen reported that ORHA(South) had </p>
<p>21 staff (eight UK civilians, five UK military officers, five Danish civilians, two US military </p>
<p>officers and one Japanese civilian). Additional staff were arriving “in trickles” but were </p>
<p>mostly military officers and had been directed to ORHA(South) by 1 (UK) Div and </p>
<p>Maj Gen Cross. Those officers were useful as “stopgaps”, but ORHA(Baghdad) needed </p>
<p>to provide expert staff.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>115. </b> On 3 June, Mr Blair called for Whitehall to return to a “war footing” in Iraq to </p>
<p>avoid losing the peace (see Section 9.1).</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> He stated that the CPA lacked “grip and </p>
<p>organisation” rather than money or numbers of staff. The UK needed to “beef up” its </p>
<p>involvement and there needed to be “a strong civilian team in the South. In general, </p>
<p>there needed to be a much stronger civilian grip”. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> After the meeting, Baroness Amos, the International Development Secretary,  </p>

<p>77</p>
<p><b>118. </b> On 16 June, Ms Sally Keeble, who had been DFID Parliamentary Under Secretary </p>
<p>of State until earlier that month, raised with Mr Blair her concerns about DFID’s planning </p>
<p>and preparation for post&#8209;conflict Iraq and its performance since the invasion, including its </p>
<p>slow engagement with the CPA after Ms Short’s resignation in May (see Section 10.1).</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Rycroft told Mr Blair that: “From what DM [David Manning] and I have seen  </p>
<p>from here, Sally’s letter is accurate in highlighting DFID’s failure to pre&#8209;plan and to </p>
<p>engage with CPA.” </p>
<p>79</p>
<p> Mr Rycroft recommended that Sir Andrew Turnbull pursue the issue </p>
<p>with DFID.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> On 4 July, Mr Chakrabarti told Sir Andrew Turnbull: </p>
<p>“DFID support to CPA has grown dramatically; and continues to do so. In early </p>
<p>April when CPA (ORHA as was) moved to Baghdad, DFID had one official in CPA. </p>
<p>That has grown to 16 today split between Baghdad and Basra, and will rise upwards </p>
<p>of 30 over the coming weeks – some 30 percent of the total UK contingent … </p>
<p>“DFID secondees into CPA have been successful in work areas ranging from food </p>
<p>distribution to refugee returns. Their success is based on thorough groundwork done </p>
<p>beforehand to ensure they have substantive roles, the skill set they bring to their </p>

<p><b>122. </b> On 2 July, Baroness Amos advised Mr Blair that the CPA contained “too many </p>

<p>265</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Baroness Amos made a number of broad recommendations for enhancing the </p>
<p>UK contribution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“more UK people with political skills on the ground … Arabic speakers, with </p>
<p>knowledge of the region, to strengthen capacity in CPA(South) and CPA </p>
<p>Baghdad”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“strengthen the senior management” in CPA(South) and “provide other staff </p>
<p>as required”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>send “whatever additional staff are required with the right skill set to CPA </p>
<p>[in Baghdad]”.</p>
<p><b>124. </b> A week later, Ms Hewitt advised Mr Blair of the need “to ensure that we are </p>
<p>seconding sufficiently senior people to the CPA”.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> It was noticeable that the US was </p>
<p>sending more senior people than the UK. </p>
<p><b>125. </b> Ms Keeble told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… the numbers speak for themselves. I think there were two advisers embedded </p>
<p>with the military, two others in Kuwait, one in Washington with ORHA, as it was then, </p>
<p>one in Amman, one in Tehran, for a large part of the early stages of the action and, </p>
<p>by the time I left DFID, I think there were – I think I’m right in saying about nine in </p>
<p>Baghdad and six in Basra and presumably still one in Washington.</p>
<p>“… I think it is a matter of judgement as to whether that’s a large number or not. </p>
<p>I didn’t think it was a very large number.” </p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event who had served in Iraq in 2003 </p>
<p>and 2004 commented on the additional responsibilities of Occupation. Many felt that </p>
<p>Occupying Power status changed the nature of their job from simply working overseas </p>
<p>to carrying an immense responsibility to Iraqis to do what was needed to get Iraq </p>
<p>functioning. Many struggled to find defined roles and hold on to them in US&#8209;dominated </p>
<p>Iraqi ministries. They commented that it was often difficult to influence the US because </p>
<p>of the UK’s relative size and capacity.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> The skills and seniority of civilian staff deployed to Iraq are considered later in  </p>

<p><b>129. </b> In Cabinet on 19 June, Baroness Amos said that the uncertain security situation in </p>

<p><b>132. </b> Mr Peter Millett, Head of FCO Security Strategy Unit (SSU), set out the key </p>
<p>conclusions to Mr Collecott:</p>
<p>“We are failing to meet our duty of care to both FCO staff and those seconded </p>
<p>to CPA through the FCO. The security situation is extremely dangerous and the </p>
<p>CPA security resources are inadequate. The majority of secondees need to travel </p>
<p>outside the secure zone where the threat is high and there is little or no control of </p>
<p>the streets. The rules require secondees to travel in soft&#8209;skinned vehicles escorted </p>
<p>by US military vehicles. This makes them extremely vulnerable since the US military </p>
<p>are the target of daily attacks. The alternative to military escorts is a two&#8209;car convoy </p>
<p>with ‘shooters’, ie armed escorts. There are not enough military personnel, so UK </p>
<p>secondees are being asked to handle weapons, which does nothing to enhance </p>
<p>their security.” </p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Mr Millett listed the steps needed to allow CPA secondees to operate “effectively </p>
<p>and safely” in Baghdad:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a security manager in Iraq “to brief new arrivals, keep them up to date on </p>
<p>security incidents, manage security assets (vehicles, flak jackets etc) and act </p>
<p>as a focal point for communications”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a fleet of vehicles able to operate with or without US military escorts;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a team of armed escorts to accompany secondees outside the secure zone; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a radio communications system to allow secondees to stay in touch with the </p>
<p>security manager when outside the secure zone.</p>
<p><b>134. </b> Implementation of the package required:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreement on the detail with DFID, which was already introducing better </p>
<p>transport and equipment for its secondees;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a calculation of the number of journeys required each week and therefore the </p>
<p>number of vehicles and escorts needed;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>135. </b> Mr Millett described the situation in Basra as “different from Baghdad, partly </p>
<p>because of the political context in the South and partly because UK civilians are not </p>
<p>accompanied by military patrols”. The atmosphere was “more benign”, but could </p>
<p>deteriorate. Security in Basra was enhanced by “the active involvement of a DFID team </p>
<p>and a commercial contract that will provide armed guards and more vehicles”. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> Mr Collecott advised Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“We will inevitably be faced with some very difficult prioritisation decisions: activity </p>

<p><b>137. </b> Mr Chakrabarti had already set in hand the first of the recommended </p>

<p>Risks Group (CRG) to provide armed support to UK CPA secondees in Baghdad.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The contract had been let by DFID, in consultation with the FCO, with the intention of </p>
<p>drawing up a joint DFID/FCO contract for the longer term. Mr Chakrabarti also undertook </p>
<p>to send a first batch of “appropriate vehicles” and hand&#8209;held communications equipment </p>
<p>from DFID’s stockpile for use by UK staff in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>138. </b> In late June, DFID asked the MOD to provide a military close protection team for </p>
<p>DFID staff in Baghdad.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>139. </b> It its response on 17 July, the MOD explained that Royal Military Police (RMP) </p>
<p>close protection resources were “very heavily committed … in support of the FCO </p>
<p>presence in Baghdad and on other tasks elsewhere”. Steps had been taken to bring the </p>
<p>RMP commitment down to sustainable levels. That included a reduction in RMP support </p>
<p>for FCO staff, which would limit their freedom of movement in Baghdad. MOD Ministers </p>
<p>had agreed that the only way the RMP could provide resources to DFID staff would be </p>
<p>if DFID shared the resources available to the FCO:</p>
<p>“We recognise that this is far from ideal for you and is likely to further constrain </p>
<p>HMG’s [Her Majesty’s Government’s] diplomatic activity in Baghdad, but it may be </p>
<p>an improvement on your current arrangements.”</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Separately, the MOD informed DFID that medical procedures were being updated </p>
<p>to ensure that all UK civilians and contractors received the same standard of care </p>
<p>as those in the MOD, including evacuation to the UK or Germany as appropriate.</p>

<p>improve security for FCO staff and UK secondees to the CPA in Iraq.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> He advised </p>
<p>Mr Paul Boateng, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury: </p>
<p>“To meet our duty of care to staff, we need to provide armoured vehicles, </p>
<p>armed escorts and a communication system for UK civilian secondees to CPA. </p>
<p>This expenditure is unprecedented, unforeseen and cannot be funded by </p>

<p><b>143. </b> Mr Straw’s request and the Treasury response are addressed in more detail </p>
<p>in Section 13.1.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Secondments to the CPA should be maintained at “approximately the current </p>
<p>level”, but matched more closely to requirements, with more specialist than </p>
<p>policy staff.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secondments should be extended from three months to six.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ministers and Sir Andrew Turnbull should help identify and release suitable staff </p>
<p>from departments, including a senior oil expert and senior economist.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “effort” in CPA(South) should be increased “as required”, including </p>
<p>through the appointment of a “suitably strong UK figure” to replace  </p>
<p>Ambassador Olsen.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should continue to send small numbers of staff to other CPA  </p>

<p>its recommendations on the principle that the UK should seek to exert influence at </p>

<p>would also give the UK sight of developments across Iraq. </p>
<p><b>147. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the UK should shift emphasis over time from regional </p>

<p>97</p>
<p> There would </p>
<p>be “significant resource implications”. DFID had undertaken to fund the set&#8209;up costs </p>

<p>from sixteen different branches of government”, an exercise he described as having </p>
<p>“no modern precedent”:</p>
<p>“We now have 65 UK public servants working in the CPA Headquarters in Baghdad, </p>
<p>and nearly 30 in the CPA South&#8209;East Office in Basra … Small numbers are also </p>
<p>working in the CPA offices in central and northern Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Sir Michael reported that Ministers had decided the UK would maintain </p>
<p>“approximately the current level of overall commitment” with a focus in Baghdad on </p>
<p>SSR, the economic ministries and the oil sector, a “stronger lead” in CPA(South) and </p>
<p>leadership of four CPA GTs.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Sir Michael explained that the FCO had set up a liaison office in Baghdad </p>
<p>working to Mr Sawers and a CPA Operations Team (CPA&#8209;OT) in the IPU to put the </p>
<p>UK’s secondments on “a focused and sustainable basis, and provide secondees with </p>
<p>the appropriate support for service in what will remain a difficult and unpredictable </p>
<p>environment”. The CPA&#8209;OT would “debrief the first group of secondees as they return </p>
<p>to ensure we learn the right lessons from their experiences on the ground”. </p>
<p><b>154. </b> Sir Michael advised:</p>
<p>“We will continue to need to provide good human resources if the CPA is to succeed. </p>
<p>As reconstruction proceeds we expect more of this requirement to be met with staff </p>
<p>engaged under contract from outside HMG. But we will continue to have a need to </p>
<p>second staff with specialist skills from our own public service. The new machinery </p>
<p>in Baghdad and the IPU will enable us to match requirements and resources more </p>
<p>exactly.”</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Sir Michael wrote separately to Sir Nigel Crisp, Permanent Secretary at the </p>
<p>Department of Health (DoH), to thank the DoH team in Basra for its “major contribution </p>
<p>to the re&#8209;establishment of a functioning health system”, which had been “out of all </p>

<p><b>156. </b> Sir Michael also wrote to Sir Robin Young, Permanent Secretary at the Department </p>
<p>of Trade and Industry (DTI), who had raised concerns about security and staff salaries.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Michael explained that, after the assessment of security in Baghdad and Basra, the </p>
<p>FCO had taken urgent action that should allow it to fulfil its duty of care to staff. Working </p>
<p>and living conditions were also improving and were now “quite reasonable (and are </p>
<p>compensated by a good allowances package)”. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> On salaries, Sir Michael explained to Sir Robin Young that the terms under which </p>
<p>the FCO received funding from the Treasury for CPA deployments prevented it paying </p>
<p>the salaries of staff seconded from other departments. He hoped that “the priority given </p>

<p>103</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>160. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry what he found on arrival: </p>
<p>“A pretty dysfunctional team of eight to ten different nationalities, very, very few </p>
<p>British, three Foreign Office officials, one permanent DFID official and a lack of focus </p>
<p>and a lack of capability … The phones didn’t work, there were no mobile phones </p>
<p>at that time and nobody had thought to provide me with any form of computer.” </p>

<p><b>161. </b> The decision to appoint Sir Hilary as Head of CPA(South) and his experience on </p>
<p>arrival in Basra are addressed in more detail in Section 10.1.</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Shortly before Sir Hilary Synnott’s arrival in Basra, the CPA produced a ‘Vision for </p>
<p>Iraq’, supported by a detailed implementation plan (see Section 10.1).</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>163. </b> In his memoir, Sir Hilary wrote:</p>
<p>“The trouble was it [the ‘Vision for Iraq’] did not amount to an operational plan of </p>
<p>action … There were no indications about how in practice they would be achieved: </p>
<p>no details of funding, of personnel involved, of support systems or of timing.” </p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>164. </b> On 7 August, officials informed the AHMGIR that the IPU was debriefing the first </p>

<p>272</p>
<p><b>The impact of deteriorating security</b></p>
<p><b>167. </b> On 19 August, a bomb exploded outside the UN headquarters at the Canal Hotel </p>
<p>in Baghdad, killing 22 UN staff and visitors, including Mr Sérgio Vieira de Mello, the </p>
<p>UN Secretary&#8209;General’s Special Representative for Iraq (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> One </p>
<p>member of DFID staff was slightly injured.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>168. </b> Later the same day, Mr Benn held a meeting with officials to discuss next </p>
<p>steps and review the status of DFID staff in Iraq.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> Dr Nicola Brewer, DFID Director </p>
<p>General Regional Programmes, stated that it would be “unfortunate if DFID precipitated </p>
<p>a withdrawal of staff from Iraq”. The department should say publicly that it would </p>
<p>not be “intimidated” by terrorism, but any member of staff who wanted to leave </p>
<p>should be allowed to do so. Staff employed on contracts would need advice. If anyone </p>
<p>did want to leave, it would need to be co&#8209;ordinated across Whitehall and not perceived </p>
<p>as an evacuation. </p>
<p><b>169. </b> On the night of 19 August, the British Office Baghdad was evacuated to the CPA </p>
<p>secure zone after officials received a warning of a possible attack.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>170. </b> A second attack on the UN took place on 22 September.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Security also deteriorated in the South, with fuel and electricity riots taking place </p>
<p>in Basra during August (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>172. </b> In his memoir, Sir Hilary Synnott wrote that a “shortage of space and squalid living </p>
<p>conditions were affecting operations”, but, most importantly:</p>
<p>“… our combined offices and sleeping quarters were clearly unsafe. Although, in </p>
<p>those early days, there were no instances of suicide bombs, we were still vulnerable </p>
<p>to car bombs, rocket&#8209;propelled grenades, mortars, small&#8209;arms fire through our </p>
<p>windows, siege and sapping. The building adjoined town houses and was flanked </p>
<p>by roads on three sides, one of which was next to a canal. The only exit towards a </p>
<p>military safe&#8209;haven if we were attacked was over a single bridge, which could easily </p>
<p>be blocked by any assailants. We had to move.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I formally called for separate and independent security reviews by the CPA in </p>
<p>Baghdad and by the FCO in London, knowing that they could only agree on the </p>
<p>need for us to move.” </p>

<p>The immediate solution is to strengthen security measures in CPA(South) …  </p>
<p>Civilian staff also need to be provided with a large fleet of armoured vehicles: until </p>
<p>these arrive, which will take time, we need more assistance with escorting from the </p>
<p>military … Resources for security assets are an issue. But the principle should be </p>
<p>that we provide the number of security assets we need for people to do their jobs </p>
<p>properly, rather than limit the number of tasks we take on to the number of security </p>
<p>assets we have on the ground (as some around Whitehall have been suggesting). </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Officials also raised concern about “the unwillingness of US personnel [in </p>
<p>Baghdad] to discuss security arrangements … in detail”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> The UK would need to make </p>
<p>its own assessment of the national situation, potentially leading to UK staff being unable </p>
<p>to participate in certain CPA activities. The presence and security of UK staff sent to the </p>
<p>CPA would “need to be balanced against our responsibilities for the government and </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event who served in Iraq during the </p>
<p>CPA period commented that intelligence on threats and no&#8209;go areas should have been </p>
<p>disseminated to all civilians. They suggested that the UK had been better at this than </p>
<p>the US, but in Baghdad, where the US controlled security, there had been problems with </p>
<p>the flow of information.</p>
<p><b>180. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the recommendations in the DFID/FCO security review </p>
<p>should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>181. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry: </p>
<p><i>“</i>After the attack on the UN building at the end of August, the Spanish and Japanese </p>
<p>Governments ordered their civilians to leave. And on 30 August, of course, the </p>
<p>UN ordered their expatriates to leave also. Everybody else stayed. I was told by </p>
<p>London to draw up security regulations and to take disciplinary action if they were </p>
<p>not obeyed. I replied that I had already drawn up security instructions which we had </p>
<p>been testing, and as for taking disciplinary action, I reminded London that I actually </p>
<p>had no statutory authority, as far as I knew, over the nationals of another country.” </p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>182. </b> On 28 August, Mr Crompton informed Mr Straw that Sir Hilary Synnott had </p>
<p>requested 34 secondees for CPA(South).</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>183. </b> Later that day, the AHMGIR agreed, “subject to security concerns”, that: </p>
<p>“Hilary Synnott should be given such assistance and staff as he deemed necessary to </p>
<p>improve the workings of CPA South.” </p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>184. </b> Mr Crompton visited Iraq from 31 August to 3 September.</p>

<p> He concluded that </p>
<p>“the Coalition as a whole is only just beginning to come to terms with the scale of the </p>
<p>task”. The “general view” was that the job was “doable”, but the UK needed to “throw </p>
<p>massive resources at the problem now”. UK staffing in the South and the governorates </p>
<p>needed to increase significantly. The relationship between the two was “not yet clear”. </p>

<p>131</p>
<p><b>193. </b> At the Iraq Senior Officials Group (ISOG) on 23 September, Mr David Richmond, </p>
<p>the Prime Minister’s Deputy Special Representative on Iraq, reported that UK </p>
<p>“influence in CPA Baghdad is limited; we supply only 100 out of its 1,000 staff there”.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Richmond recommended that deployment of UK secondees be “continuously </p>
<p>reviewed so that they are where we most need them. The UK is still under&#8209;represented </p>
<p>at senior level; we should continue to seek senior posts as they become available.”</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I don’t think we asked for a lot more people. What we wanted was Arabic </p>
<p>speakers for obvious reasons, and we had Charles Heatley [CPA spokesman, see </p>
<p>Section 10.1] and his successor, both of whom were very good Arabic speakers, </p>
<p>but we probably could have done with more.” </p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Sir David also observed that “lack of continuity was a far greater problem than </p>
<p>a lack of skills”.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>196. </b> On 15 October, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) assessed that:</p>
<p>“The security situation remains difficult in central Iraq. The upward trend in the </p>
<p>number of attacks against the Coalition Forces (CF) shows no sign of abatement … </p>
<p>The vast majority of attacks (some 80 percent) occur in Baghdad and the </p>
<p>surrounding Sunni Arab areas … Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are the single </p>
<p>most common form of attack, some increasingly sophisticated, and we have also </p>
<p>seen more mortars being employed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The situation in the UK Area of Responsibility in the South remains relatively calm. </p>
<p>In the first week of October, out of 174 attacks against CF in Iraq, only four were </p>
<p>against troops in MND(SE). The mortar attack against the British base in Basra on  </p>
<p>8 October was a serious incident, but the trend continues to be a relatively low level </p>
<p>of attacks.” </p>
<p>135</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>197. </b> In early October, Sir Hilary Synnott reported “markedly improved attitudes </p>

<p>277</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry that there was a general impression of improvement in </p>
<p>Basra during October and November 2003.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>199. </b> In late 2003, a significant number of civilian vacancies in CPA(South) were filled </p>
<p>temporarily by the UK military, including by Reservists from the Territorial Army (TA). </p>
<p><b>200. </b> After a visit to Basra on 2 October, Mr Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the </p>
<p>Armed Forces, commented on the time it had taken to set up an effective CPA and the </p>
<p>“large number of gapped posts and military personnel doing jobs that should be done </p>
<p>by civilian volunteers”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>201. </b> On 13 October, Mr Ingram described to Mr Benn, who had replaced Baroness </p>
<p>Amos as Secretary of State for International Development on 5 October, the risks </p>
<p>involved in using military reservists to address “the precarious situation on CPA(S) </p>
<p>manpower”.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> Mr Ingram attached lists of the 48 military staff embedded in CPA(South) </p>
<p>and the CPA GTs in Basra, Maysan, Muthanna and Dhi Qar. A total of 35 were </p>
<p>Reservists, all but one of them due to leave Iraq by the end of 2003. </p>
<p><b>202. </b> Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secetary, raised the issue of Reservists with Mr Straw </p>
<p>on 23 October.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> The ad hoc filling of vacant posts by military personnel, including </p>
<p>Reservists who happened to have relevant skills from civilian life, was “not a robust way </p>
<p>to resource such an important body”. Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“… we need to get out of a mindset where the default position is to call on ‘spare’ </p>
<p>military personnel to fulfil roles for which they have not been trained. CPA(S) may </p>
<p>well require a higher proportion of civilians than the CPA elsewhere in the country </p>
<p>because the roles and capabilities of UK forces do not encompass all of those </p>
<p>available within the much larger US Armed Forces. We will, of course, continue to </p>
<p>support the overall effort in the South where we can, but the best people for the </p>
<p>posts in CPA(S) could well come from a wider range of Whitehall departments and </p>
<p>the civilian sector in the UK.”</p>
<p><b>203. </b> On 30 October, the MOD Iraq Secretariat briefed Mr Hoon on options for </p>
<p>compulsory mobilisation of volunteer reserves to fill CPA gaps.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> It advised that </p>
<p>Reservists’ willingness to take on those jobs was admirable, but it was unfair to employ </p>
<p>them in roles for which they had not originally volunteered and for less pay than they </p>
<p>would receive as civilians. Their transfer to civilian roles also represented an opportunity </p>
<p>cost to the military. </p>

<p><b>204. </b> The Iraq Secretariat recommended that the MOD wait to see the outcome of the </p>
<p>latest FCO/DFID recruitment drive, but also stand ready to provide what assistance </p>
<p>it could if that was unsuccessful. Numbers were unlikely to be large (“10s of people”). </p>
<p>The Iraq Secretariat stated that an effective CPA(South) was crucial to UK success in </p>
<p>the South: “<i>If other avenues have been exhausted</i> it may thus be in our interest to seek </p>
<p>Reservists to fill requirements.” </p>

<p> Sir Hilary Synnott wrote in his memoir:</p>
<p>“It was security which had driven the move and which had ensured that it happened </p>
<p>quickly, but it was the improved comfort which everyone appreciated the most.</p>
<p>“The difference in living conditions seemed almost unbelievable. Instead of  </p>
<p>sleeping in crowded rooms or on floors, with unspeakable sanitary arrangements </p>
<p>and virtually non&#8209;existent communications equipment, every staff member had their </p>
<p>own cabin … with a proper bed, a cupboard, a shower and lavatory, and even an </p>
<p>air&#8209;conditioning unit …</p>
<p>“Within another couple of weeks FCO engineers had installed a secure </p>
<p>communications system …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“At last, two&#8209;and&#8209;a&#8209;half months after my arrival, I was starting to muster the staff and </p>
<p>equipment which would enable me to do my job reasonably effectively. This support </p>
<p>was as nothing compared with the general’s [Major General Graeme Lamb, General </p>
<p>Officer Commanding (GOC) MND(SE)] staff, but it was something; and, of course, </p>
<p>our respective tasks were different.”</p>

<p> On 27 October, he sent a further request to the </p>
<p>FCO.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> He explained that his initial request for 37 staff had focused on “our top  </p>
<p>priority areas: infrastructure, finance, police and security”. It was now clear to him that </p>
<p>44 more staff were needed to cover “political reporting, governance issues and CPA(S) </p>
<p>internal support”. </p>

<p>continuity difficult at the best of times. Gaps between postings, as have happened </p>

<p>the board. Personnel management structures are needed for the replacement of </p>
<p>all UK personnel in CPA(S) well in advance of their departure for mission.</p>
<p>“Some other factors are relevant. 18 UK military personnel currently seconded to </p>
<p>CPA(S) will be drawn down to zero between now and 28 December. They will need </p>
<p>civilian replacements …”</p>
<p><b>209. </b> On 14 November, Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head of OD Sec, reported to </p>
<p>departments that 104 staff from eight countries were working in CPA(South).</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>largest contributors after the UK were Italy and Denmark. Of the 48 UK secondees, </p>
<p>30 were civilians and 18 military, half of them from the TA. Seven TA personnel were </p>
<p>in the process of being re&#8209;engaged on civilian contracts. </p>
<p><b>210. </b> Mr Bowen explained that DFID had contracted the Crown Agents in October to </p>
<p>recruit 37 staff: seven to replace Reservists and 30 for new posts. Recruitment had not </p>
<p>been easy, despite financial inducements:</p>
<p>“Successful candidates need to have the right technical skills, aptitude for building </p>
<p>Iraqi capacity and willingness to work in a difficult environment. When recruited, </p>
<p>candidates also need to undergo security training. The Crown Agents should </p>
<p>fill 15 of the 37 posts this month, including seven TA personnel who are being </p>
<p>re&#8209;engaged on civilian contracts. These seven TA posts will be vacant for two to </p>
<p>three weeks while the TA officers are demobilised and contracted by Crown Agents </p>
<p>… Up to five lesser priority posts are likely to remain more difficult to fill, but Crown </p>
<p>Agents are being pressed to locate suitable candidates as soon as possible …</p>
<p>“… Hilary Synnott subsequently asked FCO to fill a further 29 posts. These are in </p>
<p>the areas of interior and justice, liaison with the southern governorates, and in the </p>
<p>political development directorates. Job descriptions for these posts have now  </p>
<p>arrived from Basra … It should be possible to fill many of the jobs from Whitehall </p>
<p>(eg Home Office), although outside specialists may be necessary for some. There </p>
<p>is already a database of volunteers. But the security situation will be a deterrent. </p>
<p>Extracting people from current jobs, security training and the logistics of deployment </p>
<p>often take longer than we would want. But FCO aim to fill the posts during December </p>
<p>and January.</p>
<p>“CPA(South) has now grown substantially, and UK civilian staffing in Iraq as a </p>
<p>whole is moving towards the 200 mark. The number of civilians in CPA(South) </p>
<p>is larger than in other regions. But account must be taken of the fact that the large </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>211. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“One of my key requests was at the end of August when I asked for, I think,  </p>
<p>37 additional expert staff, not generalists but experts, and 20 armoured vehicles. </p>
<p>I was sent the record of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Committee [on 28 August], I think </p>
<p>within a day of this, and it was recorded there that Synnott should be provided  </p>
<p>with everything he thought was necessary. That, to my mind, clearly came from </p>
<p>No.10 and that was the pattern throughout. The difficulty, however, was turning </p>
<p>that political imperative into reality … I put in this bid at the end of August. The task </p>
<p>was ultimately given to DFID. I understood that in October they put out a trawl with </p>
<p>a deadline of, I think, the end of October for recruitment. By 1 January, 18 out of </p>
<p>37 had arrived.” </p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>212. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, DFID Iraq Director from September 2003 to December 2004, </p>
<p>described DFID’s role to the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Sir Hilary Synnott, working with us, identified, I think it was 37 posts that he wanted </p>
<p>to have filled, and we agreed to do that. </p>
<p>“We asked the Crown Agents to source those people from the market, because </p>
<p>we didn’t at that stage across government have a pool of people that could easily </p>
<p>be called upon, although the Iraq Planning Unit based in the Foreign Office had </p>
<p>managed to get quite a number of civil servants from Treasury, DFID and across </p>
<p>government into the CPA in the early days. But for Basra we were looking really to </p>
<p>fund from contractors in the market, partly because we were looking for specialist </p>
<p>skills in project implementation that we don’t necessarily have full&#8209;time in DFID.” </p>

<p><b>213. </b> Mr Drummond explained that some of the jobs were advertised across DFID, but </p>
<p>“mostly they were people who came from the market”. People had arrived in slightly </p>
<p>greater numbers after Christmas because those selected in December had asked for </p>
<p>their contracts to start on 1 January.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> During his farewell meeting with Mr Straw on 11 February 2004, Sir Hilary Synnott </p>
<p>said he had been frustrated at the length of time it had taken the FCO to deploy people </p>
<p>and provide secure communications. The FCO response had compared unfavourably </p>
<p>with that of other departments.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry that Whitehall departments’ interpretation of their duty  </p>
<p>of care towards civilian personnel had been an obstacle to the recruitment of the people </p>
<p>he needed:</p>
<p>“I raised it with the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, and we both of us thought that it </p>
<p>was a bit odd that our men and women in the armed forces could be exposed to risk. </p>
<p>But … we could not risk injury or death to civilians … </p>

<p>“I raised this with the Permanent Under Secretary [Sir Michael Jay] when I got back </p>
<p>and I was told that … the Permanent Under Secretaries’ Committee … were quite </p>
<p>adamant about this: it was an important duty and civilians were different from the </p>
<p>military … I think there was some concern about liability of being sued in the event </p>
<p>of injury or death.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“A side effect of this was that the interpretation varied within ministries, and there </p>
<p>was one occasion in early September 2003 when I discovered that I was short of </p>
<p>17 DFID personnel. They had gone away for a break and they had been stopped by </p>
<p>their managers from going beyond Kuwait on the grounds that conditions were too </p>
<p>dangerous in Basra. </p>
<p>“Now, we were living and working [in] Basra … The general who is the expert on </p>
<p>security had not been consulted, but the managers of DFID had decided that they </p>
<p>should not come back. I kicked up a bit of a stink and after quite some time they </p>
<p>were allowed back.” </p>

<p><b>216. </b> Efforts to co&#8209;ordinate departmental approaches to duty of care are addressed later </p>
<p>in this Section.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> Mr Buck advised Sir Michael Jay that the FCO record was not perfect, but the </p>
<p>department had “learned several lessons and gained valuable experience for the future”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Staffing of the FCO’s Iraq operation in London had been “hand to mouth  </p>
<p>from the start, and only recently received adequate strength, depth and </p>
<p>continuity”. A properly staffed unit needed to be formed as soon as it became </p>
<p>clear the FCO would have to manage a major new overseas deployment, and </p>
<p>the FCO needed to accept far more quickly that the requirement would remain </p>
<p>for the medium term.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In London and abroad, the FCO needed to be able to redirect staff “more swiftly </p>
<p>and flexibly” and to be able to target officers with suitable qualifications “more </p>
<p>systematically than HR records have allowed in the past”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “genuinely flexible” budget allocation along the lines provided for the military, </p>
<p>possibly controlled by the AHMGIR, would have saved time and energy and </p>
<p>prevented the Treasury playing one department off against another. “The only </p>
<p>area on which the Treasury have been genuinely helpful has been security.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the early stages DFID had not been “fully on side”. When it agreed to recruit </p>
<p>a large tranche of contractors, it had been slow to implement that commitment.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO had little previous experience of recruiting contractors, but now had </p>
<p>a pool of knowledge to draw from in future.</p>

<p>282</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Delays caused by duty of care obligations were “unavoidable”, but the Iraq </p>
<p>experience would help streamline the process in future.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Part of the problem in Basra had been uncertainty about what was needed and </p>
<p>“requests bounced about quite a bit. It would have made sense to have a senior </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict reconstruction expert in Basra working to Hilary Synnott, defining </p>
<p>needs from the outset.” </p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>218. </b> On communications equipment, Mr Buck explained that a secure communications </p>
<p>package and engineer had been deployed to the British Office Baghdad at the outset </p>
<p>and a full Firecrest</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> system had been ready to be shipped with the flat pack Embassy </p>
<p>in May. Firecrest systems were designed for a large network of posts. Because of the </p>
<p>changing set of posts in Iraq, installation in Baghdad and Basra had been delayed until </p>
<p>October. The delay had been a “major disadvantage” that made it “difficult for the FCO </p>
<p>to establish authoritative leadership”. Part of the answer lay in secure laptops. A new </p>
<p>position had been created “to co&#8209;ordinate and improve emergency deployment of secure </p>
<p>IT and communications”.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Mr Buck advised that most of those points had been fed into the FCO&#8209;led review </p>
<p>of post&#8209;conflict reconstruction (see Section 10.3). </p>
<p><b>220. </b> Sir Michael Jay commented:</p>
<p>“I agree with this. There are many lessons to learn from the – wholly unprecedented </p>
<p>– Iraq experience; but I don’t think Hilary Synnott’s criticisms are entirely fair.” </p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>221. </b> On 26 October, the al&#8209;Rashid Hotel in the Green Zone of Baghdad, used as a </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>222. </b> The attack killed a US soldier, and injured 15 other people. US Deputy Defense </p>

<p>158</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>228. </b> The al&#8209;Rashid Hotel bombing led to a review of protective security and  </p>

<p>of protective security within and beyond the Green Zone in Baghdad.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>230. </b> The preliminary report on 3 November recommended three areas for action: </p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>Improved ballistic protection for UK staff in their place of work and </p>
<p>accommodation. This action is required quickly as the threat is likely to worsen </p>
<p>in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>Improved passage of information and access to detailed threat assessments. </p>
<p>Current levels of information are poor and the CPA system for dissemination and </p>
<p>action in the aftermath of an incident is inadequate. Greater influence is required </p>
<p>from within the system.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>Consideration of future accommodation options with enhanced ballistic </p>
<p>protection. Favoured options will involve some cost and will need to be finessed </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>233. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald visited CPA(South) in early November.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> During the visit </p>
<p>a number of issues were raised by civilian secondees, including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Insufficient security support, limiting mobility of CPA staff (currently only eight </p>
<p>protected vehicles for over 60 staff requiring transport).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inadequate succession planning (the much praised DoH team particularly </p>
<p>complained of this).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Over&#8209;reliance on TA soldiers to perform specialist civilian jobs.”</p>
<p><b>234. </b> On 11 November, Sir Michael Jay advised Permanent Secretaries and the heads </p>
<p>of organisations with secondees in Iraq that the FCO was considering “on a contingency </p>
<p>basis – whether it would make sense to reduce the numbers of civilian staff if the </p>
<p>security situation were to deteriorate; and, if so, which staff we should retain in those </p>
<p>circumstances”.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>235. </b> Sir Michael reported that, in Baghdad, following the recommendations of the </p>
<p>review of accommodation after the al&#8209;Rashid Hotel bombing, the FCO was pursuing </p>
<p>urgently the possibility of constructing accommodation in the basement of the Green </p>
<p>Zone Convention Centre. The work could take two to three months, but the FCO was </p>
<p>pressing hard for it to be ready before Christmas. In the meantime it was looking at </p>
<p>interim arrangements. </p>
<p><b>236. </b> Sir Michael explained that, to ensure security measures were implemented </p>
<p>effectively and threat information disseminated promptly, the FCO had set up </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordination structures in London, Baghdad and Basra:</p>
<p>“The London Iraq Security Committee, chaired by the FCO, meets once a week with </p>
<p>a secure video link to Baghdad (to be joined by Basra when their video equipment </p>
<p>has been installed). Jeremy Greenstock chairs a UK security committee in Baghdad </p>
<p>which is linked into a wider CPA security committee. A similar committee is being set </p>
<p>up in Basra. Security issues are also discussed at Cabinet Office meetings including </p>
<p>COBR, the group of senior officials chaired by Nigel Sheinwald [ISOG] and the </p>
<p>Ad Hoc Ministerial Group [AHMGIR], which the Foreign Secretary chairs.”</p>
<p><b>237. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull and Mr Gus O’Donnell, Treasury Permanent Secretary, </p>
<p>discussed UK civilian secondees on 11 November. They agreed that there were roles </p>
<p>in the provisional administration in Iraq that would need to continue to be filled, but that </p>
<p>security must be tightened appropriately.</p>
<p>164</p>

<p>166</p>

<p>accommodation. Mr Straw advised Mr Boateng that the work would be completed in </p>
<p>January. In the meantime:</p>
<p>“… ad hoc accommodation for staff is extremely uncomfortable and unsatisfactory </p>

<p>“Following the attack on the al&#8209;Rashid Hotel, all other UK civilians in CPA Baghdad </p>
<p>are currently accommodated in trailer parks within the Secure Zone. The units now </p>
<p>benefit from physical security barriers which protect them against lateral bomb blast. </p>

<p>Some secondees who had left after the attack on the al&#8209;Rashid Hotel were returning, </p>
<p>but security was likely to get worse rather than better and required “constant vigilance”. </p>
<p>Communication from London to Baghdad and Basra, and with families in the UK,  </p>
<p>was important.</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Sir Michael Jay told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… some individuals … were rather more gung&#8209;ho and rather more prepared to </p>
<p>take risks … Some of the DFID people were rather less used than those of us in the </p>
<p>Foreign Office or elsewhere, to be working in very difficult conditions. These were </p>
<p>completely understandable differences and they never became serious issues, as </p>
<p>far as I’m aware … They were the sort of things that I discussed with the Permanent </p>
<p>Secretaries concerned, so that we reached agreement on the right approach.</p>
<p>“… I do remember one or two conversations when some departments were less </p>
<p>willing than others to go out into the field. I think that’s inevitable …</p>
<p>“You have got to have … duty of care at the top of the agenda and you have  </p>
<p>also sometimes got to say to people, ‘I know that you say you are willing to do that, </p>

<p><b>249. </b> The official explained that the FCO’s conversion of the ground floor of a car  </p>

<p> The total was likely </p>
<p>to rise above 200 in June, before falling after the transfer of sovereignty. Sir Michael </p>

<p>He described the spread of functions in Basra as “even wider”, given the UK’s “overall </p>

<p><b>254. </b> Sir Michael explained that the extra staff expected to deploy between January and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a DoH team for CPA(South) and the southern governorates;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“political process consultants”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>FCO staff setting up new diplomatic posts in Baghdad and Basra. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> Sir Michael anticipated that numbers should fall to between 70 and 80 after </p>
<p>the transfer of sovereignty, spread across the British Embassy Baghdad, the British </p>
<p>Embassy Office Basra and “possibly” other regional offices. He warned that FCO human </p>
<p>and financial resources were stretched, but concluded that plans for the next  </p>
<p>six months were “sensible – and manageable as long as the necessary resources  </p>
<p>are available”.</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Sir Michael Jay also updated Permanent Secretaries on security and duty of care </p>
<p>on 14 January:</p>
<p>“We would not normally deploy civilian staff to an area as dangerous as Iraq now is. </p>
<p>But Treasury Solicitors have confirmed to the Cabinet Office that we are complying </p>
<p>with our duty of care if (i) we take all reasonable measures to mitigate risk, at least </p>
<p>on a par with other governments, (ii) staff are volunteers, and we put no pressure </p>
<p>on them to take up posts in Iraq, and (iii) we deploy staff for good reason. We are </p>
<p>confident we are fulfilling these requirements.”</p>
<p><b>257. </b> On mitigation of the security risk, Sir Michael explained:</p>
<p>“The CPA itself is responsible for CPA staff security. But our guidelines and </p>
<p>additional security assets bring security for British staff up to levels which we believe </p>
<p>are required to allow staff to do their jobs while mitigating the risk to an acceptable </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>level. Most importantly, all British civilian staff are required to travel in armoured </p>
<p>vehicles and in convoy with armed protection teams … We have to be prepared for </p>
<p>the possibility of serious casualties: … people may just be in the wrong place at the </p>
<p>wrong time.”</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Sir Michael Jay visited Baghdad from 21 to 23 January. He told Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“There are some tensions on the ground, notably over security, particularly in </p>
<p>Baghdad: staff tend to put a greater premium on quality of life … than on security. </p>
<p>I believe Jeremy Greenstock’s maxim that no British staff should be killed by </p>
<p>a predictable attack is right.” </p>
<p>177</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>259. </b> On 18 February, Mr O’Donnell confirmed to Sir Jeremy Greenstock that, in light </p>
<p>of the assurances he had received, “Treasury secondees will be making their way back </p>
<p>to Iraq from the beginning of next week”.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Lord Jay told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Flying into Baghdad [in January 2004] in a Hercules which has got red blobs </p>
<p>on the radar screens saying ‘That’s where the missiles were fired the last time </p>
<p>round’ concentrates the mind a bit … These were not normal conditions. These </p>
<p>were, I thought, very brave, very able people from a wide range of government </p>
<p>departments doing a fantastic job in very, very difficult circumstances and you </p>
<p>come back thinking, ‘Gosh! You have really got to focus on their safety. It is hugely </p>
<p>important that they continue to do this job as well as they are doing it at the moment.’ </p>
<p>But you have got to have huge responsibility for their safety.” </p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>261. </b> A DFID security assessment of Baghdad and Basra in January 2004 found that:</p>
<p>“With many more armoured vehicles now in country, constraints on the movement of </p>
<p>staff have eased over the period but the CRG teams remain fully stretched.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Numbers </p>
<p>of British staff at both locations (Baghdad and Basra) continue to increase, and extra </p>
<p>armoured vehicles and Armed Protection Teams (APTs) are still urgently needed.” </p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>262. </b> On 26 January 2004, Mr Straw requested a further £9.4m from Mr Boateng: </p>
<p>“The firm judgement of our security experts is that, without the protection of </p>

<p>for our civilian staff to travel outside guarded CPA compounds such as the Green </p>

<p><b>263. </b> Mr Boateng agreed the FCO bid in full on 30 January.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>264. </b> By 21 April, the number of UK civilians seconded to the CPA had risen to about </p>
<p>260, with approximately 120 each in Baghdad and Basra, and 20 elsewhere in Iraq.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Between 70 and 80 MOD civil servants were directly supporting Op TELIC.</p>
<p><b>The British Offices in Baghdad and Basra</b></p>
<p><b>265. </b> During the CPA period, the expansion of the British Office Baghdad and the </p>
<p>opening of a British Office in Basra were delayed by the limited availability of security </p>
<p>assets and the need to prioritise other UK activities in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> The British Office Baghdad was opened by Mr Segar on 5 May 2003.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>267. </b> Originally staffed by a team of four, by late summer 2003 it had eight UK&#8209;based </p>
<p>staff and a locally employed British Council officer. The Commercial Section was staffed </p>
<p>by two UKTI officials and a secondee from industry.</p>
<p><b>268. </b> The flat pack Embassy arrived in Baghdad on 23 June in 80 containers. </p>
<p>It consisted of prefabricated office and accommodation units and was designed </p>
<p>to house up to 40 staff.</p>
<p><b>269. </b> On 18 July, in a letter to Mr Boateng requesting additional funds for security </p>
<p>enhancements to FCO posts in Iraq, described earlier in this Section, Mr Straw reported </p>
<p>that the British Office Baghdad was assembling the flat pack Embassy under 24&#8209;hour </p>
<p>sniper watch and would “soon be up to full strength of eight UK&#8209;based officers”.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>270. </b> On 5 August, FCO officials discussed proposals from Mr Segar to expand the </p>
<p>British Office Baghdad to 10 UK&#8209;based and 23 local staff.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> Mr Crompton informed </p>
<p>Mr Segar that availability of security assets was likely to be “a major constraint” on his </p>
<p>expansion plans: “further increases in armed protection teams, armoured cars and other </p>
<p>security equipment could only be funded through compensating savings elsewhere”. </p>
<p>He advised Mr Segar “to think carefully about prioritising”. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> On 19 August, after the bombing of the Canal Hotel, the British Office Baghdad </p>
<p>was moved from the former British Embassy compound to a villa in the CPA  </p>
<p>secure zone.</p>

<p>188</p>
<p> There were also “many opportunities for TPUK and </p>
<p>British Council”, but expansion plans should be “moderated to match the availability of </p>
<p>accommodation and security assets”. </p>
<p><b>273. </b> Further work appears to have halted until early 2004, when the FCO created </p>
<p>a project management team in London, with project managers in Baghdad and Basra, </p>
<p>to plan the UK’s post&#8209;CPA representation in Iraq.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> The planning process is addressed </p>
<p>later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>274. </b> In November 2003, the IPU reported that work on the flat pack Embassy had </p>
<p>stopped and that it would shortly be secured and waterproofed “until the security </p>
<p>situation is more permissive and work can continue”.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>275. </b> In July 2003, the FCO put on hold plans to open a British Office in Basra by </p>

<p>191</p>
<p> Any staff already </p>

<p>192</p>
<p> The IPU recommended a total </p>
<p>of six UK&#8209;based staff, including one from TPUK, and an unspecified number of local </p>
<p>staff. DFID and the British Council were reported to have indicated an interest in having </p>
<p>one representative each.</p>

<p><b>278. </b> A decision on whether to open a British Office in Mosul was postponed.</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Julian Metcalfe, Head of FCO Estate Strategy Unit, informed Mr Collecott on </p>
<p>30 July that efforts to identify premises for the British Office in Basra were “turning into </p>

<p><b>280. </b> Two FCO officials visited Basra to identify a suitable location on 30 July, 24 hours </p>
<p>after Sir Hilary Synnott’s arrival as the new Head of CPA(South).</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> They reported that </p>
<p>Sir Hilary had been very helpful, but that, in the absence of FCO staff able to facilitate </p>
<p>the visit, it had “bordered on farce at times”. Initially they had been told there was no </p>
<p>transport or protection available for a tour of the city, but the visit was “saved at the </p>
<p>eleventh hour from being a total disaster” by the MND(SE) visits officer and MOD/</p>
<p>CPA liaison officer. The officials did not reach firm conclusions on a location and </p>
<p>recommended “a more structured visit” soon.</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott advised the FCO that December was not soon enough to </p>
<p>establish a bilateral presence in Basra.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> Commercial, visa and consular demands were </p>
<p>all increasing. Much as he would like to help, CPA(South) did not have the capacity or </p>
<p>the mandate to do so. He therefore recommended the early creation of a small “UK </p>
<p>bilateral cell” in Basra. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> Mr Straw submitted a claim on the Reserve to cover the expected cost of setting </p>
<p>up and running the Basra Office in his letter to Mr Boateng on 18 July.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>283. </b> Mr Boateng rejected Mr Straw’s claim on 9 September, explaining that he “would </p>
<p>have expected the FCO to have adjusted their internal Resource Allocation Round at the </p>
<p>end of last year” when faced with what was an “increasingly likely” contingency.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>284. </b> In November 2003, Sir Nigel Sheinwald advised Mr Blair that the idea of a bilateral </p>
<p>UK office in Basra to handle “trade contacts, culture and visitors … fell by the wayside in </p>
<p>the summer” and needed to be revived.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Mr Blair asked for the FCO to “put in place a British Office in Basra to handle trade </p>
<p>contacts, cultural ties, visitors etc”.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>286. </b> The IPU advised Mr Straw that there would be advantage in revisiting the idea </p>
<p>of setting up a small unit in Basra for bilateral work, arranging visits and managing the </p>
<p>establishment of a post&#8209;CPA British Office, “not least to flag up the resource implications </p>
<p>to No.10”.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> Costs could be kept to a minimum by using staff already selected for </p>
<p>other roles and providing accommodation on the CPA(South) site. Other Whitehall </p>

<p>would oversee the establishment of a substantive “British Transitional Office”. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> Mr Hogger explained on 2 January 2004 that there was “little to report yet on </p>

<p> He hoped that a visit by security experts in January would make progress </p>

<p>to shift, and the rush began to prepare Iraq’s government to stand on its own in </p>
<p>seven months.” </p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>291. </b> On 5 December, Sir Hilary Synnott advised the FCO that the compressed timetable </p>
<p>made adequate staffing more important than ever. Recruitment needed to look beyond </p>
<p>the dissolution of the CPA. The UK would need to sustain “an intensive development </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation/technical assistance relationship” with Iraq and “might usefully maintain </p>
<p>an international co&#8209;ordination role. This will require a careful transitional process with </p>

<p><b>296. </b> The expectation was that it should be possible to reduce UK representation as  </p>
<p>Iraq stabilised.</p>
<p><b>297. </b> The paper stated that office infrastructure and key staff should be in place by </p>
<p>the end of June. Recruitment of staff and development of sites would begin as soon </p>
<p>as agreement had been reached with the US on a number of issues, including the </p>
<p>use of potential sites. The plan was to recruit staff for one year if possible, six months </p>
<p>renewable if necessary. Recruitment would not be easy. As one incentive, the FCO </p>
<p>planned to give staff the option of having their families in Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>298. </b> The paper also stated that the FCO had created a project management team </p>
<p>in London, which had set up a cross&#8209;Whitehall Transition Project Management Group </p>
<p>including representatives of interested government departments. An FCO officer had </p>
<p>been seconded to the State Department transition team and a UK civilian was a member </p>
<p>of the CPA Transition Team.</p>

<p>Iraq to Sir Andrew Turnbull and Permanent Secretaries on 21 April 2004.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> There were </p>
<p>two categories of civilian employee: MOD civilians deployed as part of Op TELIC, and </p>
<p>other staff and contractors, either seconded to the CPA or deployed directly to Iraq, </p>
<p>who were “under the wing of IraqRep”. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> Sir Kevin explained:</p>
<p>“… the 70&#8209;80 MOD civil servants deployed at any one time in direct support of </p>
<p>Operation TELIC effectively enjoy the same protection as the military, alongside </p>
<p>whom they live and work. They would be unlikely to have to leave, but if they were, </p>
<p>the arrangements would be made through the Permanent Joint Headquarters </p>
<p>which is part of their reporting chain and also ‘owns’ the military transport assets. </p>
<p>This would be fairly straightforward given the numbers involved.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>“Of the IraqRep staff (including civil servants and contractors) there are about </p>
<p>120 each in Baghdad and Basra and 20 or so in smaller locations. Most are based in </p>
<p>secure locations which are currently protected by Coalition Armed Forces. Protection </p>
<p>whilst on the move is normally provided by private contractors. The security </p>
<p>guidelines for these staff is constantly under review, based on risk assessment done </p>
<p>by full time FCO security managers in Baghdad and Basra. Staff understand that </p>
<p>they are volunteers and that they may return to the UK if not comfortable with the </p>
<p>security arrangements.</p>
<p>“In the event that HMG civilians had to be withdrawn from the South, the UK Armed </p>
<p>Forces would assist with the evacuation of UK staff, through Basra Airport, by </p>
<p>road to Kuwait, or by sea, depending on the operational circumstances. Those in </p>
<p>Baghdad would be assisted to leave through the airport. In the outlying areas the </p>
<p>US military would assist. Detailed contingency plans are being drawn up.”</p>
<p><b>301. </b> Sir Kevin also commented on concerns expressed by Permanent Secretaries that </p>
<p>the withdrawal of civilian contractors could undermine the reconstruction effort:</p>
<p>“The impact on reconstruction would indeed be serious if contractors began to </p>
<p>withdraw, although there is little evidence that this is happening on a large scale. </p>
<p>Most companies seem to realise that they must balance their desire to participate </p>
<p>in [the] reconstruction effort with the need to look after their staff. Many are </p>
<p>reassessing their security arrangements, but look likely to remain … No UK or US </p>
<p>funded contractor has withdrawn from Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>302. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR on 22 April advised that security had </p>
<p>deteriorated “markedly” over Easter (9 to 12 April) and that the risks to UK civilian staff in </p>
<p>Iraq were “high”.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> The deployment of civilians had been reviewed and, as a temporary </p>
<p>measure, new deployments to Baghdad had been suspended and staff unable operate </p>
<p>in the current security environment had been withdrawn. </p>
<p><b>303. </b> The AHMGIR approved the recommendation that all other staff should remain in </p>
<p>Iraq subject to continuing review.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>304. </b> The 11 May meeting of ISOG discussed a concern raised by Mr Patrick Nixon, </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott’s successor as Head of CPA(South), that there would be a gap in </p>
<p>reconstruction activity in the South between the end of the CPA and the launch of major </p>
<p>infrastructure projects in August.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> The number of UK reconstruction staff would fall from </p>
<p>51 to seven (see Section 10.1).</p>

<p><b>306. </b> Mr Parham reported that, in Baghdad, all staff were accommodated under </p>
<p>hard cover, very few road journeys were authorised beyond Baghdad and there was </p>
<p>heightened concern about the road between Baghdad Airport and the Green Zone. </p>
<p>There was no operational alternative to using the airport road and staff would continue to </p>
<p>use it while mitigating risks as far as possible. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> Security in Basra had deteriorated over the previous two months. Staff were </p>
<p>accommodated in soft&#8209;skinned CPA trailers, which were being sandbagged to give </p>
<p>extra blast protection. Progress had been very slow, but was now being expedited. From </p>
<p>30 June, all staff at the British Embassy Office Basra would be under hard cover. </p>
<p><b>308. </b> Mr Parham explained that the drawdown of CPA(South) staff would begin in early </p>
<p>June as transition approached and that DFID was considering whether to bring forward </p>
<p>the departure of experts performing non&#8209;essential tasks. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> Mr Parham also reported on the security of UK staff in other provinces:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In Nasiriyah, Mr Rory Stewart, Deputy Governorate Co&#8209;ordinator, had already </p>
<p>been evacuated with the Co&#8209;ordinator and the CRG close protection team on </p>
<p>17 May after the CPA compound had come under sustained attack. Mr Parham </p>
<p>explained that it would not make sense for civilian staff to return to the </p>
<p>CPA office. Instead, a core staff might operate from the Italian military base </p>
<p>“as security allows”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Nixon and the Basra Security Manager would visit Samawah, the capital </p>
<p>of Muthanna province, on 19 May to assess whether the Deputy Governorate </p>
<p>Co&#8209;ordinator, the only UK member of the GT, should remain there. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The GT for Wasit province, headed by Mr Mark Etherington, was confined to </p>
<p>the city of Kut, where US troops were securing the CPA compound. Mr Parham </p>
<p>advised that the UK would pull out its staff if US troops withdrew. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The GT in Kirkuk was “securely established in a well&#8209;protected compound”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In Erbil, Dr Liane Saunders, CPA Regional Co&#8209;ordinator, was based in an </p>
<p>isolated compound that was “very secure and well&#8209;guarded”. She was able </p>
<p>to operate over a wide area.</p>
<p><b>310. </b> On 24 May, two UK civilians, an adviser to the Iraqi Oil Ministry employed by the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>against remotely controlled IEDs, which had been on order for “some time” and were </p>
<p>now urgent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>313. </b> IED counter&#8209;measures are described in more detail in Section 14.1.</p>
<p><b>314. </b> On 27 May, Mr Stuart Jack, Mr Parham’s successor as Head of the IOU, advised </p>
<p>Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“… we are currently at the limit of technical measures we can apply to protect </p>
<p>staff in Iraq. They have armoured cars and armed protection … All staff have body </p>
<p>armour and helmets. Everyone in Baghdad now sleeps under hard cover … security </p>
<p>managers are constantly reviewing the threat and apply the security guidelines </p>
<p>robustly; if travel becomes too dangerous, staff are required to remain in the </p>
<p>secure zone. It would be difficult to do much more and still allow staff to carry out </p>
<p>their jobs.” </p>
<p>214</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>315. </b> Mr Jack identified three options for “further minimising” risk to staff:</p>
<p> “(i)  We could bring forward departure dates for those staff scheduled to leave </p>
<p>in June, as DFID are planning.</p>
<p> (ii)  We could delay the deployment of new staff going out to fill jobs at the </p>
<p>Embassy.</p>
<p> (iii)  We could reduce our presence in Baghdad.” </p>
<p><b>316. </b> FCO security advisers visited Baghdad and Basra again from 14 to 20 June. </p>
<p>Mr Millett reported that the threat was higher than on the advisers’ previous five visits. </p>
<p>Security within the secure zones was good, but transport security remained the main </p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> He stated: </p>
<p>“<b>We have now reached the limit of what we can do to protect staff in Iraq </b>…  </p>
<p>[I]f the numbers of attacks increase further, we have nowhere else to go …</p>
<p>“We must ensure the numbers of staff are kept as low as possible consistent with </p>
<p>achieving our strategic objectives in Iraq. We also have to ensure that we keep </p>
<p>the contingency plan up&#8209;to&#8209;date for evacuation by the US and/or UK military.”</p>
<p><b>317. </b> Mr Richmond reported on 17 June that the threat to staff in Baghdad was at its </p>
<p>highest level since April 2003.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> Journeys outside the Green Zone were only being </p>
<p>approved under exceptional circumstances, seriously handicapping operational capacity </p>
<p>(although work to support the Prime Minister’s Office and some other programmes were </p>
<p>continuing). He had asked all staff who were not staying beyond 30 June to leave by  </p>
<p>21 June.</p>

<p><b>318. </b> Participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event commented that, although </p>
<p>it was difficult to arrange travel to meetings outside the Green Zone in Baghdad </p>
<p>from mid&#8209;2004, it was equally difficult for Iraqis to attend meetings inside the Green </p>
<p>Zone. Iraqis did so at significant personal risk and did not understand why their UK </p>

<p>conditions prevailed in Basra from mid&#8209;2006. </p>
<p><b>319. </b> In March 2004, Mr Jack completed a review of the FCO’s worldwide security </p>

<p> The terms of reference were: “To review the basis for the </p>
<p>FCO Security Strategy. In particular to re&#8209;examine the balance between security and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>“Should DFID’s employees be in Iraq at all, given current circumstances? The </p>
<p>answer is that DFID is free to employ its employees on work which will expose them </p>
<p>to unavoidable risk of injury or death (ie against which it cannot guard by taking </p>
<p>precautions); and, in the absence of express stipulation to the contrary, the risk is </p>
<p>held to be with them and not with DFID. The law, however, requires DFID to use all </p>
<p>reasonable care to diminish any inherent dangers, if it cannot eliminate these; and, </p>
<p>if (as I presume to be the case here) it cannot effectively eliminate the dangers </p>
<p>so that significant risks remain, it may be required to give its employees such </p>
<p>information which is available to it to help them evaluate properly the benefits of </p>
<p>being in Iraq against the risks. However, such a duty is more likely to arise where </p>
<p>the risks are <i>not</i> common knowledge (which I would say they probably are here).</p>
<p>“DFID is not legally obliged to provide staff of consultancy organisations with the </p>
<p>same level of support as it gives its own employees. Nor is it required by law to </p>
<p>underwrite the steps taken by NGOs to support their staff working in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>323. </b> On 29 July, Treasury Solicitors added that DFID should “consider carrying out </p>
<p>formal, periodic risk assessments as a further safeguard, and amending advice and </p>
<p>procedures as a result of any relevant risks identified”.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>324. </b> The first version of the DFID guidance on duty of care seen by the Inquiry is dated </p>
<p>January 2005.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“DFID has a responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect its employees </p>
<p>from risk of injury (physical, psychological) or death … DFID does not guarantee </p>
<p>that an employee will not be injured … In taking reasonable care, DFID will only be </p>
<p>liable if there is some lack of care on its part for failing to prevent something that was </p>
<p>reasonably foreseeable …</p>
<p>“All employees have a duty to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any risks to their </p>
<p>safety and security to which they are exposed …</p>
<p>“All UK&#8209;based DFID staff visiting or working in Iraq are volunteers and are under no </p>
<p>obligation to travel to Iraq and can leave Iraq at any time without penalty …”</p>
<p><b>325. </b> On the question of DFID’s obligations to non&#8209;DFID staff, the guidance stated:</p>
<p>“Individual consultants are not the employees of DFID and are ultimately responsible </p>
<p>for their own well&#8209;being and security arrangements … However, bearing in mind </p>
<p>the prevailing security conditions and difficulty of working in Iraq, DFID aims to </p>
<p>provide solo and singleton consultants with the same levels of security, logistical </p>
<p>and counselling support as it does its own staff …</p>

<p><b>The post&#8209;CPA UK civilian presence in Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>326. </b> On 1 July 2004, officials informed the AHMGIR that the British Embassy Baghdad </p>
<p>and “Consulates” in Basra and Kirkuk had started operating.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> Baghdad was reported </p>
<p>to have 75 staff, Basra 47 and Kirkuk three.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>327. </b> The FCO predicted that numbers in Baghdad would grow to “around 100 UK staff, </p>
<p>of whom over half will be consultants to Iraqi ministries and advisers on Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform”.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> The British Embassy Office Basra would consist of “around 80 UK&#8209;based </p>
<p>staff, of whom around 60 will be consultants and security sector advisers”.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event told the Inquiry that those </p>
<p>arriving in mid&#8209;2004 felt a clear disconnect between the CPA, whose staff were shutting </p>
<p>up shop and anxious to be home, and what followed. Knowledge acquired by CPA </p>
<p>personnel was not passed on and commercial rivalry between old and new contractors </p>
<p>damaged continuity. </p>

<p> He added:</p>
<p>“As we prepare to move beyond the bare essentials of an office, a secure perimeter, </p>
<p>accommodation in hardened containers and a canteen – none yet fully in place – our </p>
<p>duty of care requires that, after security, morale must be a high priority. Access to </p>
<p>social amenities is currently less than any post I have seen …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Rapid staff turnover (the tour cycle, with breather visits, leaves only five months </p>
<p>in post before moving on) means there is a lack of institutional memory. And as yet </p>
<p>there is no cadre of experienced local staff to provide continuity …</p>

<p>to tackle any of the other constraints.” </p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>332. </b> On 5 August, Mr Collis reported that the detention on 3 August of four members of </p>

<p>We need to review constantly the number of staff in both posts to ensure that </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>342. </b> Officials reviewed the situation against contingencies that would trigger a reduction </p>
<p>in the numbers of staff exposed to the threat:</p>
<p>“In Baghdad: a deterioration in security within the International Zone; a redrawing </p>
<p>of its perimeter to place the Embassy at its edge …; an increase of accurate strikes </p>
<p>from rockets or mortars; loss of control of the airport road; or a CBW threat.</p>
<p>“In Basra: use of SAMS [surface&#8209;to&#8209;air missiles] in a manner that removed the </p>
<p>scope for evacuation by air; an increase of accurate mortar or rocket strikes; more </p>
<p>sophisticated attacks on vehicles; or a CBW threat.”</p>
<p><b>343. </b> Officials concluded that, in Basra, a rocket attack on the British Embassy Office </p>
<p>had triggered one of the contingencies. In consultation with other departments, the FCO </p>
<p>had initiated a limited withdrawal of less essential staff and DFID had postponed several </p>
<p>new deployments, largely because proposed work in the governorates was not possible </p>
<p>in current circumstances. </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Officials reported that, in Baghdad, the contingencies had not been triggered, but </p>
<p>the Embassy was reviewing staffing levels. DFID had reviewed its staffing in Baghdad </p>
<p>and planned a net reduction of six consultancy posts. Some work would be based </p>
<p>outside Iraq with shorter visits to Baghdad, but core work with the Iraqi Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>Office and on economic reform and support to civil society would not be affected. </p>
<p><b>345. </b> An easing of the security situation in Basra during November came to an end </p>
<p>with a rocket attack on the Basra Palace site on 4 December.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> Mr Collis reported that </p>
<p>staff had reverted to carrying body armour when moving outside after dark, but that the </p>
<p>Consulate Club, which had been housed in a portakabin, had reopened in a hardened </p>
<p>location on 5 December. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Further low intensity and inaccurate attacks continued throughout December.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p><b>347. </b> During 2004 and 2005, UK civilian personnel in Iraq became increasingly </p>
<p>dependent on military assets for transport between and within Baghdad and Basra. </p>
<p><b>348. </b> On 27 November 2004, after a series of attacks on the road to Baghdad Airport, </p>
<p>the US Embassy announced the suspension all road travel to the airport by civilian </p>
<p>staff.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> Until further notice, they would travel by helicopter.</p>
<p><b>349. </b> Mr Chaplin advised the FCO that the removal of US civilian vehicles from the </p>
<p>airport road would raise the threat to UK road travel to an unacceptable level. US </p>
<p>helicopters had no spare capacity and UK helicopters were committed to military </p>
<p>operations. For the Embassy’s operations to be sustainable, it needed its own </p>
<p>helicopter assets.</p>

<p> Security arrangements at both posts were reported to be “first class”. </p>
<p>All staff were said to have confidence in the security arrangements, which allowed them </p>
<p>“to work with a reasonably comfortable feeling in a very hostile environment”. Two issues </p>
<p>were highlighted:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A continuing shortage in Baghdad and Basra of ECMs for preventing remote </p>
<p>detonation of IEDs. Additional suites of ECMs had been ordered, but more were </p>
<p>needed. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A substantial reinforcement of US patrolling along the Baghdad Airport  </p>
<p>road since the beginning of 2005. If the number of incidents along the road </p>
<p>remained low, the British Embassy might be able to re&#8209;assess whether it could </p>
<p>be used again. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> In May 2005, in his valedictory as Head of the IPU, Mr Crompton advised:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>357. </b> On 15 July, the Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) considered a draft paper to be </p>
<p>signed by Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, on operational transition in Iraq </p>
<p>(see Section 9.4).</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>358. </b> The paper described a process in which Iraqi Security Forces would take  </p>
<p>primacy province by province. The transfer would be implemented from October in </p>
<p>Maysan and Muthanna provinces. Basra and Dhi Qar would follow in spring 2006. </p>
<p>This would lead to a reduced profile for UK forces, and reductions in numbers to </p>
<p>around 3,000 by summer 2006. </p>
<p><b>359. </b> After a discussion, the ISG concluded that the paper needed to cover more clearly </p>
<p>the implications for other government departments and international actors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>360. </b> In the revised paper, sent to No.10 on 18 July, Dr Reid stated that the drawdown </p>
<p>could have an impact on the broader UK and international effort in the South:</p>
<p>“It is also possible that other (FCO and DFID) activity in Iraq aimed at developing </p>
<p>the Iraqi police service and reconstruction will need to be curtailed or reduced, with </p>
<p>consequent implications for HMG’s wider effort, because of the difficulties of running </p>
<p>projects without UK military support and protection. This will need to be looked at </p>
<p>in more detail with Other Government Departments.” </p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Dr Reid’s paper also recognised that, although the drawdown was likely to deliver </p>
<p>a significant cost saving to the military, there could be an increase in costs for others:</p>
<p>“Other Government Departments operating in Iraq may … face increased security </p>
<p>costs as they are forced to seek commercial alternatives to military force protection.”</p>
<p><b>362. </b> The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy Sub&#8209;Committee on </p>
<p>Iraq (DOP(I)) agreed Dr Reid’s recommendation on 21 July.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>363. </b> On 16 September, the IPU advised Mr Straw and Sir Michael Jay that the </p>
<p>frequency and sophistication of attacks in Basra were increasing and the British </p>
<p>Embassy Office was locked down.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> The threat was greater than in autumn 2004. </p>
<p>The IPU recommended that the number of staff be kept under review and that </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay press the MOD for a dedicated helicopter service. </p>
<p><b>364. </b> Officials prepared a draft paper for DOP(I) on 27 September advising that civilian </p>
<p>activity in the South was “heavily reliant on UK forces for a range of services”, such as </p>
<p>accommodation outside Basra, helicopter transport and regular intelligence on security </p>

<p> Those services could be sourced from private contractors after the military </p>
<p>drawdown, though at a lower “level of service” and with increased risk to civilian staff. </p>
<p>The UK had spent £19.2m on life support (including £16m on security) in 2004/05. The </p>
<p>cost to source those services from private contractors would be at last 80 percent higher.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> On 29 September, after a further IED attack on a US convoy travelling on a route </p>
<p>being considered by the British Embassy Office Basra for road transfers to Kuwait,  </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay agreed to the temporary withdrawal of five FCO and contracted staff </p>
<p>from Basra.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>366. </b> On 30 September, Mr Straw’s Private Office sent No.10 joint FCO/MOD/DFID </p>
<p>advice on the implications for UK policy of the 17 September “Jameat incident”, when </p>
<p>two UK soldiers in Basra killed one Iraqi police officer and wounded another, and were </p>
<p>detained by the Iraqi authorities (see Section 9.4).</p>
<p>255</p>
<p> Mr Straw’s Office advised that </p>
<p>paper had been agreed by officials, but had not yet been seen by Mr Straw. The joint </p>
<p>paper stated:</p>
<p>“For FCO, DFID and OGD personnel to operate out of Basra will … require an air </p>
<p>bridge (similar to the one in Baghdad) from the Consulate General to Basra airport.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“<b>We will need to allocate more resources, which might include military </b></p>
<p><b>resources, to security. </b>The next week, and possibly months, are likely to be rough. </p>
<p>Attacks on us are becoming more sophisticated. We will need to protect our staff.”</p>
<p><b>367. </b> A manuscript comment by a No.10 official on an advance copy of the paper  </p>

<p><b>371. </b> The FCO SOSA visited Kirkuk, Baghdad and Basra between 10 and  </p>

<p> He reported that:</p>
<p>“The number of terrorist attacks remains at a high level and continues to be well </p>
<p>targeted and professional. The main threat to our staff in Baghdad and Basra is </p>
<p>from Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs). However, all methods of Vehicle Borne </p>
<p>Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs) can be expected in all areas in which our </p>
<p>staff operate. Indirect fire attacks are a threat to all our bases and the threat [of] </p>
<p>kidnap is high.</p>
<p>“The Security Managers and CRG are to be congratulated on their professional </p>
<p>control of road movement … It is clear that all road moves are subject to risk. </p>
<p>The completion of accommodation at the police academies and at the airports in </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra will allow more flexibility. The use of helicopters is vital in order </p>
<p>to change the pattern of movements.</p>
<p>“We recommend that all staff in Basra can move in Warrior armoured vehicles.”</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Growing pressure on military assets created tension between civilian and  </p>

<p><b>373. </b> Assistant Chief Constable (ACC) Colin Smith, the UK’s Chief Police Adviser in </p>

<p>that duty of care for civilians in Iraq, including police, was addressed on a collective </p>
<p>basis in Whitehall and that he only had to intervene twice: to allow police training officers </p>
<p>to remain overnight at their training centre; and to prohibit police officers from being </p>
<p>transported in UK military Snatch Land Rovers.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> He insisted that they be transported </p>

<p><b>375. </b> Protected mobility is addressed in more detail in Section 12.1.</p>
<p><b>376. </b> On 16 December, DFID officials recommended to Mr Benn a number of changes </p>
<p>to transport arrangements in Basra, including use of Warrior armoured vehicles by </p>
<p>DFID staff for mission&#8209;critical visits to certain sites in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> Until then, DFID </p>
<p>staff had travelled in civilian rather than military vehicles because of their lower profile, </p>
<p>consistent with the nature of DFID’s work. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> Officials advised Mr Benn that:</p>
<p>“… the continuing threat from EFPs in southern Iraq fundamentally compromises our </p>
<p>ability to complete important projects, particularly in the power and water sectors at </p>
<p>acceptable levels of risk.” </p>
<p><b>378. </b> Three days later, FCO officials recommended to Mr Straw “a safe and measured </p>
<p>return to road moves” for civilian staff in the South “in order to fully promote HMG </p>
<p>objectives”.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> They proposed that, subject to regular review:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>all civilian staff be allowed to travel in Warrior armoured fighting vehicles within </p>
<p>Basra, where there was a significant risk from armour piercing roadside bombs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK civilian police officers be able to travel with contracted British Iraqi Police </p>
<p>Advisers in their FCO armoured vehicles, escorted by UK military Snatch Land </p>
<p>Rovers; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>road moves in FCO armoured vehicles should restart along the main road from </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>taken place on 5 and 6 February, without injuries or damage. The FCO and DFID were </p>
<p>assessing options for a temporary reduction in staff numbers.</p>
<p><b>383. </b> Officials also reported that concerns were growing for local staff, who were </p>
<p>increasingly fearful for their safety “after reports of intimidation and murders of local staff </p>
<p>employed by the UK” and increased tensions surrounding the Shia festival of Ashura. </p>
<p>Mr James Tansley, the Consul General, and others had briefed local staff and did not </p>
<p>believe there was much substance to the rumours:</p>
<p>“However, DFID Basra have offered local staff the option of taking time off if they </p>
<p>feel unsafe, have advised varying routes for those who do come in and have made </p>
<p>arrangements for varying access times and gates to the compound.”</p>
<p><b>384. </b> On 14 February, in a paper for DOP(I), Dr Reid set out transport options for the </p>
<p>British Embassy Office Basra and the UK&#8209;led Basra Provincial Reconstruction Team </p>
<p>(PRT) after the handover of security responsibility to Iraqi control in Maysan and </p>
<p>Muthanna provinces.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> The options included escorts from security contractors “as now, </p>
<p>depending on local threat” and a range of military options including land and air escort.</p>
<p><b>385. </b> DOP(I) agreed the approach set out in the paper.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Departmental reviews of staffing levels</b></p>
<p><b>386. </b> After reviews of personnel safety in response to an upsurge in violence in March </p>
<p>2006, DFID and the FCO concluded that there should be no reduction in staff numbers.</p>
<p><b>387. </b> On 3 March, following attacks on the British Embassy Baghdad and an upsurge in </p>
<p>violence after the bombing of the al&#8209;Askari mosque in Samarra (see Section 9.4), DFID </p>
<p>officials reviewed personnel numbers in Iraq. They recommended to Mr Benn:</p>
<p>“DFID should maintain staffing at current levels for now. The FCO security advice </p>
<p>is that there has been no significant change to our direct threat levels. We assess </p>
<p>that existing staff remain important to the success of our programmes and that </p>
<p>each person continues to deliver effective work despite restrictions on movements. </p>
<p>We judge that HMG can continue to manage known threats robustly.” </p>
<p>271</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>388. </b> That advice was restated two weeks later, in keeping with the conclusions of an </p>

<p><b>389. </b> Mr William Patey, British Ambassador to Iraq, sent an audit of staff and security </p>
<p>to Mr Dominic Asquith, FCO Director Iraq, on 9 March.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> He reported that all staff </p>
<p>appreciated that working in Iraq was not without risk. The UK’s safety record was good:</p>
<p>“Since 2003 we have only suffered two fatal casualties in Baghdad, a DFID oil </p>
<p>contractor</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> and a CRG team member. In Basra two CRG personnel were killed </p>
<p>by the first Explosively Formed Projectile (EFP) in July 2005.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>“Staff have reacted well to recent events … I have reiterated that all staff are </p>
<p>volunteers and if at any time they feel anxious they should make their concerns </p>
<p>known. They are free to leave and no&#8209;one would think the worse of them. No&#8209;one </p>
<p>has asked to leave.”</p>
<p><b>390. </b> Mr Patey recommended no change to staff levels in Baghdad:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reducing the number of consular staff from two to one would result in no cover </p>
<p>during staff absences and leave the Consular Section short staffed during </p>
<p>kidnap cases.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reducing the size of the seven&#8209;strong Management/Security Section would  </p>
<p>be “folly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Political/Economic/Military Section was large by FCO standards, but so </p>
<p>were the demands on it. It could not meet those demands with fewer staff while </p>
<p>ensuring they received the decompression breaks to which they were entitled.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The single Commercial Officer was needed to cover trade promotion and air </p>
<p>service matters.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Head of DFID Iraq, Mr Tim Foy, “takes security seriously and liaises </p>
<p>constantly with us and DFID London”. Mr Foy did not think the security situation </p>
<p>warranted a drawdown of DFID staff.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>2006 was “the year of the Police”. There was a large Civilian Police Section, </p>
<p>but the key UK objective of support to the Iraqi Police Service would have to </p>
<p>be curtailed if numbers were reduced.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr Patey advised that numbers could be reduced In Basra, but that it would have </p>
<p>a severe impact on the service offered “while having a negligible effect on the risk”. </p>
<p>He advised that numbers would have to be cut “drastically” to reduce the risk appreciably. </p>
<p><b>392. </b> Mr Patey explained that risk assessments were reviewed and amended on a daily </p>
<p>basis and in response to each incident:</p>
<p>“Recent changes have been a more rigorous pre&#8209;screening to ensure staff are  </p>
<p>fit enough to cope with security measures and don’t pose a danger to themselves </p>
<p>and others; and the provision of fixed accommodation at BIAP [Basra International </p>

<p>these changes and will not hesitate to recommend changes to the establishment </p>
<p>should we deem them necessary, even at the expense of achieving our objectives. </p>
<p>Both missions have a robust Contingency Plan that can be invoked quickly to  </p>
<p>reduce staff numbers. Having reviewed again the two missions I judge that all  </p>
<p>staff are carrying out, or enabling others to carry out, jobs required of us by our </p>
<p>clients in the UK.”</p>
<p><b>393. </b> On 4 April, Mr Tansley reported a “sustained and substantial” rocket and mortar </p>
<p>attack on the Basra Palace site during the Queen’s Birthday Party reception, with one </p>
<p>salvo hitting and damaging a building belonging to the British Embassy Office.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> No staff </p>
<p>were injured. The attack was the fifth on the Basra Palace site in seven days.</p>
<p><b>394. </b> FCO and DFID officials put advice in parallel to Mr Straw and Mr Benn, </p>
<p>recommending a temporary reduction in the number of staff in Basra (five each from </p>
<p>FCO and DFID), to be reviewed after two weeks.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>395. </b> The IPU explained to Mr Straw that the “security conditions generally in Basra City </p>
<p>have made it impossible for some staff to continue working effectively (the key criterion </p>
<p>for their presence)”. A review of staffing levels had concluded that it was “debatable </p>
<p>whether the benefits of retaining them are commensurate with the risks faced”. </p>
<p><b>396. </b> At the ISG on 7 April, Sir Nigel Sheinwald observed that the drawdown of civilian </p>
<p>staff from the Basra Palace site was a significant development and asked the FCO </p>
<p>and DFID to “consult more widely than their respective Secretaries of State”.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The subsequent advice to Ministers should make clear that:</p>
<p>“Set against the issue of not keeping people somewhere they could not operate, </p>
<p>there was the problem of re&#8209;entry [of civilian staff] and the political or practical </p>
<p>fall&#8209;out of the UK being driven out of the Basra Palace by terrorists. A decision </p>
<p>to locate our civilian presence at the airport would represent a major failure.”</p>
<p><b>397. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts, UK Permanent Representative to NATO and FCO </p>
<p>PUS&#8209;designate, visited Baghdad and Basra from 5 to 7 April.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> In his visit report on </p>
<p>10 April, he endorsed the FCO recommendation. </p>
<p><b>398. </b> Sir Peter described staff as “highly committed and motivated … well led and </p>
<p>managed, doing important work with great enthusiasm and adaptability”. </p>

<p>15.1  |  Civilian personnel</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Sir Peter reported that, although security was a major preoccupation in Baghdad, </p>
<p>the threat from indirect fire seemed to be lower than in Basra and the ability to move </p>
<p>around the Green Zone reduced the sense of claustrophobia. The arrangement with the </p>
<p>RAF for guaranteed helicopter hours</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> seemed to work reasonably well, although there </p>
<p>were some serviceability problems with the helicopters. </p>
<p><b>400. </b> In Basra staff felt “pretty beleaguered”. The main complaint was the difficulty </p>
<p>getting in and out: </p>
<p>“It often takes two or even three days for staff to get to/from Kuwait, given the </p>
<p>frequent delays or cancellations in the helicopter flights to Basra airport, and then </p>
<p>the uncertainties of the RAF surf flights up to Baghdad and then on to Kuwait. </p>
<p>This is intensely frustrating as well as inefficient, and is leading some staff to </p>
<p>consider not taking breather breaks because of the hassle.”</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Sir Peter recommended taking up the issue with the MOD at a high level. </p>
<p>The Basra team perceived that the service had reduced recently because of other </p>
<p>operational pressures on MOD assets:</p>
<p>“It must be in the MOD’s interests to ensure the viability of the Palace Compound, </p>
<p>given the need for an overall plan in the South. Perhaps we should look again at </p>
<p>contracting for a specified number of helicopter hours per month (as in Baghdad). </p>
<p>Failing that, I wonder whether there might be a commercial solution …”</p>
<p><b>402. </b> Sir Peter concluded with a suggestion that, after a period of heavy capital </p>
<p>investment and a big increase in staff, there was probably scope “to start squeezing </p>
<p>down on running costs, eg for the security contracts”. </p>
<p><b>403. </b> On 12 April, Mr Richmond, now FCO Director General Defence and Intelligence, </p>
<p>and Mr Asquith discussed the Basra air bridge with Lieutenant General Nicholas </p>
<p>Houghton, Chief of Joint Operations (CJO), who had returned from Iraq in March.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Richmond and Mr Asquith explained that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO would need “much greater confidence in the reliability of air transport” </p>
<p>between the Basra Palace site, Basra Airport and Kuwait if it was to keep the </p>
<p>staff drawdown to levels that did not have a significant impact on the UK’s ability </p>
<p>to achieve its objectives.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Long delays were preventing staff engaged in the SSR programme from carrying </p>
<p>out their objectives.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>They “suspected that the problem was a mixture of military priorities and </p>
<p>resources”. It was essential that the military viewed the operation in Basra as  </p>
<p>“a team effort”.</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Lt Gen Houghton undertook to investigate the causes of the delays. He advised </p>
<p>that if it was a resource problem, it could probably be resolved only at Ministerial level. </p>
<p>280 </p>
<p>The Inquiry has not seen details of the terms of this arrangement.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Asquith informed Sir Michael Jay that FCO officials were looking again  </p>
<p>at the possibility of a private sector provider for the air bridge service and exploring  </p>
<p>the possibility of using a proposed US military air bridge between the Basra Palace site </p>
<p>and Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>406. </b> On 20 April, FCO and DFID officials recommended the return of a small number </p>
<p>of staff pending a further review in another two weeks.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> Their advice drew on the views </p>
<p>of Mr Robin Lamb, Mr Tansley’s successor as Consul General, who recommended a </p>
<p>two&#8209;stage return, reflecting a reduction in indirect fire over the previous weeks, but also </p>
<p>the continuing constraints on staff mobility and their ability to work effectively.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>407. </b> Sir Michael Jay approved the phased return to normal staffing in Basra on 15 May, </p>
<p>after a brief delay while officials considered the implications of the shooting down of a </p>
<p>UK military helicopter in Basra on 6 May (see Section 9.5).</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> Sir Michael instructed that:</p>
<p>“… the security situation needs to be kept under constant and active review (as </p>
<p>I know it is), and we should be ready to draw down again if the security situation </p>
<p>deteriorates to the extent that staff are unable to carry out their duties, or if we judge </p>
<p>the risk simply too great for them to stay.”</p>
<p><b>408. </b> DFID officials recommended to Mr Benn that DFID also return to full staffing, but </p>
<p>explained that numbers would not rise substantially because DFID’s programme in the </p>
<p>South was “less labour&#8209;intensive” than six months earlier.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> They stated that:</p>
<p>“Numbers will be kept at the current level of eight with an occasional rise to 10 or </p>
<p>11 to account for overlap in rotations. This would mean a breakdown of two out of </p>
<p>three DFID staff and five out of the nine consultants at the [Basra] Palace with a </p>
<p>maximum of three DFID staff and seven consultants during handover periods … </p>
<p>Visitors would be additional to those numbers. Essential visits only will go ahead, </p>
<p>by no more than two visitors and for a maximum of four days at a time.”</p>

<p><b>410. </b> The Basra PRT was established on 14 May 2006 (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> Its first </p>
<p>Head was Mr Mark Etherington, previously Governorate Co&#8209;ordinator of Wasit province.</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Mr Etherington reported on 17 May that the established strength of the PRT was </p>
<p>35, drawn from the UK (FCO, DFID, MOD and the inter&#8209;departmental Post&#8209;Conflict </p>
<p>Reconstruction Unit (PCRU)), Denmark and the US. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Etherington described the “substantial” challenges facing the PRT in Basra. </p>
<p>He judged that:</p>
<p>“… <i>we have but one chance properly to configure and launch the PRT in order to </i></p>
<p><i>maximise the chances of its success.</i> For this reason we would wish to retain in </p>
<p>theatre for as long as possible those resources that are already here …</p>
<p>“… <i>The key to the PRT’s capabilities will be the retention of a core of long&#8209;term </i></p>
<p><i>civilian expertise in each envisaged work strand. Basra is our main problem  </i></p>
<p><i>and the notion of withdrawing valuable staff as the PRT gears up to tackle it is </i></p>
<p><i>counter&#8209;intuitive</i>.”</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Mr Etherington advised that:</p>
<p>“The PRT, because of its integrated civil&#8209;military structure, has continued to function </p>
<p>despite the difficult security environment. The military component is able to travel </p>
<p>when the civilian component cannot … In the event of a protracted deterioration </p>
<p>in security terms, the PRT would also be forced to cease military capacity&#8209;building </p>
<p>efforts in Basra; and it is probable that our Iraqi partners would be reluctant to </p>
<p>continue meeting us. In these circumstances the PRT would have to suspend its </p>
<p>work altogether until security was restored.”</p>
<p><b>414. </b> In August and September 2006, the US Office of the Special Inspector General </p>
<p>for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) examined whether PRTs were “fully empowered, </p>
<p>staffed and resourced to meet their mission, and to identify any other barriers impeding </p>
<p>achievement of the PRT mission” (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p>287</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>415. </b> The SIGIR audit, published on 29 October, concluded that the creation of 10 PRTs </p>
<p>and eight satellite offices was a “noteworthy achievement”, but that many obstacles </p>
<p>to effective operation remained, including insecurity, a lag in funding, the difficulty of </p>
<p>recruiting and retaining qualified civilian personnel, and the difficulty of integrating </p>
<p>civilian and military personnel. </p>
<p><b>416. </b> The audit stated that the unstable security situation in Basra meant that PRT </p>
<p>members had not been able to interact personally with their Iraqi counterparts, </p>
<p>significantly limiting the Basra PRT’s ability to achieve its mission. It questioned </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p>“whether the continued deployment of PRT personnel to … Basra … makes operational </p>
<p>sense at this time”. </p>
<p><b>417. </b> More widely, the report stated that, because of the US Government’s difficulties in </p>
<p>recruiting civilians to serve in PRTs, a majority of positions were initially filled by military </p>
<p>civil affairs personnel. In September 2006, of 128 positions allocated to civilians, 77 had </p>
<p>been filled; of the 163 allocated to the military, just two were vacant. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> The Inquiry has seen no evidence that the SIGIR audit was seen or considered </p>
<p>by UK officials. </p>
<p><b>419. </b> In a review of the first eight months of the Basra PRT commissioned by the  </p>
<p>PCRU and produced in March 2007, Mr Etherington made a number of </p>
<p>recommendations, including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><i>Key staff should be held to a minimum of one year tours, with the requisite </i></p>
<p><i>adjustments for welfare and travel. </i>The repeated and cyclical loss of experience </p>
<p>in south&#8209;east Iraq [in] 2006 was damaging.</p>
<p><i>• </i></p>
<p><i>Where integrated bodies such as the PRT are raised in future, they should be </i></p>
<p><i>recruited or sub&#8209;contracted by a single authority and to a single contractual </i></p>
<p><i>template</i>, with clear procedures established for grievance and misconduct. </p>
<p>Ideally such groups would train together … and move to theatre as a formed </p>
<p>body. That single authority would also be financially and administratively </p>
<p>responsible for the operating requirements of the group.” </p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Mr Etherington added:</p>
<p>“The lack of clarity regarding ownership of the PRT caused substantial administrative </p>
<p>difficulty, for the PRT disposed of no assets of its own and no single department </p>
<p>believed itself responsible for it …</p>
<p>“Unlike other PRTs in Iraq, the UK&#8209;led team was assembled in large measure from </p>
<p>existing effort … While this conferred valuable operational momentum and expertise </p>
<p>on a new team it significantly complicated administration, because the team had </p>
<p>to merge a wide array of existing contracts, leave schemes, equipment, security </p>
<p>procedures and cultures while lacking any defined mandate to do so.</p>
<p>“The administrative world which the PRT was forced to inhabit was always difficult, </p>
<p>and verged in the early months on Kafka&#8209;esque. An FCO car in the Iraq support </p>
<p>team at Kuwait airport would not pick up the inbound PCRU&#8209;contracted PRT office </p>
<p>manager – or book her hotel – because she was ‘not an FCO responsibility’.”</p>

<p>317</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Etherington singled out staffing as the best illustration of the difficulties faced  </p>
<p>by the PRT: </p>
<p>“… the commercial company Enterplan fielded the bulk of consultants for </p>
<p>DFID; which in turn seconded them into the PRT. Perhaps understandably, the </p>
<p>consultants … tended to look to either or both of their original employers for </p>
<p>guidance and recourse; and this divided loyalty persisted because UK departments, </p>
<p>upon whom the PRT concept had largely been forced, were lukewarm about the </p>

<p>separate departmental structures … While this undoubtedly exposed companies like </p>
<p>Enterplan to risk – after all, it was they who were contractually bound to individuals </p>
<p>– it also allowed them undue influence in theatre and allowed the possibility </p>
<p>that conflicts of interest might arise. In the only instance of the period in which </p>
<p>misconduct proceedings were initiated these difficulties became obvious.</p>
<p>“The PRT consisted, at peak, of staff on seven different kinds of contract … and the </p>
<p>cumulative effect of managing … [different] leave schemes, together with a range </p>
<p>of other frictions, was to make the maintenance of momentum almost comically </p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>“The sheer throughput of staff exacerbated this difficulty. This tended to be because </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>425. </b> The main findings included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Significant deterioration in the security of UK posts: in Basra, because of </p>
<p>insufficient military protection; in Baghdad, because of the increasing threat </p>
<p>from extremists.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An increasing threat of kidnap. FCO security officials were looking at providing </p>
<p>key staff with transponders to detect their location in case they were captured.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The SOSA’s judgement that senior staff were facing “undue political pressure to </p>
<p>‘produce the goods’ which could lead to the acceptance of inappropriate levels </p>
<p>of risk”. Security managers and heads of close protection teams were “acting </p>
<p>as a constraint on senior staff movements to risky areas”.</p>

<p>Mr Straw as Foreign Secretary in early May 2006:</p>
<p>“We have always been aware of the risks of operating in Iraq. Because of the </p>
<p>political importance to the UK of our work in Iraq, we have judged it acceptable to </p>
<p>tolerate a higher level of risk there (and in southern Afghanistan) than elsewhere </p>
<p>in the world. But our duty of care towards our staff, and towards those from other </p>
<p>government departments who work in our posts, remains.</p>
<p>“We invest considerable resources in reducing as far as is possible the risk to our </p>
<p>staff, and all those for whom we are responsible. We have in place robust structures </p>
<p>to manage and mitigate risk, which are subject to constant review, in response to </p>
<p>changes in the situation on the ground. We recognise, however, that there remains </p>
<p>a residual level of risk in operating in such an extreme environment, against which </p>
<p>we cannot wholly protect ourselves.” </p>

<p>asked for another review to look at “the context for our operations in Iraq; our broad </p>
<p>approach to the risks we face; the structures and procedures we have in place to </p>
<p>manage the risks; the extent to which these are being observed in practice; and whether </p>

<p>Embassy Office. UK and US LE staff were regularly intimidated in Baghdad and Basra. </p>
<p>One US LE member of staff had been murdered in Basra on 4 June. Multi&#8209;National </p>
<p>Force – Iraq (MNF&#8209;I) interpreters had also been killed. </p>
<p><b>436. </b> Mr Asquith reported that Mr Lamb had advised LE staff not to come to work  </p>
<p>until further notice, although local labourers and support staff working for contractors  </p>
<p>on the premises had continued to come in. A number of steps were under consideration </p>
<p>to improve LE staff security. The attack was not judged to have changed the security </p>
<p>conditions for UK&#8209;based civilians and it was not, therefore, proposed to draw down  </p>
<p>UK staff. </p>
<p><b>437. </b> DFID officials put further recommendations to Mr Benn on 23 June, drawing on </p>
<p>advice from DFID Basra.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> Pending agreement from the FCO, which was expected </p>
<p>imminently, officials recommended that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>at his own request, the DFID LE staff member in Basra should leave the country </p>
<p>as soon as possible on a two&#8209;month development attachment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the locally contracted administrative assistant for power projects should be </p>
<p>relocated to Basra Airport; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>two other locally contracted staff should work from home for two months. </p>
<p><b>438. </b> On 14 July, DFID officials explained to Mr Benn that DFID and the FCO had </p>
<p>adopted different approaches:</p>
<p>“FCO offered their office&#8209;based staff three months’ salary if they wanted to leave. </p>
<p>We believe most have now accepted this offer. FCO is now deciding if and how to fill </p>
<p>these positions with either UK or third country nationals … Although far from ideal, </p>
<p>this has so far had no significant impact on DFID’s work. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We suggest that, where staff can work remotely (on project sites, at home, in </p>
<p>town), we should continue to employ them on the same basis as before and that we </p>
<p>maintain our position on this as originally planned despite it differing from the FCO </p>
<p>approach. Our circumstances are different. FCO local staff are needed on a daily </p>
<p>basis at the [Basra] Palace. Most of our local staff are not and the two administrative </p>
<p>staff who were, have already resigned. All of our local staff know that they have the </p>
<p>option to work flexibly, to take time off if they feel threatened and to leave if they feel </p>
<p>it is too dangerous.” </p>

<p><b>439. </b> The introduction of the Locally Engaged Staff Assistance Scheme in 2007 in </p>
<p>recognition of the uniquely difficult circumstances faced by LE staff is addressed later </p>
<p>in this Section.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> The IPU review of security submitted to Sir Michael Jay on 30 June examined the </p>
<p>FCO’s approach to risk in Iraq, structures and procedures to manage that risk, the extent </p>
<p>to which those structures and procedures were being observed in practice and whether </p>
<p>they satisfied the FCO’s legal obligations towards its staff.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>441. </b> The IPU explained that other FCO departments had contributed to the review. </p>
<p>DFID officials had also participated and would report to their Ministers separately. </p>
<p><b>442. </b> The IPU stated that the FCO approach to risk derived from its “duty of care in law </p>
<p>to take reasonable steps to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm to … FCO employees </p>
<p>(UK&#8209;based and locally engaged) as well as those who visit the premises of our missions </p>
<p>and work from there eg from OGDs”. </p>
<p><b>443. </b> The description of the FCO’s duty of care was derived from a paper  </p>
<p>prepared by FCO Legal Advisers as part of the 2004 FCO Security Review. The Legal </p>
<p>Advisers stated:</p>
<p>“Whether a duty of care exists in particular cases depends on whether the death, </p>
<p>injury or damage sustained was foreseeable, whether there was a relationship </p>
<p>between the FCO and the claimant viewed by a court as one of ‘proximity’ and </p>
<p>whether the court considers it fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty …</p>
<p>“Even if a duty of care does exist in a particular case, the FCO is liable in law only if </p>
<p>it is found to have breached that duty, ie to have fallen below a reasonable standard </p>
<p>of conduct through negligent acts or omissions. The fact that an attack on a mission </p>
<p>has succeeded does not necessarily mean that the FCO was at fault or has failed to </p>
<p>act reasonably.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>444. </b> The IPU described the FCO’s “basic approach” as “risk averse”:</p>
<p>“… if we judge a situation exists whereby personnel are exposed to greater  </p>
<p>risk than the mitigating measures in place to deal with that risk, that task will not  </p>
<p>be undertaken …”</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Decision&#8209;making structures were reported to be in line with the recommendations </p>
<p>of the 2004 review. London decision&#8209;makers were the Foreign Secretary, the PUS (and </p>
<p>FCO Board of Management) and the Iraq Director, supported by the IPU. Advice was </p>
<p>provided by the Director General Corporate Affairs and Director General Defence and </p>
<p>Intelligence and their subsidiary departments, and by FCO Legal Advisers. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>446. </b> The decision&#8209;makers in Iraq were the Heads of Post and Post Security Officers </p>
<p>in Baghdad, Basra and Kirkuk, advised by their Overseas Security Managers (OSMs), </p>
<p>Post Security Committees and the UK military.</p>
<p><b>447. </b> The IPU set out the risk assessment procedures for posts in Iraq: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>daily assessment in each post of all operations in or out of compounds and daily </p>
<p>contact between the FCO and posts;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>weekly meetings of Post Security Committees, with records copied to the FCO </p>
<p>with recommendations as necessary;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>every six weeks “on average”, a London&#8209;based “Nuts and Bolts” meeting to </p>
<p>review measures in place and agree next steps, involving relevant FCO officials </p>
<p>and other government departments as necessary;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>quarterly visits to posts by a UK&#8209;based FCO OSA, who completed a risk </p>
<p>assessment matrix in line with FCO worldwide procedures;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>immediate reviews of security measures in response to incidents or fresh </p>
<p>intelligence; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regular reviews of contingency plans and business continuity planning.</p>
<p><b>448. </b> The IPU concluded that those procedures were “closely observed” and that steps </p>
<p>taken by the FCO to manage the risks to staff for whom it had a duty of care “could be </p>
<p>used as evidence of a reasonable standard of conduct by the FCO”. More work was </p>
<p>needed to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve pre&#8209;deployment procedures for staff from certain departments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clarify with the MOD arrangements for the evacuation of third country nationals </p>
<p>employed by the FCO as contractors; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clarify the status of UK civilian police in Iraq: “It remains unclear whether they </p>
<p>are our employees or remain employees of their constabularies.”</p>
<p><b>449. </b> In an annex to the review, the IPU summarised departments’ and organisations’ </p>
<p>responsibilities for the security of local and UK&#8209;based staff and contractors. It stated </p>
<p>that the FCO’s duty of care “would extend to any visiting FCO staff and staff seconded </p>
<p>temporarily to the FCO or working directly under FCO supervision and control”.  </p>
<p>The FCO had “a similar duty of care” to employees of other government departments, </p>
<p>foreign governments or international organisations “who live and/or work on or visit </p>
<p>the relevant mission compounds”. In practice, measures to protect those personnel </p>
<p>had to be the same as for FCO staff. “Inevitably”, pre&#8209;deployment or pre&#8209;visit training </p>
<p>and medical clearance might vary, but in the case of other government departments it </p>
<p>was “clearly desirable that close co&#8209;ordination occurs and that the same or equivalent </p>
<p>measures are adopted”. </p>
<p><b>450. </b> The annex also stated that the standard of care for contractors “may, in particular </p>
<p>circumstances, be lower than that required for employees”. Those circumstances </p>
<p>included where contractors had security expertise of their own and when it “may not </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>15.1  |  Civilian personnel</p>
<p>323</p>
<p>be unreasonable for the FCO to expect them to make their own assessment as to the </p>
<p>risks to their own staff (eg while travelling to and from post)”. Contracts with such firms </p>
<p>and agencies needed to be carefully vetted and contractors were required to have </p>
<p>employers’ liability insurance. </p>
<p><b>451. </b> The IPU recommended that as many members of the FCO Board as possible </p>
<p>attend a meeting to discuss:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact of the Iraqiisation of Iraqi Security Forces on security in Baghdad;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact of the withdrawal of UK military personnel on security in the South;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a thorough review of staffing levels; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a contingency planning exercise on coping with an emergency in Iraq, to be </p>
<p>attended by as many Board members as possible.</p>
<p><b>452. </b> Sir Michael Jay agreed the IPU recommendations on 3 July.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> He asked for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the status of civilian police to be clarified quickly;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirmation that a number of specific issues were being addressed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>advice on measures to protect local staff should UK&#8209;based staff be evacuated.</p>
<p><b>453. </b> The IPU responded on 19 July:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Efforts were in hand to tighten DFID’s pre&#8209;deployment medical screening </p>
<p>procedures for staff and contractors.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pre&#8209;deployment procedures for police officers would be brought in line with </p>
<p>those for FCO personnel by 1 September.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concerns remained about arrangements for the evacuation of third country </p>
<p>nationals employed by the UK. A UK military assumption that third country </p>
<p>nationals would be evacuated was unsatisfactory and was being pursued with </p>
<p>the MOD. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Home Office had challenged the FCO view that police officers on </p>
<p>secondment from their home police force were not FCO employees. The issue </p>
<p>was with lawyers. The status of retired police officers was also being discussed </p>
<p>with lawyers.</p>

<p>(e)  the vulnerability of the BPC to indirect fire (mortars and rockets) …</p>
<p>“We need to accept that the risks for UK&#8209;based staff are high and do everything </p>
<p>possible to mitigate them. For example, we have mitigated the major threats (IDF </p>
<p>[indirect fire], EFP and kidnapping) to an acceptable extent by providing hardened </p>
<p>living accommodation, limiting helicopter flights to the hours of darkness, varying </p>
<p>routes, using Warriors or three vehicle convoys, as appropriate, requiring minimum </p>
<p>movement outside after dark and full body armour and constantly reviewing our alert </p>
<p>status in the light of the latest intelligence …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“For LE staff the threat is much greater and, I judge, increasing. We and IPU are </p>
<p>wrestling with the dilemma of how to justify continuing to employ a bare minimum </p>
<p>of staff … in the light of the current threat to them.” </p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>455. </b> Dr Marsden advised that the next six to nine months would be critical to Basra </p>
<p>and the UK legacy. The UK needed “to maintain a big operation here during that period </p>
<p>– and indeed somewhat expand it”. The level of risk was likely to increase in the short </p>
<p>term with the planned military surge (Operation Salamanca, see Section 9.5), but the </p>
<p>reinforcement of the UK military presence in the BPC from 430 to 600 with the arrival of </p>

<p><b>457. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts chaired a meeting with FCO, DFID and MOD officials on  </p>
<p>1 September to review security at UK posts in Iraq.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> He informed Mrs Beckett that the </p>
<p>meeting had seen no need to change Sir Michael Jay’s four conditions for any FCO </p>
<p>member of staff serving in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Sir Peter reported that there had been a roadside attack on an Embassy convoy  </p>
<p>in Baghdad on 31 August and a similar attack on a DFID convoy in Nasiriyah on  </p>
<p>1 September. One CRG employee had been badly injured in the Nasiriyah attack. Other </p>
<p>examples of the evolving threat and risks included increased indirect fire attacks on the </p>
<p>compounds in Baghdad and Basra. As risks increased, security measures evolved to </p>
<p>mitigate them, but Sir Peter had concerns about two issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pressure to accommodate increasing numbers of officials and/or military staff </p>
<p>with space in Baghdad and Basra at a premium. Sir Peter had asked officials to </p>
<p>consider whether any functions, particularly on the management side, could be </p>
<p>outsourced or relocated.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The vulnerability of the Basra Palace site. The helicopter air bridge was mission </p>
<p>critical. Because of wider problems with MOD helicopter availability, the FCO </p>
<p>had had to start the procurement process for a dedicated helicopter service paid </p>
<p>for by the FCO. </p>
<p><b>459. </b> Later in September, Mr Asquith, who had replaced Mr Patey as British Ambassador </p>
<p>to Iraq, advised Sir Peter Ricketts that the two attacks on UK convoys demonstrated the </p>
<p>effectiveness of the UK’s risk management measures.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> The number of staff at post was </p>
<p>evaluated continually to ensure they were able to contribute to post objectives. </p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Asquith reported that space on the compound in Baghdad was at a premium, </p>
<p>but the Embassy had not reached crisis point. He saw little scope for more outsourcing. </p>
<p>Greater use of LE staff was the obvious option, but it was difficult to find Iraqi staff willing </p>
<p>to work in the International Zone and, with no robust way of vetting new staff, there were </p>
<p>questions of trust and security.</p>

<p><b>461. </b> Mr Asquith ended with the recommendation that the UK effort be seen in context:</p>
<p>“After the US we have the largest investment and the largest presence. Others look </p>
<p>to us for direction. A major reduction in our resources risks being misunderstood </p>
<p>as a signal of reduced commitment. Every prospective six months has been billed </p>
<p>as a key period. But we have between now and next spring a clutch of determining </p>
<p>events: the Baghdad Security Plan, constitutional review, oil law, amnesty, </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification, provincial elections, International Compact, security transition …  </p>
<p>I will continue to evaluate the risk and the level of resources.”</p>
<p><b>462. </b> In his response to Mr Asquith on 9 October, Sir Peter Ricketts concluded:</p>

<p>had already been taken to reduce staff exposure to the increased threat, including </p>

<p><b>470. </b> In the paper, the IPU stated:</p>
<p>“The threat to our civilian staff operating from the Basra Palace Compound (BPC) </p>
<p>has risen steadily over the last year, progressively constraining our operations …  </p>
<p><b>We are now at the point where, without effective military action to reduce the </b></p>
<p><b>IDF threat, our operations from BPC face an unacceptable level of risk.</b></p>
<p>“We need to respond. We have four broad options:</p>
<p><b>a) </b></p>
<p><b>Continue to run all our civilian operations from BPC …</b></p>
<p><b>b) </b></p>
<p><b>Start a phased reduction in staff at BPC now …</b></p>

<p>“Until now we have recommended that we maintain our civilian operations at BPC, </p>
<p>despite the deteriorating security situation. We have recently launched a major, </p>
<p>integrated military and civilian effort in Basra – Op SINBAD/Better Basra [see </p>
<p>Section 10.2] – which is designed to produce sustainable change in the city and to </p>
<p>achieve transition to Iraqi&#8209;led security responsibility. The civilian component is critical </p>
<p>to the success of this effort.</p>
<p>“But in the last month the security threat has become so acute that, <b>unless current </b></p>
<p><b>trends can be reversed, in particular by direct action to reduce IDF, </b>the risks </p>
<p>to our civilian staff in BPC can no longer be justified. We could suffer a catastrophic </p>

<p>BPC operation to a minimum. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>330</p>
<p><b>482. </b> In the paper, the IPU explained that:</p>
<p>“The political and security context for our civilian operations in southern Iraq is </p>
<p>changing significantly. The heightened security threat, which forced us to draw down </p>
<p>staff from Basra Palace in October, shows no sign of abating. We expect security </p>
<p>responsibility in Basra to be transferred to the Iraqis in spring 2007. And MOD are </p>
<p>considering a major reposturing of UK forces in the coming months, with direct </p>
<p>implications for civilian operations.</p>
<p>“… In the political and security environment we are likely to face, what can we </p>
<p>realistically hope to deliver? What civilian resources do we need to deliver those </p>
<p>objectives, and where should they best be deployed?” </p>
<p>321</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>483. </b> The IPU strongly recommended that the UK “maintain a civilian effort in Basra </p>
<p>province during 2007”. The intention was to co&#8209;locate as much as possible of the civilian </p>
<p>effort with MND(SE) at Basra Air Station, where plans were being pursued to construct </p>
<p>suitable hardened facilities, without closing off immediately the option of returning to the </p>
<p>Basra Palace site in future. </p>
<p><b>484. </b> The IPU explained that the current PJHQ proposal was to close all bases in </p>
<p>Basra City by April 2007 and to consolidate at Basra Air Station. Two military bases </p>
<p>would close during January/February. The Basra Palace base, which was essential </p>
<p>for sustaining the civilian presence, would close by 1 March. If Ministers agreed those </p>
<p>proposals, there would be just 12 weeks to move personnel and equipment from </p>
<p>the Basra Palace site to Basra Air Station: “an extremely tight timetable, given the </p>
<p>operational constraints in theatre”.</p>
<p><b>485. </b> The IPU advised that there was no prospect of being able to recommend to </p>
<p>Ministers a return to full staffing at the Basra Palace site in the near future. It was equally </p>
<p>clear that there was “a powerful and urgent imperative for us to get our in&#8209;country civilian </p>
<p>operations back up to strength as quickly as possible, to deliver in the critical period </p>
<p>ahead”.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> The IPU added that conditions for staff at Basra Air Station would be “much </p>
<p>tougher” than at the Basra Palace site:</p>
<p>“Travel to/from Basra will become much harder. We are likely to face staff </p>
<p>recruitment and retention challenges. Space will be limited. With only 54 hardened </p>
<p>units of accommodation we will need to make difficult choices about priorities.</p>
<p>“But against that, there will be significant advantages in co&#8209;location with the military </p>
<p>– making possible a more cohesive approach than is currently possible from </p>
<p>different sites in Basra.” </p>

<p>331</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Introducing the paper at DOP(I) on 7 December 2006, Mrs Beckett stated that </p>
<p>the decision to drawdown from the Basra Palace site had been right.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p> Work in hand </p>
<p>suggested that the majority of civilian staff should be relocated to Basra Air Station, </p>
<p>but urgent work was needed to make it fit for purpose, and moving staff there would </p>
<p>undoubtedly make it a more attractive target for insurgents. Whitehall departments </p>
<p>needed to co&#8209;ordinate plans and engage with the US.</p>
<p><b>488. </b> A joint PCRU/DFID report on refocusing civilian efforts in Basra, produced on  </p>
<p>19 December 2006, stated:</p>
<p>“It is worth noting that the rapid (unavoidable) drawdown from Basra Palace  </p>
<p>did raise concerns among MND(SE) partners about civilian commitment and  </p>
<p>the physical move to Basra Air Station has required considerable time and attention </p>
<p>… Construction of hardened accommodation on the FCO site at BAS is under way </p>
<p>… but the pace of the build may slip … Claims on accommodation must be seen in </p>
<p>the ‘round’ of a total demand which exceeded supply.” </p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry:</p>
<p><i>“</i>When it became clear that the Armed Forces would in due course be moving out </p>
<p>of the Basra Palace in the centre of Basra, and that became increasingly clear in the </p>
<p>latter part of 2006, I was clear that our Consulate [the British Embassy Office] had </p>
<p>to either shut and go back to Baghdad or operate out of the Air Station.” </p>

<p>the Basra Palace site and two other locations in central Basra.</p>
<p><b>493. </b> In Baghdad, the SOSA’s main concern was the security of the International Zone </p>
<p>after the handing over of checkpoints to Iraqi control. The US would ensure that its </p>
<p>Mission remained well protected and there was a danger that the UK compound would </p>
<p>become the target by default. The SOSA recommended:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that a more senior member of the Embassy staff (he suggested the Deputy </p>
<p>Head of Mission) attend meetings of the US&#8209;led International Zone security </p>
<p>committee; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>implementation of a number of urgent steps to strengthen and harden physical </p>
<p>security on the UK compound. </p>
<p><b>494. </b> In Basra by 15 March, most staff had left the Basra Palace site and the move to </p>
<p>the COB was on track for completion by the end of the month.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> The UK military were </p>
<p>expected to remain at the Palace until 1 August. </p>
<p><b>495. </b> Some DFID members of the PRT for whom there was insufficient hardened </p>
<p>accommodation in the COB were based temporarily in a PRT office in Kuwait.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>496. </b> Mr Casey informed Sir Peter Ricketts that the SOSA was content for the </p>
<p>International Police Advisers (IPAs) employed by the contractor ArmorGroup to remain </p>
<p>at the Provincial Joint Co&#8209;ordination Centre (PJCC) within the police headquarters, also </p>
<p>known as the Warren, but confirmed that the arrangement would be kept under review </p>
<p>because of concerns about the site’s viability and the fact that it was co&#8209;occupied by </p>
<p>the Iraqi Police.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> Because there was insufficient space in the FCO’s new facilities </p>
<p>for those IPAs located at the COB, they would be accommodated in a separate COB </p>
<p>compound with a lower standard of overhead protection. Officials were satisfied that the </p>
<p>arrangement met the FCO’s duty of care obligations, subject to a written agreement with </p>

<p><b>499. </b> The move from Kirkuk to a temporary site at the Khanzad Hotel in Erbil had been </p>
<p>precipitated by the US decision to relinquish the site in Kirkuk on which the British </p>
<p>Embassy Office had been located. One benefit for UK staff would be the better security </p>
<p>environment in Erbil.</p>
<p><b>500. </b> On 22 April, the Chief Overseas Security Manager (COSM) at the British Embassy </p>
<p>Baghdad reported the first IDF attack in many months in which rounds had impacted </p>
<p>inside the Embassy compound.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> Basic procedures in the Embassy had worked well:</p>
<p>“The incident was well controlled by the Embassy Operations Room, staffed by CRG </p>
<p>… The Garda World Gurkha Guard Force were excellent in their cordon and search </p>
<p>operation. All wardens should also be congratulated on the speedy manner in which </p>
<p>they conducted the head count. I was therefore able to give the FCO Response </p>
<p>Centre in London an accurate report that all were safe and well within 15 minutes </p>
<p>of the first impact.”</p>
<p><b>501. </b> The COSM concluded with a number of lessons to be learned locally, including </p>
<p>the need for an urgent review of the provision of “Duck and Cover” shelters and for staff </p>
<p>to be patient while searches were carried out.</p>
<p><b>502. </b> The British Embassy Office site on the Basra Palace site was handed over to </p>
<p>the UK military on 26 April.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p> Mr Robert Tinline, Deputy Consul General in Basra and </p>
<p>Mr Etherington’s successor as Head of the Basra PRT, reported that over 1,200 rockets </p>
<p>and mortars had been fired at the Basra Palace site since attacks had increased in </p>
<p>September 2006 and that the site had been hit 70 times: </p>
<p>“We were fortunate that none of our staff were killed or injured. (Others in other parts </p>
<p>of the compound fared less well.) But we also made our own good fortune. Four </p>
<p>accommodation ‘pods’, the bar, the gym and both the main office buildings received </p>
<p>direct hits – but because they were hardened, no serious injuries resulted. Six of the </p>
<p>reinforced windows were hit by shrapnel – none gave way. Mortars landed one side </p>
<p>of ‘Hesco’ sandbag walls, leaving people the other side unharmed.”</p>
<p><b>503. </b> Mr Tinline explained that the whole Basra Palace site was scheduled to be handed </p>
<p>back to the Iraqis in late summer. The Iraqi authorities were expected to assume full </p>
<p>security responsibility for Basra province at about the same time.</p>
<p><b>504. </b> On 21 May, Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, requested additional funds </p>
<p>from the Treasury for hardened accommodation to protect troops at the COB; April had </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Mr Stephen Timms, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, approved the request on </p>
<p>30 May, but asked Mr Browne to take a government&#8209;wide view of how to allocate the </p>
<p>funds, working with Mrs Beckett and others.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>506. </b> The next day, Mrs Beckett submitted a parallel request for additional funds for </p>
<p>an urgent programme of security works at the British Embassy Baghdad to meet the </p>
<p>increased threat that would follow Iraqiisation of security in the International Zone.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Mrs Beckett explained:</p>
<p>“The £23m work in Baghdad … will only be affordable if other departments  </p>
<p>who use the compound are prepared to contribute their full share … Of ‘teeth’  </p>
<p>staff on the compound, and contractors involved in operational delivery (such  </p>
<p>as police advisers), fewer than 50 percent are FCO … Of course, there are also </p>
<p>large numbers of contractors who provide security and life support, which is a </p>
<p>shared benefit. </p>
<p>“If we are not able collectively to make this investment, we would have to look hard </p>
<p>at how we could continue to operate safely and sustainably, meeting our duty of care </p>
<p>to all compound users and residents …”</p>
<p><b>507. </b> Mr Timms replied on 19 June. He welcomed FCO efforts to reduce and absorb </p>
<p>costs and agreed that the FCO should “work with other departments to agree joint </p>
<p>funding”.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p> He expressed willingness to agree a request to use End&#8209;Year Flexibility</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>“if, after agreeing contributions with other departments and taking all viable steps to </p>
<p>reduce and absorb this pressure, the costs cannot be managed within your capital </p>
<p>budget this year”. </p>
<p><b>508. </b> The limited availability of hardened accommodation at the COB and the lack of </p>
<p>space to build more caused growing concern as the frequency and accuracy of IDF </p>
<p>attacks increased.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>509. </b> On 20 April. the IPU explained to Sir Peter Ricketts that IPAs employed by the FCO </p>
<p>contractor ArmorGroup were housed in the Skylink commercial caravan park, which </p>
<p>offered a lower standard of protection from IDF attacks. The Skylink accommodation no </p>
<p>longer presented an acceptable level of risk. In response, the FCO intended:</p>
<p>“… to continue to exert downwards pressure on overall civilian staff numbers in </p>
<p>Basra, so as to allow us to move all our IPAs into our new compound as soon as </p>
<p>possible … To this end, we and post will continue to look critically at all civilian slots, </p>

<p>In the period covered by the Inquiry, the Treasury allowed departments to carry forward unspent funds </p>

<p>whenever possible (including downsizing the IPA contingent itself).</p>
<p>“This is a difficult balancing act: our civilian staff play a critical role in securing the </p>
<p>progress necessary to complete our overall mission. Pulling too many out too quickly </p>
<p>will undermine our chances of success, and potentially prolong the need for our </p>
<p>presence. But we will aim to get everyone into fully hardened accommodation by </p>
<p>31 July. In early August our military will leave Basra Palace and we can expect IDF </p>
<p>rates at the Air Station [COB] to increase further, as it becomes the sole target for </p>
<p>such attacks.”</p>
<p><b>510. </b> The IPU explained that, in the meantime, the FCO was taking steps to reduce the </p>
<p>risk to those accommodated on the Skylink site. If personnel based there were injured </p>
<p>or killed, the FCO could be open to claims of negligence if it failed to demonstrate that </p>
<p>it had fulfilled its duty of care obligations. The FCO Legal Advisers’ view was that the </p>
<p>measures taken and ArmorGroup’s explicit written agreement to the arrangement would </p>
<p>put the FCO on strong ground in refuting such claims. </p>
<p><b>511. </b> The IPU warned that if the FCO was to stop use of the Skylink accommodation </p>
<p>it would have to remove the vast majority of the IPAs from Basra or make “deep cuts” </p>
<p>to other parts of the mission, severely disrupting work in Basra at a critical time. </p>
<p><b>512. </b> On 30 April, there was a direct hit on the ArmorGroup IPA office.</p>
<p>339</p>
<p> The unhardened </p>
<p>room was not occupied at the time and there were no casualties. Two IPAs in the </p>
<p>adjacent cabin were unharmed. On the basis of reports from the OSM, Mr McDonald </p>
<p>issued instructions to Basra that all personnel under FCO duty of care should move </p>
<p>to hardened accommodation immediately. </p>
<p><b>513. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra sent proposals for a reduction in personnel </p>
<p>“to a level that should provide adequate security and acceptable living conditions for </p>
<p>all personnel operating from the COB, while maintaining operational effectiveness”. </p>
<p>The FCO would reduce from 12 to 10 and the Control Risks security team from 32 </p>
<p>to 24, subject to a review by the Overseas Security Adviser later in the month. Those </p>
<p>reductions would allow the police teams to remain at existing levels and allow three </p>
<p>members of the PRT to return to Basra, increasing its numbers from 11 to 14. </p>
<p><b>514. </b> Mr Benn expressed concern to DFID officials that the appropriate levels of </p>
<p>protection were not yet in place.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p><b>515. </b> Officials explained that all staff under DFID’s duty of care had been under hard </p>

<p>The hardened dining area was due to be completed by mid&#8209;July, but contingency plans </p>
<p>were being put in place should IDF attacks prohibit use of the military facility.</p>
<p><b>516. </b> Ministers discussed security for civilian staff at DOP(I) on 11 May.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> Mr Benn </p>
<p>expressed concern that hardened dining facilities were not yet available. </p>
<p><b>517. </b> In his valedictory report to Mr David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, on 16 August, </p>
<p>Mr Asquith paid tribute to the work of LE and UK&#8209;based staff.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> LE staff had:</p>
<p>“… struggled daily to our offices, in Baghdad, Basra and when we were in Kirkuk, </p>
<p>through the wreckage that Shock and Awe and subsequent decisions produces. </p>
<p>They have risked their lives. Some have lost them. All have lost a friend or relation. </p>
<p>All have suffered massive upheaval … I hope that … the decision will be the right </p>
<p>one when eventually Ministers address collectively how to provide protection to </p>
<p>those who supplicate us.”</p>
<p><b>518. </b> On UK&#8209;based staff, Mr Asquith wrote:</p>
<p>“By the end of a tour in any one of our three posts in Iraq, an officer experiences </p>
<p>what elsewhere takes three or four years. Their professionalism and fortitude is of </p>
<p>the highest order. Their determination to secure a better future for Iraq, in the face </p>
<p>of daily frustration and barbarity, is a source of wonderment – particularly against </p>
<p>a background when resources and attention are being diverted elsewhere.”</p>
<p><b>519. </b> In advance of a Ministerial meeting planned for 19 July, FCO and MOD officials </p>
<p>produced a joint paper setting out the latest “assessments and plans on security </p>
<p>transition and the associated reposturing and drawdown of UK troops in Basra” </p>
<p>(see Section 9.6).</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>520. </b> The paper had been discussed, in draft, at the ISG on 9 July, where it was </p>
<p>agreed that the departure from the Basra Palace site and the Warren should happen </p>
<p>simultaneously.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>521. </b> In the paper, officials explained that the next key decision for Ministers was the </p>
<p>timing of the withdrawal from the Basra Palace site, the “most heavily mortared and </p>
<p>rocketed place in Iraq”. This was complicated for a number or reasons, including the </p>
<p>impact on the UK’s SSR effort in Basra, currently co&#8209;ordinated from the PJCC, where </p>
<p>100 UK troops and seven UK police advisers were based. The threat to those staff </p>
<p>if there were no significant MND(SE) presence at the Basra Palace site would be </p>
<p>impossibly high because “there would be no quick way to get reinforcements to the site </p>
<p>or to evacuate UK personnel in an emergency”. Officials concluded that a withdrawal </p>

<p>Office Erbil.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> Mr Frank Baker, Head of Iraq Group, advised Dr John Jenkins, FCO </p>
<p>Director Middle East and North Africa, that the British Embassy Office should remain </p>
<p>at the Khanzad Hotel despite concerns about security and value for money. Mr Baker </p>
<p>explained that the Khanzad office achieved a score well inside the “red zone” on the </p>
<p>FCO risk matrix. Staff in Erbil would continue to look for better short&#8209;term alternatives </p>
<p>while preparing the business case for a long&#8209;term presence in Erbil. </p>
<p><b>524. </b> Dr Jenkins advised Dr Kim Howells, Minister of State for the Middle East, and </p>
<p>Sir Peter Ricketts that it was “a tough call” whether to remain in Erbil:</p>
<p>“There is a serious duty of care issue. The costs of maintaining the consulate in </p>
<p>Erbil flow from this. On the other hand it does a serious job of work. The French are </p>
<p>looking to establish a mission there. My view is that we should accept the current </p>
<p>level of risk and maintain our presence while actively looking for other sites (which </p>
<p>may include co&#8209;location with the French).” </p>
<p><b>525. </b> In the first week of December, Sir Peter Ricketts visited Baghdad and  </p>

<p>General Operations.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>526. </b> On his return to London, Sir Peter advised Mr Miliband that the most important </p>
<p>issue to resolve was the future of the UK presence in Basra. Mr Brown, now </p>
<p>Prime Minister, had announced a continued UK military presence until late 2008 and </p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff, intended that the UK </p>
<p>military should leave soon after that. Mr Brown had also set a high level of ambition for </p>
<p>the UK contribution to economic regeneration, but the UK civilian presence was entirely </p>
<p>dependent on the military for security and life support. Sir Peter warned: “If the military </p>
<p>go, the civilians go, unless another very capable western military force replaces us.” </p>
<p>He also warned that the Basra PRT was small and there was “a sense of planning blight” </p>
<p>because of uncertainties beyond late 2008.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>338</p>
<p><b>527. </b> Without exaggerating the problem, Sir Peter also wanted Mr Miliband to be  </p>
<p>aware of: </p>
<p>“… tensions under the surface between some on the UK military side (more </p>
<p>[Lieutenant] General [William] Rollo [Senior British Military Representative – Iraq] </p>
<p>in Baghdad than [Major] General [Graham] Binns [GOC MND(SE)] in Basra)… who </p>
<p>think that the civilians are moving too slowly and unimaginatively, and the UK PRT </p>
<p>in Basra who feel that they have been turned on a sixpence from an expectation of </p>
<p>closing down in the Spring of 2008 to a series of big new expectations, but not much </p>
<p>more resources to deliver them. Des Browne has picked up this military view.”</p>
<p><b>528. </b> Separately, Sir Peter Ricketts suggested to Mr Baker that improving conditions </p>
<p>in Baghdad, though not Basra, called for a reassessment of policy on the length of </p>
<p>postings.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> Many staff were highly motivated and able to cope with an extra six months, </p>
<p>if not a second year: “Quite a head of steam is building up on this issue and it needs to </p>
<p>be tackled.” Sir Peter also reported that Mr Christopher Prentice, British Ambassador </p>
<p>to Iraq, had made a persuasive case for an increase in staff numbers as prospects </p>
<p>improved and the pace of work began to increase. </p>
<p><b>529. </b> Mr Miliband visited Baghdad, Basra and Erbil from 16 to 18 December.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> On </p>
<p>return, he commented to Mr Brown: “I was struck in talking to members of our locally </p>
<p>engaged staff in Baghdad how fearful for the future they remain – and how much they </p>
<p>have personally borne and continue to bear.”</p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Miliband was impressed by staff morale and the positive “can&#8209;do” attitude in all </p>
<p>three UK posts. He suggested to Mr Brown that: “We should think about reflecting the </p>
<p>role of our civilian staff more widely in future statements on Iraq to Parliament.”</p>
<p><b>531. </b> Mr Tinline sent an annual review for the Basra PRT to the US Embassy in Baghdad </p>
<p>on 19 December.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> He reported that:</p>
<p>“<b>Keeping going</b> has been a huge challenge. The team spent three months </p>
<p>crammed four to an 8 metre x 2 metre pod and seven months under increasingly </p>
<p>heavy rocket attack … And for most of the year we did not know whether we would </p>
<p>still be in Basra in six months’ time. The burden has been greatest on our local </p>
<p>staff. Our legal assistant was killed in April, followed by his father the week after </p>
<p>he attended one of our legal training events. Others have been threatened. They </p>
<p>appreciate that the British assistance scheme [for LE staff] explicitly includes them. </p>
<p>Throughout the spirit and support within the whole team has been tremendous.”</p>
<p><b>532. </b> Mr Tinline added that one challenge lying ahead was putting staff on a “sustainable </p>
<p>long term footing (several members have already done two years and we are carrying </p>
<p>some gaps on the rule of law side)”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>340</p>
<p><b>541. </b> In March 2009, with the departure of the DFID Head of the PRT and the transition </p>
<p>to US leadership, DFID authority for moves off the COB was transferred to the Head of </p>
<p>DFID Baghdad.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>542. </b> Comments from witnesses who served in Iraq reinforced the impression of slowly </p>
<p>improving transport provision.</p>
<p><b>543. </b> Mr Tansley, Consul General in Basra from October 2005 to April 2006, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry: “The thing that dominated our lives, was not money and people. It was </p>
<p>helicopters.” </p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Mr Asquith,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>British Ambassador to Iraq from August 2006 to August 2007, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that transport constraints inhibited movement between Baghdad and Basra:</p>
<p>“Not merely was it difficult to get down there, since we were dependent, at that </p>
<p>stage, upon helicopter trips out of Baghdad to the airport and then to Basra, and </p>
<p>the military facilities weren’t always ready for that … </p>
<p>“It was also difficult to move around Basra …” </p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>545. </b> Ms Kathleen Reid, Head of DFID Basra from August 2007 to September 2008, </p>
<p>explained that: </p>
<p>“[Major] General [Barney] White&#8209;Spunner [GOC MND(SE)] … made a commitment </p>
<p>… that they were there to support. Whatever we needed in terms of assets, he </p>
<p>would make that happen, and I have to say, always came good on that …” </p>
<p>359</p>
<p><b>546. </b> Mr Prentice, British Ambassador from September 2007 to November 2009, stated:</p>
<p>“… if we wanted to get to Basra, we needed to have a military asset. Under our </p>
<p>duty of care regulations, we couldn’t use the emerging commercial flights, which </p>
<p>towards the end of my period were available … So we had to depend on helicopters </p>
<p>and military lift. But during my time we also had use of US civilian aircraft through </p>
<p>the US Embassy. They kindly made those available to us occasionally. So physical </p>
<p>movement to and from Basra I would say was improving during my time but was </p>
<p>still difficult.” </p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>547. </b> In October 2008, FCO officials started to consider the future of the UK’s network  </p>
<p>of posts in Iraq after the military drawdown in 2009.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p> The preferred option was to </p>
<p>maintain the status quo in Baghdad and Erbil, with a reduced presence in Basra, in </p>
<p>order to strike “the right balance between strategic policy delivery requirements and </p>
<p>financial pressures”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>15.1  |  Civilian personnel</p>
<p>341</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts supported that conclusion “from the perspective of our relations </p>
<p>with Iraq”, but asked that FCO Ministers be given the opportunity to “consider the relative </p>
<p>importance of continuing very high levels of FCO spending in Iraq as against other </p>
<p>priorities”.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p> Decisions should not be pre&#8209;empted by Whitehall processes before that </p>
<p>had happened. The FCO’s corporate systems were “not well developed for making those </p>
<p>decisions about relative priorities across the network”, but there would be an opportunity </p>
<p>for the Board to look at the issue later at the end of November.</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Sir Peter was “struck by the extremely high cost of maintaining a presence in Erbil”. </p>
<p>He did not believe it was possible to justify on value for money grounds a large capital </p>
<p>investment in the city. If the UK was to remain, it had to be on the basis of co&#8209;location </p>
<p>with another EU country.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> On Basra, Sir Peter expressed scepticism about what a very small post, with </p>
<p>declining interest from other departments, could achieve. Ministers needed to be given </p>
<p>the option of closure. If they would not accept that, the FCO should review after  </p>
<p>12 months whether staff had been able to make any difference in Basra. </p>
<p><b>551. </b> Officials informed Mr Miliband on 8 December that the FCO Board had decided </p>
<p>on 28 November that Ministers should be presented with two options for Basra: a </p>
<p>mini&#8209;mission within a secure US military perimeter, to be reviewed again in 2009, or </p>
<p>closure when UK forces left.</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> There was a strong case from a policy perspective for </p>
<p>retaining the post, but Ministers would want to consider value for money in the light </p>
<p>of wider cost pressures. Mr Brown and DFID and Department of Energy and Climate </p>
<p>Change (DECC) Ministers were thought to be in favour of keeping Basra open.</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Officials explained that NSID(OD)</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> would discuss Iraq and Afghanistan on  </p>
<p>9 December, but that there would not be time for substantive discussion of the </p>
<p>post&#8209;drawdown Iraq strategy. Mr Brown would invite Mr Miliband to seek agreement  </p>
<p>by correspondence.</p>

<p>“FCO will retain a substantial Embassy in Baghdad at roughly current levels  </p>
<p>(20&#8209;25 FCO UK&#8209;based staff), a small post in Erbil (4 UK staff – to be reviewed again </p>
<p>in March 2009); and – subject to Ministers’ views – a small post in Basra (3&#8209;4 UK </p>
<p>staff, down from 9 at present) until at least March 2010. Non&#8209;staff running costs in </p>

<p><b>555. </b> On 13 January 2009, Mr Miliband’s Private Office circulated a draft strategy for </p>
<p>“UK policy towards and relations with Iraq following military drawdown”.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p> It had been </p>
<p>agreed by officials from all interested departments and by Mr Miliband. </p>
<p><b>556. </b> Annex C set out proposals for three posts in Baghdad, Basra and Erbil:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Baghdad. Any significant disengagement would reduce the UK’s influence and </p>
<p>be seen as an acknowledgement of failure. The FCO assessed that the security </p>
<p>situation allowed road moves between the Embassy and the airport, rather than </p>
<p>the RAF helicopter air bridge, but that Iraqiisation of security in the International </p>
<p>Zone from 2009 would require additional investment in security measures.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra. The FCO did not believe it would be cost&#8209;effective to maintain the same </p>
<p>level of civilian presence after the departure of UK combat forces. The US was </p>
<p>likely to become the public face of the Coalition in southern Iraq and the security </p>
<p>situation did not yet permit travel between Basra and the COB without military </p>
<p>assistance. The FCO proposed reducing the number of UK&#8209;based FCO staff </p>
<p>from nine to three or four; DFID would not keep resident staff in Basra after June </p>
<p>2009, but would pay the cost of two “virtual” slots to guarantee accommodation </p>
<p>for visiting staff.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Erbil. The policy case for retaining a UK presence was strong, but the cost per </p>
<p>head of operating in Erbil was extremely high and the location in the Khanzad </p>
<p>Hotel was not sustainable on security grounds. The FCO intended to work on </p>
<p>a more sustainable and cost&#8209;effective arrangement. </p>
<p><b>557. </b> Mr Alistair Darling (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), Mr John Hutton (the Defence </p>
<p>Secretary) and Mr Douglas Alexander (the International Development Secretary) all </p>
<p>agreed to the proposed strategy.</p>

<p> He reported to Dr Jenkins </p>
<p>that the security situation continued to improve:</p>
<p>“I spent a day driving around Basra, including a visit to a date farm outside the town </p>
<p>in an area we could not have thought of visiting even three months ago … The </p>
<p>improvement in security has been mirrored on the COB, where body armour is no </p>
<p>longer required to be carried while on the base.</p>
<p>“While it is true that the key enabler for recent progress was Charge of the Knights, </p>
<p>it was our reaction to those events which was critical. It would have been easy to </p>

<p><b>560. </b> An unattributed FCO review of lessons to be learned from the UK’s experience </p>
<p>in Basra from late 2008 included a number of observations on civilian personnel:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“FCO (and other civilian departments) need to build on the frameworks for risk </p>
<p>ownership and management which have been put in place over the last five </p>
<p>years to allow maximum operational flexibility on the ground consistent with our </p>
<p>duty of care, including through the provision at an early stage in the deployment </p>
<p>of protective assts eg armoured transport.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The FCO was unprepared for the sort of operation that was to be undertaken, </p>
<p>with the result that, in the early stages (but almost six months after the invasion) </p>
<p>FCO staff were being sent into the field without computers, communication </p>
<p>equipment, satisfactory communications arrangements (personal email accounts </p>
<p>were used throughout, though some classified communications became </p>
<p>available during 2004) and so on. Their military and DFID counterparts were </p>

<p><b>561. </b> Between 2003 and 2009, departments faced a range of difficulties recruiting </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of an established co&#8209;ordinating mechanism for UK civilian </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hostility in some departments to Iraq deployments; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq fatigue.</p>
<p><b>562. </b> In response to those constraints on recruitment:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government took steps to establish a UK cadre of deployable civilian </p>
<p>experts as part of a strategic review of the UK’s approach to stabilisation and </p>
<p>reconstruction. That process is addressed in Section 10.3.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Individual departments introduced a range of ad hoc incentives to volunteer. </p>
<p><b>563. </b> With the exception of problems associated with deploying volunteers from UK </p>
<p>police forces, addressed in detail in Section 12.1, the Inquiry has seen no indication that </p>
<p>difficulty attracting volunteers contributed to the delays in the deployment of UK civilians </p>
<p>to Iraq in the early months of the CPA.</p>
<p><b>564. </b> On 25 July 2003, Sir Michael Jay reported that, since his request for volunteers  </p>
<p>on 22 April, the Government had trained and deployed “over 100 civilian staff from </p>
<p>sixteen different branches of government”, an exercise he described as having </p>
<p>“no modern precedent”.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p><b>565. </b> A Treasury official recalled in mid&#8209;2004 that he had been very impressed by  </p>
<p>the turnout at an early meeting in the Treasury for people thinking of volunteering to </p>
<p>go to Iraq:</p>
<p>“We had some 60 or so people arrive for that meeting – a very high quality response </p>
<p>– in fact such a good response that we couldn’t meet everyone’s desire to go out to </p>
<p>Iraq at that point.” </p>
<p>373</p>
<p><b>566. </b> By autumn 2003, as Ministerial pressure to deploy greater numbers of civilians </p>
<p>grew, departments faced increasing difficulty attracting volunteers. Ministers and officials </p>
<p>considered a range of incentives to aid recruitment.</p>
<p><b>567. </b> The AHMGIR on 6 November 2003 discussed the need for CPA(South) to be </p>
<p>staffed “properly and quickly” and requested a report on recruitment.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>568. </b> Mr Desmond Bowen, Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat (OD Sec), advised:</p>
<p>“It has not proved easy to recruit staff to serve in Iraq, despite financial inducements. </p>
<p>Successful candidates need to have the right technical skills, aptitude for building </p>
<p>Iraqi capacity and willingness to work in a difficult environment.” </p>

<p>345</p>
<p><b>569. </b> Mr Bowen reported that: “Extracting people from current jobs, security training and </p>
<p>the logistics of deployment often take longer than we would want.” </p>
<p><b>570. </b> In November 2003, the FCO Iraq Operations Unit (IOU) advised Sir Michael Jay </p>
<p>that recruitment and succession planning were “difficult”.</p>
<p>376</p>
<p> A number of volunteers had </p>
<p>dropped out in recent weeks. Staffing requirements were “just about manageable” but </p>
<p>would become more difficult if security deteriorated. </p>
<p><b>571. </b> At a meeting with Sir Michael Jay on 25 November, Sir Hilary Synnott reported </p>
<p>vacancies in “key areas” in Basra and advised that, unless there was “a more positive </p>
<p>approach to recruitment, the whole policy risked failure”.</p>
<p>377</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>572. </b> Sir Hilary reported that he had discussed the issue with Mr Straw, who had </p>
<p>suggested that “the [FCO] administration (and by extension other departments in </p>
<p>Whitehall) should try to encourage people by pointing out the career advantages”. </p>
<p>Sir Hilary had suggested paying people more. </p>
<p><b>573. </b> Sir Michael Jay told Sir Hilary Synnott there were drawbacks to those proposals:</p>
<p>“The strong view hitherto in Whitehall had been that all postings to Iraq should be </p>
<p>volunteers. Andrew Turnbull had also taken the view that we should not try to pay </p>
<p>people the market rate to get them there. This would work for the private sector, </p>
<p>but not for us with our duty of care to staff, which was uppermost in the minds of </p>
<p>a number of my Permanent Secretary colleagues … It was important to maintain </p>
<p>Whitehall solidarity if possible.” </p>
<p><b>574. </b> On 5 December, Sir Hilary Synnott advised that recruitment had been made more </p>
<p>difficult by “the widely held perception that secondment to Basra might involve danger, </p>
<p>discomfort and long hours with little reward (although seen from here, some of these </p>
<p>concerns are exaggerated)”.</p>
<p>378</p>
<p> Sir Hilary expressed sympathy with the view put in </p>
<p>London that imprecise and changing job descriptions presented an additional obstacle, </p>
<p>but argued that tasks could not be defined until there was an expert on the ground:</p>
<p>“We should not become mesmerised by job descriptions. The main thing is to have </p>
<p>relatively expert people on the ground in sufficient numbers and quickly. Resourceful </p>
<p>officers will find plenty to do for themselves. Contracts need to be sufficiently flexible </p>
<p>to allow for this.”</p>
<p><b>575. </b> In his valedictory on 26 January 2004, Sir Hilary Synnott expressed frustration at </p>
<p>the slow deployment of staff, complicated by the short tours which constantly led to gaps </p>
<p>between appointments:</p>
<p>“… it was brought home to me that officials could not be deployed like the military, </p>
<p>despite notional mobility obligations; that the contracting processes to employ </p>

<p>training which was only intermittently available; and that, crucially, departments’ duty </p>
<p>of care constrained recruitment … [I]n these circumstances, “as fast as possible” </p>
<p>was simply not fast enough.” </p>
<p>379</p>
<p><b>576. </b> In his memoir, Sir Hilary described the shortage of human resources and expertise </p>
<p>as “the greatest single deficiency of our civilian operation”:</p>
<p>“It is now clear that there were two main reasons for this. Partly it was a result of </p>
<p>the excessive priority which was, and still is, placed on the security of civilian public </p>
<p>servants … </p>
<p>“But a more fundamental reason for the short supply of personnel and other </p>
<p>resources stemmed from a lack of political direction … The Army could, as always, </p>
<p>be relied upon to find solutions for themselves, albeit cut according to their </p>
<p>overstretched means. But in the civilian domain, Blair’s exhortations and verbal </p>
<p>commitments were not reflected in exceptional measures such as identifying and </p>
<p>encouraging volunteers by means of trawls of Embassies around the world, fast&#8209;track </p>
<p>recruitment procedures, or new management and co&#8209;ordination systems across </p>
<p>government departments.” </p>

<p><b>577. </b> Mr James Tansley, Consul General in Basra from October 2005 to April 2006, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Under our current terms and conditions of service you can’t tell someone in the </p>

<p>policy. No matter how you present it, being told you are going to be sitting in a </p>

<p><b>580. </b> Mr Tim Foy, Head of DFID Iraq from August 2005 to August 2006, told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Generally speaking, I think we did reasonably well in terms of acquiring core staff </p>
<p>from DFID, certainly in the early years. I think it’s got progressively harder as the </p>
<p>engagement has progressed because the lustre of going has gone there.” </p>
<p>383</p>
<p><b>581. </b> The recruitment of UK police officers for deployment to Iraq faced additional </p>
<p>obstacles.</p>
<p><b>582. </b> CC Kernaghan, holder of the International Affairs portfolio for the Association of </p>
<p>Chief Police Officers (ACPO) from 2001 to 2008, told the Inquiry that the impact of a </p>
<p>posting to Iraq on police officers’ careers had been a significant obstacle to effective </p>
<p>recruitment and deployment. He had considered it his responsibility to point out to </p>
<p>potential recruits that Iraq might not be a good career move.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>583. </b> CC Kernaghan added that the police experience had not been entirely negative. </p>
<p>After a while, the positive testimonies of returning officers had started to encourage </p>
<p>potential recruits: “I actually found it marginally easier to deploy people. They were not </p>
<p>affected by the big picture.” </p>
<p><b>584. </b> Former Chief Superintendent Dick Barton, UK Chief Police Adviser in Iraq from </p>
<p>2006 to 2007, told the Inquiry that “it was made quite clear to me that there were no </p>
<p>guarantees regarding postings or jobs on my return”.</p>
<p>385</p>
<p><b>585. </b> The resource cost to the contributing police force was also a constraint </p>
<p>on recruitment. ACC Smith told the Inquiry: “Some forces, particularly the larger </p>
<p>metropolitan, refused to allow serving officers to deploy.” </p>
<p>386</p>
<p><b>586. </b> Government departments took a number of steps to encourage staff to volunteer </p>
<p>for Iraq, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>financial allowances;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decompression breaks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assistance with post&#8209;Iraq job placements; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>temporary promotion.</p>
<p><b>587. </b> Incentives to attract UK volunteers were not introduced uniformly across </p>
<p>government. Differences in the terms and conditions applied by different organisations </p>
<p>persisted throughout the Iraq campaign. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>588. </b> In November 2003, FCO officials started to consider additional incentives to attract </p>
<p>the growing number of volunteers needed to fill civilian roles in Iraq and to be able to </p>
<p>replace them every few months for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p><b>589. </b> On 3 November 2003, the IOU informed Sir Michael Jay that civil service </p>
<p>secondees in Iraq received allowances worth about £1,500 a month, depending </p>
<p>on grade.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p> By comparison, FCO and DFID contractors earned up to £1,000 a day. </p>
<p>The IOU advised:</p>
<p>“There is no sign, yet, that money is a significant factor in finding civil service </p>
<p>volunteers for Iraq. But we may have to consider some improvement in the financial </p>
<p>terms if we find it increasingly difficult to recruit the civil service staff we need over </p>
<p>the next few months.”</p>
<p><b>590. </b> DFID’s November 2004 ‘Guide to Overseas Terms and Conditions for Long&#8209;term </p>
<p>Assignments in Iraq’ explained:</p>
<p>“DFID’s work in Iraq is very high profile and has assumed major corporate </p>
<p>importance. Working in Iraq is dangerous and the conditions are difficult. We need </p>
<p>staff with appropriate skills, e.g. programme management, and a high degree of </p>
<p>self&#8209;motivation to carry out this work. So, we have devised a package of allowances </p>
<p>and benefits specifically to attract such people and meet their needs.” </p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>591. </b> The details provided covered financial, travel and leave entitlements, health care, </p>
<p>insurance, accommodation and security.”</p>
<p><b>592. </b> Hardship allowances for Iraq were said to be high compared with other countries, </p>
<p>at £26,900 per annum in November 2004.</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event who served in Iraq between </p>
<p>mid&#8209;2004 and mid&#8209;2007 viewed the financial package available to civilians positively, </p>
<p>but expressed some resentment towards “overpaid” private sector contractors on </p>
<p>“extraordinary” daily rates.</p>
<p><b>594. </b> In 2003 the FCO introduced the “Golden Ticket” for staff deployed to Iraq for three </p>
<p>months or longer.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p> The Golden Ticket gave the holder priority over other applicants </p>
<p>when applying for their next job. It remained valid until a substantive job was secured.</p>
<p><b>595. </b> The November 2004 text of the standard letter issued to FCO staff posted to </p>
<p>diplomatic missions in Iraq stated: “HR and the wider Office value the contribution </p>
<p>you have made, and we hope that this will go some way to recognising that.” </p>

<p><b>596. </b> The Golden Ticket policy remained unchanged in 2005.</p>
<p>391</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>597. </b> An official from the FCO HR Directorate told Mr Asquith in June 2006 that staff </p>
<p>in Basra had asked whether the Golden Ticket really meant anything.</p>
<p>392</p>
<p> The official </p>
<p>had explained to staff that the ticket was not a guarantee of a dream posting but </p>
<p>“an added extra”. It was important that staff obtained timely, good quality appraisals </p>
<p>of their performance in Iraq to support job applications. </p>
<p><b>598. </b> The Golden Ticket was still on offer in January 2008, with an additional caveat:</p>
<p>“You will be able to ‘cash in’ your ticket when you next bid for jobs. A Golden Ticket </p>
<p>will give your bid priority over other officers’ bids<i> provided you are considered </i></p>
<p><i>equally credible in the job in other respects.</i>” </p>
<p>393</p>
<p><b>599. </b> In August 2008, an official in the FCO Human Resources Directorate informed </p>
<p>DFID that although the Golden Ticket had not been abolished formally, “we recognise </p>
<p>that it is increasingly difficult to deliver and the staff in post also recognise this”.</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>600. </b> Participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event who had been posted to Iraq </p>
<p>during the CPA period commented that some people had been “pressured” to volunteer </p>
<p>for tours in Iraq with the offer of a Golden Ticket, but nobody knew of anyone rewarded </p>
<p>with a favourable posting on their return. Some said they had not had jobs held open for </p>
<p>them during their absence because of cost&#8209;saving pressures. </p>
<p><b>601. </b> Members of the group also commented that many in their home departments did </p>
<p>not want to hear about their experiences on return from Iraq because of the negative </p>
<p>perceptions of the conflict in departments and the wider public.</p>
<p><b>602. </b> Participants who served in Iraq from mid&#8209;2004 to mid&#8209;2007 said that the career </p>
<p>impact of a posting to Iraq was often more negative than positive. There was a </p>
<p>perception that human resources departments did not recognise adequately the skills </p>
<p>acquired and that the career benefits had been oversold during recruitment. Some </p>
<p>returnees felt their departments saw them as something of a problem. The MOD was </p>
<p>a notable exception, where skills had been recognised and there had been a positive </p>
<p>career impact.</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Some non&#8209;MOD participants also commented that performance in jobs following </p>
<p>an Iraq posting was often poor. Possible contributory factors included low motivation and </p>
<p>lack of understanding by subsequent managers of what staff had been through.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>604. </b> The Inquiry has seen evidence that temporary promotion was widely used in the </p>
<p>MOD as an additional incentive for recruitment of volunteers. </p>
<p><b>605. </b> In late 2007, Mr Jon Day, MOD Director General Operational Policy, commented </p>
<p>unfavourably on the large number of MOD civilians given “T&amp;G [temporary and </p>
<p>geographical] promotion well above their grade”.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p><b>606. </b> Participants at the civilian outreach event suggested that, between 2007 and 2009, </p>
<p>it had become more difficult to recruit suitable candidates. There was concern that </p>
<p>availability rather than suitability became the deciding factor, and that some posts had </p>
<p>been overgraded to attract applicants.</p>
<p><b>607. </b> The US also experienced difficulty filling positions in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>608. </b> In June 2004, the US General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that the CPA </p>
<p>“had generally operated with about one&#8209;third of its direct positions vacant”.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> Reasons </p>
<p>suggested for the shortfall included the hardship of the posting, the security situation </p>
<p>and budgetary constraints.</p>
<p><b>609. </b> The RAND history of the CPA stated that the CPA suffered severe shortages of </p>
<p>trained and experienced personnel throughout its existence, with a number of sectors, </p>
<p>including police and justice, “chronically undermanned”.</p>
<p>397 </p>
<p>Contributory factors included </p>
<p>rapid staff turnover, the CPA’s inability to keep track of the staff it had, and its failure </p>
<p>to identify requirements still to be met.</p>
<p><b>610. </b> In January 2006, the Office of the Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction </p>
<p>concluded that a number of circumstances had inhibited effective workforce  </p>
<p>planning, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the wide&#8209;ranging role of the CPA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the CPA’s temporary status;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>

<p><b>Seniority</b></p>
<p><b>611. </b> Ministers and officials frequently expressed concern about the difficulties faced by </p>
<p>the UK in deploying the right people to positions where they would be able to exert UK </p>
<p>influence in a US&#8209;dominated environment and achieve lasting impact in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>612. </b> The issue arose in a number of different contexts. It appears not to have been </p>
<p>addressed systematically. </p>
<p><b>613. </b> The appointment of Major General Tim Cross as the senior UK member of ORHA </p>
<p>in February 2003 is addressed earlier in this Section. </p>
<p><b>614. </b> Section 9.2 describes the appointment of his successor, Mr Andy Bearpark.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> In the Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR on 22 May 2003, officials advised that </p>
<p>Mr Bearpark needed to be given the right job to “maximise UK influence in ORHA”.</p>
<p>399</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>616. </b> Mr Bearpark was subsequently appointed CPA Director of Operations and </p>
<p>Infrastructure. He arrived in Baghdad on 16 June.</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Section 9.2 describes how, although UK officials in Whitehall regarded Mr Bearpark </p>
<p>as the UK’s senior representative in the CPA, Mr Bearpark saw his primary loyalty as </p>
<p>lying with the CPA and Ambassador Bremer. </p>
<p><b>618. </b> Several weeks after Mr Bearpark’s arrival in Baghdad, the Government agreed that </p>
<p>a senior UK figure should be appointed to head CPA(South).</p>
<p><b>619. </b> On 10 July, the AHMGIR agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secondments to the CPA should be maintained at “approximately the current </p>
<p>level”, but matched more closely to requirements, with more specialist than </p>
<p>policy staff.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK effort in CPA(South) should be increased “as required”, including through </p>
<p>the appointment of a “suitably strong UK figure” to replace Ambassador Olsen.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p><b>620. </b> On 11 July 2003, Ms Hewitt advised Mr Blair of the need “to ensure that we are </p>
<p>seconding sufficiently senior people to the CPA”. It was noticeable that the US was </p>
<p>sending more senior people than the UK.</p>
<p>401</p>
<p><b>621. </b> Shortly afterwards, the IPU put forward recommendations for CPA staffing  </p>
<p>based on the principle that the UK should seek to exert influence at “all levels”.  </p>
<p>These included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>filling gaps, including at a senior level, in UK coverage of SSR, the economic </p>

<p>Representative on Iraq, commented that the UK “has not yet put the intensity of </p>
<p>resources into the civilian side of our operation, in terms of both personnel and </p>
<p>project money, to convince the Americans that our analysis … has to be listened to” </p>
<p>(see Section 10.1).</p>
<p>405</p>
<p><b>625. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull and Mr O’Donnell discussed the seniority of UK secondees to </p>
<p>the CPA on 11 November.</p>
<p>406</p>
<p> They observed that the recent reorganisation of the CPA </p>
<p>(see Section 10.1) had left the UK with no UK officials at Director level and concluded </p>
<p>that: “It was difficult to continue to send staff as secondees if they were left with low level </p>
<p>roles only.”</p>
<p><b>626. </b> Although the Treasury and Bank of England deployed only junior officials to Iraq, </p>
<p>they were noticeably effective (see Section 10.1). </p>
<p><b>627. </b> A Treasury official speaking at a Treasury seminar in July 2004, said that securing </p>
<p>people with the right skills had been “paramount” in Iraq: </p>
<p>“… we didn’t have many people to deploy so we took care to second people who </p>
<p>could add value, and we are very fortunate in having a skill set within the Treasury </p>
<p>that was able to deploy effectively in the circumstances.” </p>
<p>407</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Seniority was not a guarantee of influence.</p>
<p><b>629. </b> In August 2003, officials informed Ministers that the UK was “seeking to engage the </p>

<p>408</p>
<p> Two “senior people” were joining the </p>
<p>CPA Oil Team, including Mr Terry Adams as the CPA Oil Technical Expert. The CPA </p>
<p>had welcomed Mr Adams’ appointment, but had been “less than enthusiastic” about the </p>
<p>second UK appointment.</p>
<p><b>630. </b> TPUK informed Mr Blair on 10 October that the DTI’s efforts to understand </p>
<p>and influence CPA policy on oil and gas had been “consistently unsuccessful” until </p>
<p>Mr Adams’ arrival. Mr Adams’ appointment had improved the DTI’s understanding to </p>
<p>some extent, although officials believed that the CPA had restricted Mr Adams’ access </p>
<p>to information and decision&#8209;making meetings.</p>
<p>409</p>
<p><b>631. </b> On 14 October Ministers were informed that Mr Adams was “routinely excluded </p>
<p>from some meetings”.</p>
<p>410</p>
<p><b>632. </b> A further instance of US resistance to senior UK appointments occurred in January </p>
<p>2004, when the Iraq Senior Officials Group concluded that, given the US lead in the </p>
<p>media sector, there was little scope for UK involvement, and that the US was resisting </p>
<p>the secondment of senior UK staff (see Section 10.1).</p>
<p>411</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>633. </b> At the end of January 2004, the US asked for UK help in staffing the Program </p>
<p>Management Office (PMO) that had been set up to oversee CPA reconstruction funds </p>
<p>(see Section 10.1).</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>634. </b> UKTI contracted two individuals to work in the PMO, initially for three months. </p>

<p>“We can claim indirect benefit to UK plc from these consultants, but it is difficult to </p>
<p>quantify any direct commercial benefit. PMO procurement still (rightly) has to go </p>
<p>through a full competitive process … But these consultancies have earned us a </p>
<p>great deal of goodwill from PMO senior management, ensured a UK voice at the </p>

<p>after the transfer of sovereignty in June 2004, “has declined our offer of a senior </p>
<p>reconstruction specialist but we are offering technical help instead” (see Section 10.2).</p>

<p><b>640. </b> Witnesses to the Inquiry offered contrasting views on the success of the UK’s effort </p>
<p>to deploy the right people to the right positions in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>641. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that the CPA generally received the people it </p>
<p>needed from the UK: </p>
<p><i>“</i>I think we did pretty well on that … [T]here was a sort of little bit of a generation </p>
<p>gap, perhaps inevitably, given the security circumstances, in that you got a large </p>
<p>tranche of relatively young people, because they were single and didn’t have </p>
<p>families and children to worry about … We also had quite senior people, whose </p>
<p>families had grown up, again less concerned. So there was sort of a missing middle </p>
<p>to some extent, but I think that’s probably inevitable in the situation.” </p>
<p>418</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>642. </b> Mr Bearpark was less sanguine. He highlighted the effect of the imbalance </p>
<p>between military and civilian numbers. Because civilians could not cover all the meetings </p>
<p>taking place each day that were relevant to their work, “99 military planners are going </p>
<p>away saying, ‘DFID is useless’ and only one of them is admitting that DFID does actually </p>
<p>know what it is talking about”. That systemic problem had been resolved very quickly in </p>
<p>Bosnia in 1994 and 1995: </p>
<p>“… whatever your limited civilian resource is … it must match exactly into where you </p>
<p>insert it into the military machine. If you can only afford one person, that person has </p>
<p>to be the equivalent of the Commanding General. If you can afford three people, you </p>
<p>can place them two ranks down, and if you can only afford one junior person, that </p>
<p>person must be on the personal staff of the Commanding General.” </p>

<p><b>643. </b> In his valedictory as Head of the IPU in May 2005, Mr Crompton criticised the </p>
<p>FCO’s “inability (or unwillingness)” to redeploy senior staff at short notice:</p>
<p>“In summer 2003 we carried short gaps in both Baghdad and Basra at critical times, </p>
<p>absences which damaged our reputation around Whitehall … If the FCO aspires </p>
<p>to be the lead on post&#8209;conflict issues, it needs to be willing to redeploy senior staff </p>
<p>immediately from other positions, leaving gaps if necessary.” </p>
<p>420</p>
<p><b>644. </b> Mr Tinline, who served in Basra from 2007 to 2008, told the Inquiry that recruitment </p>
<p>was less of a concern than it might have been because of the security situation:</p>
<p>“… if the security constraints had been less, I think a lot of these things would </p>
<p>have been far bigger issues. Because the security constraints were such, we didn’t </p>
<p>actually need that much staff. We couldn’t actually do that much. So the sort of lost </p>

<p>“So in many ways it was a certain sort of person who would have enjoyed his time or </p>

<p>Foreign Office could have come up with another Arabist. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“As I said, I think we could have had more impact in terms of personnel if we had </p>

<p><b>650. </b> Mr Nigel Heywood, Consul General in Basra from April 2008 to August 2009, told </p>

<p>engaged political adviser who acted as interpreter.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p> Mr Heywood suggested that there </p>
<p>was a competitive advantage to be gained from having Arabists in an environment like </p>
<p>Iraq, where other countries did not have any on their staff.</p>
<p><b>651. </b> Mr MacKiggan, Head of the Basra PRT from 2008 to 2009, did not speak Arabic, </p>
<p>and worked through interpreters.</p>
<p>425</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry that it was necessary to prioritise </p>
<p>skills and that it was difficult to find the person who had all the skills you were looking </p>
<p>for in an environment like Iraq. </p>
<p><b>652. </b> Shortage of Arabic language skills was also a consistent theme among participants </p>
<p>at the Inquiry civilian outreach event.</p>

<p> The event raised concerns about the shortage of Arabic speakers in </p>
<p>a range of institutions, including the FCO, and the decline in the teaching of Middle </p>
<p>Eastern studies and languages in the UK. Some Middle Eastern languages, including </p>
<p>Kurdish, were not being taught at all in the UK. Participants warned that, when money </p>
<p>was tight, language teaching was often the first area to suffer. </p>

<p>357</p>
<p><b>656. </b> In 2011, Mr William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, told the Foreign Affairs </p>
<p>Committee (FAC) inquiry into the role of the FCO in UK government that he wanted </p>
<p>language expertise and regional knowledge to be “re&#8209;accentuated” in the FCO.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>657. </b> Two witnesses to the FAC inquiry argued that there was a disjuncture between </p>
<p>Mr Hague’s emphasis on language skills for UK diplomats and decisions to cut </p>
<p>government support for the teaching of modern languages in UK universities.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p><b>658. </b> Dr Christian Turner, FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, informed the FAC </p>
<p>that the FCO had taken a number of steps to improve Arabic language skills:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>restoration of the length of full time Arabic training to 18 months;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more opportunities for staff in London to learn Arabic and maintain existing  </p>
<p>skills; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a 40 percent increase in “Arabic speaker capacity” in Middle East and North </p>
<p>Africa posts compared to 2010.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p><b>659. </b> In its 2012 report on British foreign policy and the Arab Spring, the FAC concluded </p>
<p>that the FCO had “significantly degraded” its language capacity by 2010, but had since </p>
<p>recognised the need to improve Arabic language skills.</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>660. </b> At the opening of the new FCO language school on 19 September 2013, Mr Hague </p>
<p>described expertise in a foreign language as “one of the fundamental skills of our </p>
<p>diplomats”: </p>
<p>“It makes them vastly more effective at communicating the viewpoint of the United </p>
<p>Kingdom. And it is vital to understanding the political mood in different countries and </p>
<p>to spotting trends or anticipating crises.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“It helps us, for example to identify and influence individuals and groups playing a </p>
<p>significant part in shaping events, such as in the context of the Arab spring. Arabic is </p>
<p>the fastest growing language on social media platforms globally, and we need good </p>
<p>language skills to tap into this rich conversation and to put across the UK position.</p>
<p>“Language skills are invaluable when trying to understand and predict the behaviour </p>
<p>of countries that do not have transparent, democratic political systems, and where </p>
<p>reliable information is harder to come [by] but vitally important to British companies </p>

<p>“With 40 classrooms we have space here to train up to 1,000 full and part&#8209;time </p>
<p>language students over the course of 12 months, in up to 80 different languages </p>
<p>from Arabic to Zulu. We will be offering 70,000 hours of teaching each year, not </p>
<p>just for the men and women of the Foreign Office, but to those of other government </p>
<p>departments if they wish to take advantage of our services.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“So we are also increasing the number of jobs overseas for which language skills </p>
<p>are required in key parts of our overseas network. We’ve brought in a 20 percent </p>
<p>increase in the number of posts for speakers of Latin American Spanish, Portuguese </p>
<p>and Arabic, and a 40 percent increase in the number of Mandarin speakers.” </p>
<p>432</p>
<p><b>661. </b> In his speech, Mr Hague described the new language facility as just one part </p>
<p>of “the biggest drive to enhance the diplomatic skills of the Foreign Office that the </p>
<p>department has ever seen”. A stronger culture of learning and expertise was part of </p>
<p>a “quiet revolution” that included “a greater emphasis on history and the retention and </p>
<p>sharing of knowledge and expertise”. Changes included moving the FCO’s historians </p>
<p>“back into the heart of the Foreign Office” and attaching greater importance to the work </p>
<p>of Research Analysts. </p>

<p> General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, </p>

<p>to establish the exact requirement and where the linguists might be found. </p>
<p><b>665. </b> In December 2003, MOD officials informed Lt Gen Fry that, in addition to “tactical </p>

<p>436</p>

<p><b>666. </b> Officials explained that the search for Arabic speakers across the three services </p>
<p>had exhausted the pool of suitably qualified regular soldiers, and the mobilisation </p>
<p>of reserves had exhausted the pool of linguists in the Territorial Army (TA). Training </p>
<p>individuals to the level required for the 39 core posts took 10&#8209;12 months. </p>
<p><b>667. </b> MOD officials explained that allocating 18 of the 39 posts to civilians offered a </p>
<p>partial solution, but there was still a need to fill the remaining 21 posts every six months </p>
<p>for the foreseeable future. Proposals included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an increase in the provision of training by the Defence School of Languages;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expansion of the pool of TA linguists;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further civilianisation;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>commitment to the CPA; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>redeployment of Arabic&#8209;speaking Defence and Military Attachés at British </p>

<p><b>672. </b> In 2013, the growing recognition of the importance of language skills was reflected </p>
<p>in the opening of the new Defence School of Language and Culture 2013.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>673. </b> The British Academy’s 2013 report on the need for languages in UK diplomacy and </p>
<p>security attributed the MOD’s change of approach directly to lessons learned in the Iraq </p>
<p>and Afghanistan campaigns. </p>
<p><b>674. </b> Both the FCO and the Armed Forces failed to anticipate or prepare for the surge </p>
<p>in demand for Arabic speakers in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>675. </b> In its 2013 report, the British Academy described some of the steps taken by </p>
<p>the MOD to generate language capacity quickly, but stated that, of the organisations </p>
<p>consulted, only the secret intelligence agencies appreciated the need for and difficulty </p>
<p>of ensuring sustainability of supply and surge capacity, especially for rare languages.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>676. </b> The British Academy added that there appeared to be “little co&#8209;ordination across </p>
<p>government to identify language needs and no overall strategic approach to enable </p>
<p>future needs to be met.” The report proposed more flexible working across departments, </p>
<p>allowing staff with language skills to be seconded for specific projects, such as engaging </p>
<p>with hard to reach groups. The new FCO language centre was identified as a significant </p>
<p>opportunity for pooling resources.</p>
<p><b>Tour length and continuity</b></p>
<p><b>677. </b> The difficult working conditions for civilians in Iraq were reflected in short </p>
<p>tour lengths and frequent leave breaks. Different departments adopted different </p>

<p><b>680. </b> An initial tour length of three months for the first wave of secondees to the CPA </p>
<p>was extended to six months in July 2003.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p><b>681. </b> The FCO pre&#8209;deployment letter for November 2004 stated that: “In light of the </p>
<p>dangers and discomforts a posting to Iraq is six months with the option of a further </p>
<p>six months thereafter.” </p>
<p>447</p>
<p> In addition to the FCO’s normal and overseas leave, staff </p>
<p>would be entitled to an extra 10 days’ leave each year. </p>
<p><b>682. </b> DFID’s November 2004 ‘Guide to Overseas Terms and Conditions for Long&#8209;term </p>
<p>Assignments in Iraq’ explained that DFID postings were for up to 12 months with a rota </p>
<p>of six weeks on, two weeks off, away from Iraq.</p>
<p>448</p>
<p><b>683. </b> In April 2005, the MOD considered introducing longer tours to mitigate some of </p>
<p>the effects of the short tour length (six months with a 10&#8209;day break half way through).</p>
<p>449</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Richard Hatfield, MOD Personnel Director, reported that many MOD staff in Iraq </p>
<p>were willing to do a second tour, or suggesting that slightly longer tours might be more </p>
<p>effective, if more difficult to sell to potential volunteers. Mr Hatfield recognised the </p>
<p>possible advantages of longer tours, particularly where continuity or local knowledge </p>
<p>was at a premium. He proposed that the MOD take “a slightly more ‘mix and match’ </p>
<p>approach about tour patterns, taking account of both the individual’s circumstances/</p>
<p>desires and the nature of the post”.</p>

<p>to its staff, and will keep those measures under constant review. This is a volunteer </p>

<p>“Extensions beyond 12 months are rare and only granted if there are compelling </p>
<p>operational reasons.” </p>

<p><b>687. </b> Staff were not permitted to bid for consecutive jobs in Iraq and/or Afghanistan </p>
<p>with a combined duration of over 12 months “while these posts are at a security level </p>
<p>warranting close protection teams and decompression breaks”. </p>
<p><b>688. </b> The 2008 terms and conditions also stated that the length and frequency of </p>
<p>decompression breaks were linked to the security situation and could change during a </p>
<p>posting. The interval between decompression breaks was set at between six and seven </p>
<p>weeks. In special circumstances, staff could seek authority to spend eight weeks at post </p>
<p>without a break. </p>
<p><b>689. </b> The Inquiry received a range of views on the merits of different models.</p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr MacKiggan, Head of the Basra PRT from 2008 to 2009, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think nine to 12 months should be the norm, perhaps even the minimum, because </p>
<p>it takes time to develop relationships … It is partly relationships with … locals … </p>
<p>It is also about relationships between different parts of government.” </p>
<p>453</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>691. </b> Mr Tansley endorsed the MOD model: </p>
<p><i>“</i>Comparing terms and conditions of service between the FCO and the political </p>
<p>advisers who were attached to MND(South East), I would have preferred  </p>
<p>perhaps an arrangement that the POLADs had, which I thought was more effective </p>
<p>than what the FCO was doing, both in terms of the level on health and safety </p>
<p>reasons, what they could and could not do, in terms of how often they had their </p>
<p>decompression breaks.” </p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>692. </b> All three working groups at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event debated the  </p>
<p>merits of different tour lengths, including the impact on civilian&#8209;military relations, </p>
<p>business continuity, relationships with external partners and the impact on individuals </p>
<p>and their families.</p>
<p><b>693. </b> Participants who had served in Iraq during the CPA period commented that </p>
<p>12 months was the maximum time during which personnel could remain effective. </p>
<p>Six weeks on and two off (6+2) was seen as an effective model. Tours were complicated </p>

<p>by the difficulty of getting out of Iraq, resulting in people not taking their leave, and by </p>
<p>the shortage of staff to cover work while people were on leave. </p>
<p><b>694. </b> Those who had been in Iraq between mid&#8209;2004 and mid&#8209;2007 commented that </p>
<p>covering absences under the 6+2 model required a much higher degree of flexibility </p>
<p>than was normal for the civil service, and that two&#8209;week absences had a negative </p>
<p>impact on civilians’ credibility with external interlocutors, including the UK military. </p>
<p>6+2 had the advantage that it allowed those with families to deploy and made it possible </p>
<p>to sustain tours of one to two years, providing greater continuity than the six months </p>
<p>(with a one&#8209;week break) served by MOD civilians. </p>
<p><b>695. </b> There was also thought to have been an impact on relationships with Iraqi </p>
<p>interlocutors, who were frustrated with frequent and apparently ill&#8209;planned changes </p>
<p>of UK personnel. In some cases there was a suspicion that Iraqis had exploited the </p>
<p>situation, for example by misrepresenting what had been agreed previously.</p>
<p><b>696. </b> Some individuals who had been in Iraq from mid&#8209;2007 suggested that, at least </p>
<p>initially, departments were too rigid about tour lengths. Those wanting to extend beyond </p>
<p>12 months had been forced by their departments to return. Different tour lengths for </p>
<p>MOD civilians continued to inhibit business and the building of relationships during this </p>
<p>period. The group concluded that different jobs called for different tour lengths.</p>
<p><b>Learning operational lessons</b></p>
<p><b>697. </b> Between 2003 and 2009, departments debriefed some civilian staff returning from </p>
<p>Iraq in order to learn operational lessons from their experience. </p>
<p><b>698. </b> Departments took steps to improve the debriefing process, but do not appear to </p>
<p>have established a comprehensive or consistent approach. </p>
<p><b>699. </b> At the AHMGIR on 24 July 2003, Mr Straw asked the Cabinet Office and the IPU </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>364</p>
<p>to report to Ministers in November, drawing on responses to a questionnaire to be given </p>
<p>to secondees within a month of their return from Iraq.</p>
<p>458</p>
<p><b>703. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet on 27 November that he had spoken to some 60 UK staff </p>
<p>at CPA headquarters in Baghdad, whose “extraordinary stoicism”, commitment and </p>
<p>contribution should be recognised.</p>
<p>459</p>
<p> There was, however, a sense that staff from </p>
<p>departments that did not normally send people on overseas postings were not properly </p>
<p>appreciated by those departments, either while in Iraq or on their return. Mr Straw </p>
<p>asked colleagues to ensure Permanent Secretaries were “managing and supporting” </p>
<p>their seconded staff and suggested that regular contact should be maintained between </p>
<p>departmental top management and their secondees. </p>
<p><b>704. </b> On 1 December, Mr John Barker, a Director in the Cabinet Office Corporate </p>
<p>Development Group, updated Sir Andrew Turnbull on responses to the questionnaire </p>
<p>given to returning UK secondees to the CPA.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p> Mr Barker reported:</p>
<p>“So far we have only had eight questionnaires returned. Although they have raised </p>
<p>a small number of niggles for example in relation to visa problems in Kuwait delaying </p>
<p>travel arrangements and to difficulties in getting help to arrange flights home, the </p>
<p>overall response has been positive. Volunteers have enjoyed the experience, </p>
<p>learned from it, felt proud to have been involved, enjoyed the comradeship and will </p>
<p>be happy to recommend others to go out there. None of the questionnaires mention </p>
<p>concerns about treatment on return to their department.</p>
<p>“There may of course be people who have not let us know of difficulties …”</p>
<p><b>705. </b> Mr Barker proposed that Sir Andrew Turnbull write to Permanent Secretaries, </p>
<p>reminding them that:</p>
<p>“… colleagues are doing a splendid job in very trying circumstances and will </p>
<p>be developing their competences in many of the areas we would want them to. </p>
<p>We should ensure that their contribution is recognised and that they do not have </p>
<p>grounds for believing that their careers have suffered because of being there.”</p>
<p><b>706. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull wrote to Permanent Secretaries on 3 December.</p>
<p>461</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reported that Ministers greatly appreciated the “courage, persistence and </p>
<p>determination” of staff in Iraq and felt more could be done to recognise what they were </p>
<p>achieving:</p>
<p>“Please encourage your Human Resources and Communications teams to address </p>
<p>this, for example by generating reports for your house journals, sending messages </p>

<p><b>707. </b> In July 2004, after the disbanding of the CPA, the Treasury held a seminar to learn </p>

<p>462</p>
<p> Treasury and Bank of England secondees </p>
<p>to the CPA spoke at the seminar, which was attended by Mr Brown, Mr Boateng, </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay and Mr O’Donnell.</p>
<p><b>708. </b> After the seminar, Mr O’Donnell saw the secondees to the CPA “to talk about their </p>
<p>time there and the lessons we can have”.</p>
<p><b>709. </b> Several participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event said that the Inquiry’s </p>
<p>event was the first time they had been asked to talk about their experiences. Most </p>
<p>of those who had served in Iraq during the CPA period felt let down. They felt that </p>
<p>departments had not tried to make use of the knowledge they had acquired or to </p>
<p>bring them into strategy discussions. Most of the participants had not had a post&#8209;tour </p>
<p>debriefing. There was a feeling at the civilian outreach event that the Whitehall approach </p>
<p>to human resources, leaving individuals to look after themselves, was not appropriate for </p>
<p>this sort of expeditionary civilian deployment.</p>
<p><b>710. </b> After a visit to Iraq in April 2005, Mr Hatfield reported that the MOD needed:</p>
<p>“… to make more active use of operational veterans to sell the prospect of a </p>
<p>deployed tour to potential volunteers – their enthusiasm is catching and they are well </p>
<p>placed to supply answers about both the real and imaginary concerns people may </p>
<p>have about what is involved.” </p>

<p>“The Ambassador [Mr Chaplin] was … interested in our arrangements for debriefing </p>
<p>– which at present it seems the FCO do not do. I suspect that we need to be a bit </p>
<p>more systematic here, too. Debriefing is therapeutic as well as potentially informative </p>

<p><b>713. </b> Periodic efforts to synchronise approaches did not produce consistency across </p>
<p>departments. </p>
<p><b>714. </b> In October 2003, COBR commissioned an FCO&#8209;led review of training, security and </p>
<p>insurance for UK civilians serving in Iraq to “ensure that there is consistency across all </p>
<p>government departments seconding staff and consultants”.</p>

<p>organisations with secondees in Iraq on 11 November 2003.</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>716. </b> The paper stated that, before deployment to Iraq, staff from the FCO and other </p>
<p>government departments (excluding DFID), and individuals contracted by the FCO, </p>
<p>attended a security&#8209;focused training course at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation </p>
<p>Centre in Nottingham (Chilwell). The initial course included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Medical and dental examination</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inoculations</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence Brief</p>

<p>• </p>

<p><b>718. </b> The course also included a briefing by the FCO Iraq Directorate on working and </p>
<p>living conditions, including a “preliminary security briefing”. Modules on NBC, “Conduct </p>
<p>after Capture” and “Law of Armed Conflict” had been dropped. </p>
<p><b>719. </b> The paper stated that, when no course was available at Chilwell, secondees </p>
<p>attended an equivalent course provided by a private sector company. In a few cases, </p>
<p>including that of Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the requirement for pre&#8209;deployment training had </p>
<p>been “overridden”, but it was Iraq Directorate’s “firm policy to insist that all secondees </p>
<p>receive such training”.</p>

<p><b>720. </b> The paper also stated that the MOD arranged its own training and briefing. </p>
<p>For recent deployments, that had matched the FCO arrangements, although MOD staff </p>
<p>continued to receive NBC training. </p>
<p><b>721. </b> DFID training followed the same principles, but was provided by the private sector </p>
<p>because those courses were more frequent. </p>
<p><b>722. </b> The paper stated that debriefing of secondees on their return from Iraq indicated </p>
<p>that they received good preparation “now that some deficiencies in the Chilwell </p>
<p>course … have been dealt with”. Feedback from staff still in Iraq “confirms that the </p>
<p>training has been useful and appropriate”.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> Concerns about the Chilwell course resurfaced in the MOD in 2005. After visiting </p>
<p>Iraq in April 2005, Mr Hatfield reported that the course did not seem to be working: </p>
<p>“Apart from the cultural brief, hardly a good word was said about it. To be fair, it was </p>
<p>not designed for civil servants. As a result of my discussions with our Ambassador </p>
<p>[Mr Chaplin], I think the solution might be to join with the FCO who have their own </p>
<p>preparatory course.”</p>
<p><b>724. </b> In June 2006, the MOD established the Support to Operations (S2O) programme </p>
<p>in response to lessons learned from the deployment of civilians on Op TELIC.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>programme’s aim was “to develop a more capable deployable civilian workforce, to </p>
<p>reduce the risk to deployed civilian staff and to ensure MOD is meeting its duty of care </p>
<p>to those deployed”.</p>
<p><b>725. </b> S2O was designed as a “single portal” for all deployed civil servants and visitors to </p>
<p>operations, to ensure they had been adequately trained, were medically fit and had the </p>
<p>appropriate equipment before deployment.</p>
<p>467</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>728. </b> Mr Howard undertook to write to PJHQ about those issues.</p>
<p><b>729. </b> The Inquiry has not seen any further material addressing those issues. </p>
<p><b>730. </b> Participants at the civilian outreach event described the setting up of the </p>
<p>S2O programme as a significant turning point for the MOD, rectifying problems with </p>
<p>the previous system under which there had been no centralised unit for managing </p>
<p>MOD civilian deployments.</p>
<p><b>731. </b> Those deployed during the CPA period characterised training and the issuing </p>
<p>of personal security equipment as ad hoc, with practice varying between departments. </p>
<p>Several mentioned that military body armour was too big and heavy for people not used </p>
<p>to it, and compared it unfavourably with the lighter armour issued to the media and some </p>
<p>US civilians.</p>
<p><b>732. </b> Participants who served in Iraq between 2004 and 2007 described pre&#8209;posting </p>
<p>arrangements as ad hoc and haphazard. The MOD was felt to have performed better </p>
<p>than the FCO, particularly after the creation of S2O in 2006. FCO participants were </p>
<p>particularly critical of FCO workforce planning, including line managers’ responsibility </p>
<p>for recruiting their own staff, which did not work well when they were in theatre. </p>
<p><b>733. </b> Participants at the outreach event who had been in Iraq between 2007 and 2009 </p>
<p>saw no consistency in the pre&#8209;deployment preparation offered by different departments, </p>
<p>but commented that there had been improvements to the security course at Chilwell. </p>
<p><b>734. </b> Living conditions for personnel seconded to ORHA in April and May 2003 were </p>
<p>difficult. Maj Gen Cross told the Inquiry: </p>
<p><i>“</i>The reality was the living conditions [for ORHA personnel] were pretty atrocious, </p>
<p>and although somebody like myself who had done a number of operations was </p>
<p>relatively comfortable, for a lot of people just surviving was pretty hard work.” </p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>735. </b> As early as June 2003, concerns emerged that civilian personnel deployed to Iraq </p>
<p>were not prepared for the conditions they would encounter. </p>

<p>procedures for hostile environment training and medical clearance in response to </p>
<p>“concerns that some FCO personnel on posting to, or visiting, Iraq are not capable of </p>

<p>474</p>
<p> Officials agreed a number of procedural changes, </p>
<p>including new requirements that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the FCO Medical Examiner would confirm whether an officer was fit to go to Iraq </p>
<p>before, not after, the posting board made the appointment; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>was fit to deploy.</p>
<p><b>741. </b> On 26 February, Mr Robert Gibson, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy </p>

<p>“in liaison with Frontier Medical, Capita and HRD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Three months after completion of the tour, Capita interviewed the officer to </p>
<p>assess the impact of the posting.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>743. </b> The IPU explained that pre&#8209;posting procedures were “rigorously followed” for FCO </p>
<p>staff, but it had been “unable to confirm this to be the case … for other government </p>
<p>departments”. There had been a few cases where individuals the FCO would not </p>
<p>consider medically fit to serve in Iraq had arrived at post or medical teams had identified </p>
<p>their medical problems at post at the last minute. </p>
<p><b>744. </b> The IPU advised that the FCO did not have the resources to carry out medical </p>
<p>screening and hostile environment training for all government staff deployed to Iraq. </p>
<p>Instead it would:</p>
<p>“… write to those departments and contractors most concerned, setting out our </p>
<p>procedures and recommend that they either institute something similar or ensure </p>
<p>their staff sit the Offshore Operators Association Medical. This is a rigorous medical </p>
<p>required for staff working on oil rigs …”</p>
<p><b>745. </b> In June 2006, a member of the FCO HR Directorate briefed two Frontier Medical </p>
<p>staff in Basra on the FCO’s process for pre&#8209;posting medical clearance.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> During the </p>
<p>discussion, it emerged that concerns persisted about the fitness of some contractors </p>
<p>working for the FCO and other departments. The Frontier Medical staff also suggested </p>
<p>that non&#8209;FCO personnel should have to pass a medical similar to that required for FCO </p>
<p>staff as a condition of employment in Iraq. The FCO Iraq Directorate was reported to be </p>
<p>pursuing the issue.</p>
<p><b>746. </b> In July 2006, DFID officials explained to Mr Benn that, although DFID staff were </p>
<p>covered by FCO procedures in most areas, that was not the case for pre&#8209;deployment </p>
<p>procedures.</p>
<p>478</p>
<p> In the light of FCO concerns about the physical fitness of some DFID </p>
<p>contractors, DFID had taken a number of steps, in consultation with the FCO, to tighten </p>
<p>up pre&#8209;deployment medical fitness clearance and hostile environment training, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asking staff to complete the FCO&#8209;led fitness pre&#8209;assessment form for postings </p>
<p>to Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>372</p>
<p><b>752. </b> At the same time, DFID introduced its own counselling service for civilians </p>
<p>returning from fragile states.</p>
<p>483</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>753. </b> DFID officials recommended that service in November when approached by </p>
<p>consultancy firms asking what counselling or debriefing was available to staff recently </p>
<p>withdrawn from the Basra Palace site.</p>
<p>484</p>
<p><b>754. </b> Details of the new service were sent to DFID staff in London and Iraq on  </p>
<p>28 November.</p>
<p>485</p>
<p> Staff would be expected to attend debriefing counselling sessions as </p>
<p>part of existing security and medical procedures, in order to complement pre&#8209;deployment </p>
<p>medical clearance and the facilities provided in Iraq by Frontier Medical. </p>
<p><b>755. </b> DFID’s Procurement Group agreed that the service should be made available </p>
<p>to contractors on an exceptional basis, reflecting the particular conditions in Iraq, and </p>
<p>should not set a precedent for other countries.</p>
<p>486</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>756. </b> Participants at the Inquiry’s civilian outreach event commented on the range  </p>
<p>of security and welfare support offered by different departments before, during and  </p>
<p>after deployment. </p>
<p><b>757. </b> Non&#8209;MOD participants who had served in Iraq between mid&#8209;2004 and mid&#8209;2007 </p>
<p>reported that support in Iraq was poor. Staff were not briefed on what to expect </p>
<p>psychologically and there was criticism of the fact that Deputy Heads of Mission were </p>
<p>not trained as TRiM assessors or taught actively to look for stress warning signs in </p>
<p>their staff. Non&#8209;MOD staff had to take the initiative to find support if they needed it. </p>
<p>Participants also commented that there seemed to be no structured post&#8209;deployment </p>
<p>follow&#8209;up, although there was some suggestion that the FCO support had improved by </p>
<p>the first half of 2007.</p>
<p><b>758. </b> Participants also commented on the serious damage caused to staff morale </p>
<p>when senior staff without the right interpersonal skills were deployed to Iraq. FCO staff </p>
<p>suggested that the “can do” approach of FCO senior management limited its ability to </p>
<p>recognise when tasks might be impossible and to provide appropriate support to staff.</p>

<p><b>760. </b> Civil servants deployed to Iraq were covered for death and injury by the provisions </p>
<p>of the Civil Service Pension Scheme.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>761. </b> In June 2003, Treasury Solicitors advised DFID that its duty of care in Iraq did </p>
<p>not extend to “the provision of personal accident insurance against special risks arising </p>
<p>out of postings or travel overseas or, for that matter, advising employees to obtain </p>
<p>appropriate insurance cover”.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>762. </b> In October 2003, COBR commissioned an FCO&#8209;led review of training, security and </p>

<p>490</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>763. </b> On 11 November, Sir Michael Jay reported to Permanent Secretaries and the heads </p>
<p>of other organisations with personnel serving in Iraq that the review had found “no material </p>
<p>gaps or inconsistencies” between departments, except in the case of insurance, where </p>
<p>there was a difference between arrangements for MOD civilians and other civil servants.</p>

<p>Civil Service Pension Scheme and the advice on life insurance offered to secondees by </p>
<p>the FCO, the MOD and DFID. The paper explained that the FCO advised secondees </p>
<p>from the FCO and other government departments (excluding DFID and the MOD) to </p>
<p>check whether their life insurance policies covered death in Iraq. If insurers required </p>
<p>an extra premium to provide cover under an existing policy, the FCO would cover that </p>
<p>cost for maximum life cover of four times the officer’s salary. If insurers were unwilling </p>
<p>to provide cover, the FCO recommended taking out a new policy, on which the Iraq </p>
<p>Directorate could offer advice. As long as the policy had a term of at least 10 years, </p>
<p>the FCO would cover the costs on the same terms as for those paying extra premiums </p>
<p>for existing policies.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>374</p>
<p><b>766. </b> The MOD provided additional cover. If an insurer rejected a claim on a secondee’s </p>
<p>life policy solely because the secondee was deployed to Iraq or travelling in an MOD </p>
<p>aircraft, the MOD would pay the beneficiaries whatever sum they would otherwise have </p>
<p>received from the insurer. The MOD would indemnify a secondee injured in Iraq on the </p>
<p>same basis, but to a maximum of £50,000. Those indemnities were standard terms of </p>
<p>MOD deployment to operational areas and not Iraq&#8209;specific. </p>
<p><b>767. </b> The paper listed two discrepancies not mentioned in Sir Michael Jay’s covering </p>
<p>letter:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID alone had encouraged staff to increase death benefit by making additional </p>
<p>voluntary contributions to the Civil Service Pension Scheme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>FCO and DFID contracts required contractors to take out personal  </p>
<p>accident and travel insurance before deployment. The full cost was reimbursed </p>
<p>by the FCO and DFID up to a maximum death benefit of £300,000 (FCO) or </p>
<p>£250,000 (DFID). </p>
<p><b>768. </b> In May 2004, DFID reviewed insurance provisions for its staff working in or </p>
<p>visiting dangerous locations.</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> The absence of adequate provision was said to be </p>
<p>discouraging some existing staff from continuing to contribute to reconstruction in Iraq </p>
<p>and Afghanistan. Financial incentives were not thought to be an issue.</p>
<p><b>769. </b> The review stated:</p>
<p>“Ministry of Defence research suggests that there is no significantly greater risk </p>
<p>of death for service personnel embarking on operational deployment to dangerous </p>
<p>locations compared to working in the UK. Our own discussions with the Government </p>
<p>Actuary Department and the Office of National Statistics suggest that the probability </p>
<p>of death or injury in Iraq or Afghanistan is too random to predict.”</p>
<p><b>770. </b> DFID officials believed that there was a limited and, arguably, small additional risk </p>
<p>of death and injury. DFID staff were generally “less exposed to the same risks as service </p>
<p>personnel in Iraq/Afghanistan”. In line with its duty of care obligations, DFID had taken </p>
<p>all reasonable steps to protect staff:</p>
<p>“However, in the prevailing circumstances in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is </p>
<p>understandable that staff have reviewed their insurance cover … And insurance </p>
<p>companies have responded to the increased perception of a higher risk of death and </p>
<p>injury … by substantially increasing premiums …” </p>

<p>15.1  |  Civilian personnel</p>
<p>375</p>
<p><b>771. </b> The arguments for DFID providing additional cover were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to respond to “a partly irrational, but understandable, fear amongst our staff”: </p>
<p>if DFID did not give them what they wanted, they would not go; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to allow for the difficulties and/or expense they faced in getting additional cover. </p>
<p><b>772. </b> DFID officials discussed options with FCO and MOD counterparts and with the </p>
<p>Treasury. Among the changes proposed was the introduction of the MOD policy of </p>
<p>indemnifying secondees where an insurer rejected a claim. The FCO was reported </p>
<p>to be considering the same options, but had put a decision on hold while it waited </p>
<p>for the outcome of consideration by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board of a </p>
<p>compensation payment for two employees killed in the bombing of the British Consulate </p>
<p>General in Istanbul in 2003.</p>
<p><b>773. </b> The Treasury approved the DFID proposals, but urged officials to continue </p>
<p>discussions with the FCO and MOD “in the interests of joined&#8209;up government”. </p>
<p><b>774. </b> Revised DFID provisions, including indemnity cover to a maximum of £300,000, </p>
<p>were incorporated into the DFID terms and conditions for long&#8209;term assignments in Iraq </p>

<p><b>775. </b> Participants at the civilian outreach event described a striking and persistent </p>

<p>494</p>
<p> The letter was also sent to Sir Gus O’Donnell, the Cabinet Secretary. </p>
<p><b>777. </b> Mr Jeffrey reported that the study had looked in particular at co&#8209;ordination  </p>
<p>between different departments, their security advisers and providers. It had become </p>
<p>apparent that:</p>
<p>“… there were different practices in different locations, both within and between </p>
<p>departments … but there must be scope for identifying and spreading best practice. </p>
<p>For example, it may be useful for all to see the results of the risk assessment which </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>376</p>
<p><b>779. </b> Mr Jeffrey explained that the paper proposed “a formal standing cross&#8209;Government </p>
<p>group” on security and reported that he had agreed to create a new Directorate of </p>
<p>Operational Deployment Capability in PJHQ to provide a single focus within the MOD. </p>
<p><b>780. </b> Mr Jeffrey visited Iraq with Sir Peter Ricketts and Ms Susan Wardell, DFID Director </p>
<p>General Operations, from 4 to 7 December 2007. </p>
<p><b>781. </b> Mr Jeffrey’s briefing included a paper from Mr Jon Day, MOD Director General </p>
<p>Operational Policy, about the use of MOD civilians in operational theatres.</p>
<p>495</p>
<p> Mr Day </p>
<p>expressed concern about “whether we are right to continue the current course in high </p>
<p>risk environments such as Iraq and (increasingly) Afghanistan”. Concerns about security </p>
<p>had led the FCO to spend £37 million per annum on close protection for their “relatively </p>
<p>small number” of staff in Iraq. The security threat had also:</p>
<p>“… introduced a risk averse culture which is preventing MOD civilians embedded in </p>
<p>the Embassy and working in the Iraqi MOD from doing their jobs effectively – to such </p>
<p>an extent that I am increasingly inclined to start pulling them out.</p>
<p>“… [T]he growing difficulty we are having in filling posts suggests that some – many </p>
<p>– will not be as suitable as we would wish. I am not at all sure that all of the civilians </p>
<p>I met in Iraq would pass the new S2O fitness and health tests …”</p>
<p><b>782. </b> Mr Jeffrey described much of what was being done by MOD civilians in Iraq as </p>
<p>“a legacy of the more benign environments of the Balkans and post&#8209;TELIC 1 euphoria”. </p>
<p>Nobody appeared to be auditing the roles filled by civilians against the much more </p>
<p>hostile conditions that had prevailed until recently in Iraq. Mr Jeffrey cited the example </p>
<p>of civilian finance staff, whose roles could be taken by appropriately trained service </p>
<p>personnel. The MOD should minimise the number of non&#8209;essential civilian posts in </p>
<p>operational theatres. A small number of posts would have to be filled by civilians – </p>
<p>POLADs and perhaps scientific and contracts staff – but the right people would not </p>
<p>volunteer “simply for the money”. The MOD should “listen to what the current generation </p>
<p>say will continue to motivate them”. </p>
<p><b>783. </b> Mr Jeffrey advised discussing a coherent and sustainable approach to duty of care </p>
<p>with the FCO, observing that “at present we are less risk aware than the FCO in Iraq but </p>
<p>more risk aware in Afghanistan!”.</p>
<p><b>784. </b> Mr Benn told the Inquiry: </p>
<p><i>“</i>… you need to have a common approach for everybody, not a difference between </p>
<p>departments and that includes a responsibility of the duty of care you have for </p>

<p><b>785. </b> The Inquiry received conflicting evidence about whether those differences had </p>
<p>been resolved.</p>
<p><b>786. </b> Dr Shafik told the Inquiry: </p>
<p><i>“ </i>Peter Ricketts, the Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Office, and Bill Jeffrey, the </p>
<p>Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, and I, had a series of conversations </p>
<p>about this over 2008 and we worked very hard to see whether we could develop a </p>
<p>common duty of care regime for all civilians, and the security teams, particularly in </p>
<p>the MoD and the FCO, worked very hard on this, and I’m sure they could give you </p>
<p>more detail, but in the end of that process, we realised that our civilians are doing </p>
<p>such different things that it didn’t make sense to have identical regimes.” </p>
<p>497</p>
<p><b>787. </b> Mr Bowen told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Duty of care was a problem, but it was a problem actually that was gripped, or we </p>
<p>tried to grip it at a very senior level. Permanent secretaries were engaged in this, </p>
<p>and tried to resolve issues.” </p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>788. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti identified two key lessons about duty of care:</p>
<p>“One is about unifying tour lengths, and the other is about trying to unify terms and </p>
<p>conditions around staff security and duty of care. The latter has happened. So FCO </p>
<p>and DFID have the same standards.” </p>
<p>499</p>
<p><b>789. </b> Sir Gus O’Donnell told the Inquiry that, after a trip to Helmand Province in </p>
<p>Afghanistan with the FCO and MOD PUSs, he said to one of them: “One of the issues </p>
<p>we really need to sort out here is terms and conditions for people sent abroad and  </p>
<p>duty of care issues.” </p>
<p>500</p>
<p> Sir Gus concluded that terms and conditions were “not </p>
<p>completely harmonised”. The process was “not finished yet, but I think it has made  </p>
<p>a lot of progress”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>790. </b> In additional evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Gus O’Donnell stated:</p>
<p>“The FCO and MOD use different systems of risk assessment and management, </p>
<p>reflecting the different roles, purposes, and levels of training for their personnel </p>
<p>when deployed to high threat environments (DFID follow FCO arrangements). In all </p>
<p>locations, security arrangements for military and civilian personnel are determined </p>
<p>according to the threats present, and assessed on a case by case basis. There is no </p>
<p>“standard” or “standards” of duty of care as the practical discharge of duty of care is </p>
<p>case and context specific.</p>

<p>“However there do remain key differences between the FCO and MOD practices. </p>
<p>In Afghanistan, FCO civilians use close protection bodyguards, while MOD </p>
<p>civilians rely on military protection. Pay and allowances, duration of postings, </p>

<p><b>The Iraq Reconstruction Service Medal</b></p>
<p><b>791. </b> In May 2004, Mr David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, wrote to Mr Straw as Chair </p>
<p>of the AHMGIR to propose that UK police officers and other civilians seconded to </p>
<p>Iraq should be eligible for the Iraq campaign medal or a civilian equivalent.</p>
<p>502</p>
<p> Home </p>
<p>Office officials had advised the police that UK police officers seconded to Iraq might </p>
<p>be eligible for the Iraq Campaign Medal, but had since been advised by the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office Ceremonial Secretariat that it was a military medal for which police officers were </p>
<p>not eligible. Mr Blunkett suggested that would have been a reasonable position were </p>
<p>the campaign medal awarded solely to members of the Armed Forces, but civilians </p>
<p>serving directly with the Armed Forces in support of Op TELIC were also eligible. It was </p>
<p>“abundantly clear that our civilians in Iraq run risks to their own lives often comparable </p>
<p>to those faced by the military, and certainly probably [sic] greater than in civilian </p>
<p>deployments almost anywhere in the world”. </p>
<p><b>792. </b> Mr Blunkett warned that the repercussions for the police, who had been given to </p>
<p>understand that they were eligible, “could be very serious”. He recommended that the </p>
<p>eligibility criteria be changed or a new medal created.</p>
<p><b>793. </b> Mr Straw commended Mr Blunkett’s letter to Mr Douglas Alexander, Minister for the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office, and sent it to Mr Blair. Mr Straw stated: “I believe that the recognition of </p>
<p>all personnel serving directly in support of government policy in Iraq, whether serving in </p>
<p>Jordan or Iraq, should be appropriately rewarded.” </p>
<p>503</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>794. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull put three options to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extending the Iraq campaign medal to include other civilians, which was not </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a new medal to recognise civilian service in Iraq, which would create pressure </p>
<p>for a series of other medals, including for past campaigns; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>use of the Humanitarian Service Medal, approved in principle by the Queen </p>
<p>in 1999, which could provide appropriate means for rewarding civilian service </p>
<p>in Iraq and have longer&#8209;term application.</p>
<p>504</p>
<p><b>795. </b> Mr Benn supported the idea of a separate civilian medal.</p>
<p>505</p>
<p> He also requested </p>
<p>either greater flexibility in the allocation of honours to DFID, which, he said, only </p>
<p>received a small number, or an additional special list for Iraq. </p>
<p><b>796. </b> Mr Hoon told Mr Blair that he had “no difficulty with marking the contribution </p>
<p>made by civilians abroad”, but could not support use of the military campaign medal.</p>
<p>506</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He recommended an urgent review by the Cabinet Office Honours and Decorations </p>
<p>Committee of ways to provide wider recognition of civilian service “appropriate to the fast </p>
<p>moving situations in which we are increasingly likely to find ourselves”.</p>
<p><b>797. </b> Mr Blair asked the FCO to seek approval from the Queen for a special civilian </p>
<p>medal for Iraq and endorsed Mr Hoon’s separate proposal for a wider review.</p>
<p>507</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>798. </b> Mr Blair announced the Queen’s approval of the new medal in Parliament on  </p>
<p>30 June: </p>
<p>“We should pay tribute … to the many British public servants, policemen and  </p>
<p>women and volunteers, so ably led by David Richmond, the UK Special </p>
<p>Representative, who played a crucial role in helping the Iraqi people to rebuild their </p>
<p>lives under difficult and stressful conditions. Her Majesty the Queen has graciously </p>
<p>agreed that their extraordinary contribution should be recognised with the award </p>
<p>of a special civilian medal.” </p>

<p><b>799. </b> FCO officials explained to Sir Michael Jay in July 2004 that eligibility criteria, </p>

<p>out.</p>

<p> Late October 2004 was suggested as a possible date for a further public </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>380</p>
<p><b>801. </b> Sub&#8209;contractors, who included guards employed by Control Risks Group and </p>
<p>ArmorGroup, were excluded on the grounds that the numbers involved would “very </p>
<p>significantly increase production costs” and “risk devaluing the medal”. The Iraq </p>
<p>Directorate also observed that most sub&#8209;contractors “already receive considerable </p>
<p>financial reward for their efforts”. </p>
<p><b>802. </b> The proposal also excluded UK police officers employed at the Jordan International </p>
<p>Police Training Centre. While recognising that the police officers who set up the centre </p>
<p>had volunteered for service in Iraq, were expecting to be deployed there, and worked, </p>
<p>initially, in physically difficult conditions, the Iraq Directorate advised that service in Iraq </p>
<p>had carried an entirely different level of risk. </p>
<p><b>803. </b> A revised proposal, including sub&#8209;contractors, was put to Mr Straw in February.</p>
<p>511</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Officials advised that:</p>
<p>“Although these guards are well paid for their work, we believe that the risks  </p>
<p>that they undertake merit their inclusion. They are an essential part of our  </p>
<p>operation. Posts argue strongly that to exclude them would damage morale and </p>
<p>create divisions.”</p>
<p><b>804. </b> Mr Straw was “generally content” with the proposal, but asked whether a “blanket </p>
<p>exception” for LE staff was fair.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p><b>805. </b> The paper prepared by the FCO for the Cabinet Office in July 2005 included </p>
<p>sub&#8209;contractors, but not LE staff.</p>
<p>513</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>806. </b> The FCO paper listed the “risks and rigours” facing civilians who had served in Iraq </p>

<p>“<b>RISKS</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Overall a high risk to personnel both on and off duty.</p>

<p>about the absence of any reference to NGOs and aid or charity workers.</p>

<p>and have a negative impact on their security.</p>

<p>a certificate commending each individual’s contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>811. </b> Mr Benn recommended that, before Ministers took a final decision, the main  </p>
<p>NGOs should be contacted to confirm that they did not want their personnel to receive </p>
<p>the award.</p>
<p>515</p>
<p> That consultation process, which was carried out by DFID and took  </p>
<p>several months, reaffirmed the FCO’s advice that individuals working for NGOs should </p>
<p>not be eligible. </p>
<p><b>812. </b> Dr Howells approved the FCO’s eligibility criteria for the IRSM on 19 May 2006.</p>

<p><b>813. </b> In April 2006, with the details of the medal still not agreed, Acting ACC Barton, </p>
<p>Chief Police Adviser – Iraq (CPA&#8209;I), reported that awards to UK police officers serving </p>
<p>in Iraq remained a “bone of contention”.</p>
<p>517</p>
<p> Several staff had commented that police </p>
<p>officers and FCO staff did not receive the Op TELIC campaign medal. ACC Barton </p>
<p>proposed to award every member of staff who served three months in Iraq a Contingent </p>
<p>Commander’s Certificate of Merit. Commendations would be reserved for outstanding </p>

<p><b>815. </b> The Secretary to the Committee explained in a covering note that:</p>
<p>“No civilian medal has ever been awarded for civilian service in a war zone. It is </p>

<p>are disadvantaged by the application of less rigorous standards to a parallel medal </p>
<p>for civilians and members of the military in non&#8209;operational roles.</p>
<p>“The situation in Iraq has been unprecedented in terms of the number of civilians </p>
<p>who have been involved in reconstruction and the transition to democracy … </p>
<p>“These civilians have volunteered for this work. The work has been generally </p>
<p>well&#8209;rewarded financially. A concern of the MOD is the fact that the military have </p>
<p>been haemorrhaging personnel who leave the forces to become highly paid security </p>
<p>contractors in Iraq. There is some discomfort over the prospect of these people </p>

<p>519</p>
<p> It was decommissioned in 2013.</p>
<p>520</p>
<p><b>817. </b> The FCO told the Inquiry that “around 4,100” medals were awarded.</p>
<p>521</p>
<p><b>818. </b> A small number of recipients criticised the administration of the medal.</p>
<p><b>819. </b> In June 2008, Sir Peter Ricketts received an email from a recipient of the IRSM, </p>
<p>who believed that the medal’s value as a good way of honouring those who served in </p>
<p>Iraq had been “somewhat diminished by the manner in which it is administered”.</p>
<p>522</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The individual recognised that work was in hand in the FCO to improve administration </p>
<p>of the medal, but criticised the fact that individuals had to fill out an application form, </p>
<p>received the medal in a Jiffy bag, and that there was no presentation ceremony.</p>
<p><b>820. </b> Sir Peter commented to the IOU: “I don’t want any medals sent in Jiffy bags unless </p>
<p>staff specifically ask for that.” </p>
<p>523</p>
<p><b>821. </b> In his reply to the original email, Sir Peter explained that the application form </p>
<p>provided the FCO with important documentation for auditing purposes.</p>
<p>524</p>
<p> Presentation </p>
<p>of the medal was complicated by the need to balance the wishes of those who wanted </p>
<p>to receive theirs quickly, without great ceremony, and those preferring to wait for a more </p>
<p>formal ceremony, at post or in London. Dr Howells and Sir Peter had hosted a reception </p>
<p>for London&#8209;based recipients of the first batch of medals in 2007. A second reception </p>
<p>was planned for later in 2008. </p>
<p><b>822. </b> There were some critical comments about the medal from participants at the </p>
<p>Inquiry’s civilian outreach event, including that it had been sent in a rolled up brown </p>
<p>envelope, addressed to “Dear Colleague” and not even signed by the Permanent </p>
<p>Secretary. One participant had refused to accept a medal on the grounds that the </p>
<p>qualification was simply to have been in Iraq for a minimum period. </p>
<p><b>Locally engaged staff</b></p>
<p><b>823. </b> UK government departments and the UK military employed Iraqi citizens in various </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>384</p>
<p><b>825. </b> Concern about the safety of LE staff emerged in September 2003.</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>826. </b> On 18 September, during a visit to Baghdad, Mr Benn was told by UK secondees </p>
<p>to the CPA that “there was increased nervousness amongst Iraqi staff about doing their </p>
<p>jobs. Daily lives were difficult and the UN bombing [on 19 August 2003] had increased </p>
<p>these tensions.” </p>
<p>526</p>
<p><b>827. </b> Mr Dinham told the Inquiry that, during 2006 and 2007, access to a number of </p>
<p>infrastructure projects was so difficult that “we had to arrange to work through local </p>
<p>contractors … taking videos, taking digital images, contacting us by email, meeting </p>
<p>them in safe locations so we could actually supervise at one remove”.</p>
<p>527</p>
<p><b>828. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti paid tribute to the bravery of local staff:</p>
<p>“Some quite innovative project management techniques had to be applied when staff </p>
<p>could not get out of the Consul General’s office to go and monitor progress on some </p>
<p>of the infrastructure programmes. I have to say something about the courage of our </p>

<p><b>829. </b> On 20 April 2006, Mr Robin Lamb, British Consul General in Basra, reported that </p>
<p>law and order in Basra had deteriorated over the preceding few weeks and that:</p>
<p>“Most of our critical local staff (ie those who interpret or conduct external business </p>
<p>for us) now consider it too dangerous to come into work …</p>
<p>“We are taking steps to manage LE staff’s perceptions. We judge that the risk to </p>
<p>them is probably lower than they believe, and we have designed ways of working </p>
<p>to lower their exposure (flexible patterns, shifts, rotations). But it is hard to argue </p>
<p>with the facts on the ground. Murders have spiked in the last three weeks and there </p>
<p>is evidence that interpreters associated with MND(SE) and the wider Coalition have </p>
<p>been targeted.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We judge that local staff will feel safe to return to work when the Council boycott </p>
<p>[see Section 9.4] is lifted … Local staff tell us that they think it will be easier for them </p>
<p>once relations with the Council are restored …</p>
<p>“DFID see their situation slightly differently … Although two of DFID’s local partners </p>
<p>have been threatened, the risks to them are not as great as to our permanent local </p>

<p>529</p>
<p><b>830. </b> On 25 April, DFID officials advised Mr Benn that two LE staff working for the UK </p>
<p>at the Basra Palace site had left Iraq in fear of their lives after being followed home from </p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>530</p>
<p> The incident had caused concern among other LE staff, who had been given the </p>
<p>remainder of the week off. All local staff continued to have “standing permission not to </p>
<p>come to work if they felt unsafe”. The situation was to be reviewed once it was clearer </p>
<p>how many local staff considered it safe to return to work and it was possible to assess </p>
<p>the impact on the DFID programme. </p>
<p><b>831. </b> Mr Benn commented: “The right approach – our local staff have shown a lot of </p>
<p>courage and deserve all our support.” </p>
<p>531</p>
<p><b>832. </b> On 18 June, an LE member of staff at the British Embassy Office Basra was </p>
<p>murdered. His wife, also a local member of staff, was seriously injured.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>833. </b> On 29 June, local staff working for the British Embassy Office Basra were advised </p>

<p>there.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p> They were told there might come a point when their employment would have </p>
<p>to be terminated because of the risk to their safety, but the Embassy Office judged that </p>
<p>point had not yet been reached.</p>
<p><b>834. </b> During the second half of 2006, FCO and DFID officials exchanged views on </p>
<p>departments’ duty of care to LE staff. </p>
<p><b>835. </b> Ms Diana Brookes, FCO Legal Counsellor, advised FCO officials: </p>
<p>“The important point is that even if they [LE staff] have accepted the risks involved </p>
<p>this does not absolve the FCO from liability in terms of duty of care in an individual </p>
<p>case. If the view is taken that the risk is so great that LE staff should not continue </p>
<p>working at this time then I do not see how we could be meeting our duty of care to </p>
<p>them by allowing them to turn down the voluntary severance package. If the risk is </p>
<p>that high then the severance package should be made compulsory for all LE staff, </p>
<p>otherwise we risk the possibility of liability for breach of our duty of care if a further </p>
<p>incident were to happen.” </p>

<p>386</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Ms Liz Davis, DFID Human Resources Director, advised DFID officials:</p>
<p>“It is our responsibility to ensure the health, safety and welfare of our staff. A failure </p>
<p>to do so is a breach of our responsibilities in law and potentially a failure of our </p>
<p>common law duty if we act negligently. This framework is not the same for the </p>
<p>military. The test at law will be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>have we assessed the risks, </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>controlled those risks as far as possible, </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>trained staff where appropriate, </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>and monitored the issues.” </p>
<p>535</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>837. </b> Those responsibilities would normally be confined to “working time”, an approach </p>
<p>Ms Davis did not believe to be reasonable in Iraq. Ms Davis advised that, as an </p>
<p>employer, DFID could not be held responsible for the overall security situation, but that </p>
<p>the picture was clouded by the wider role of the UK Government. </p>
<p><b>838. </b> A table prepared by the British Council in July itemised some of the differences </p>
<p>between the packages offered by the FCO and DFID (and the British Council), including </p>
<p>grievance procedures, “security leave” and entitlement to termination benefits.</p>
<p>536</p>
<p><b>839. </b> By October 2006, all but one of the Iraqi civilian staff working at the Basra Palace </p>
<p>site had been replaced by third country nationals because of “a growing campaign of </p>

<p>15.1  |  Civilian personnel</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Mr Giles Lever, Head of the IPU, advised Mr Miliband that officials in the FCO, </p>
<p>MOD, DFID, Home Office and Cabinet Office had found it difficult to agree a common </p>
<p>approach:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO saw a strong moral, reputational and operational case for doing more </p>
<p>to assist Iraqi staff facing security threats and those who had been forced to </p>
<p>leave UK government employment due to security. The FCO had around  </p>
<p>27 LE staff in Baghdad and estimated no more than 100 current and former  </p>
<p>staff in Basra would be eligible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID, with a very small number of LE staff, broadly shared the FCO view.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD had directly employed around 15,000 Iraqi citizens since 2003, </p>
<p>and tens of thousands more through international or local contractors. It was </p>
<p>“nervous about the resource implications for any commitment to do more for </p>
<p>Iraqi staff”. The MOD was also concerned that any promise of assistance to </p>
<p>LE staff (for example, asylum in the UK) would be “a catalyst for an exodus </p>
<p>of staff” and “would undermine MND (SE)’s ability to operate effectively”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Home Office was “predictably unwilling to contemplate any relaxation of the </p>
<p>asylum/immigration rules for Iraqis who have worked for HMG, especially in view </p>
<p>of MOD’s numbers”. It was also concerned that any change in policy “could act </p>
<p>as a pull factor for a large number of Iraqis”.</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>842. </b> On 7 August, the Cabinet Office advised Mr Brown that the numbers involved </p>
<p>were large, policy differed between the FCO/DFID and the MOD, and “our current </p>
<p>immigration/asylum policies mean that there are few straightforward options”.</p>
<p>542</p>
<p> The two </p>
<p>principal alternatives were resettlement and financial assistance. </p>
<p><b>843. </b> Three options were put forward for reducing the number of eligible staff to more </p>
<p>manageable levels:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Distinguishing between LE staff directly employed by the UK and those hired on </p>
<p>a casual basis or via contractor. More than 15,000 Iraqi citizens would still be </p>
<p>eligible, but a large number hired through international or local contractors would </p>
<p>be excluded.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establishing a minimum level of service of perhaps 12 or 24 months. Depending </p>
<p>on the timeframe, about 330 or 230 Iraqi citizens would be eligible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prioritising interpreters and other white collar staff on the grounds that </p>
<p>professional staff were mission critical and more closely identifiable with the UK. </p>
<p>Questions of fairness could arise. Around 120 (12&#8209;month minimum service) or </p>
<p>100 (24&#8209;month minimum service) were estimated to be eligible. </p>
<p><b>844. </b> Mr Brown asked the Cabinet Office to co&#8209;ordinate a Whitehall&#8209;wide review, </p>
<p>reporting to the Defence, Foreign and Home Secretaries.</p>
<p>543</p>

<p>a minimum threshold for assistance and consider whether more could be offered to </p>
<p>a subset of Iraqi employees, against clear criteria and with possible resettlement in </p>
<p>third countries. It should also consider the implications for UK operations in Iraq and </p>
<p>elsewhere, and for UK asylum policy.</p>
<p><b>845. </b> The ‘Review of Locally Engaged Staff’, written by the FCO with input from other </p>
<p>departments, was sent to Ministers on 1 October.</p>
<p>544</p>
<p> The review recommended the </p>
<p>establishment of “discrete schemes to assist sub&#8209;sets of a) serving and b) former Iraqi </p>
<p>LE staff”. Objective criteria, such as the length of service should be the main method </p>
<p>for deciding which staff should be eligible. </p>
<p><b>846. </b> The review stated:</p>
<p>“Because records of former staff, in particular the estimated 20,000 employed </p>
<p>by MOD, are incomplete, it is extremely difficult to assess with any certainty the </p>
<p>numbers of former staff who might be … eligible …”</p>
<p><b>847. </b> Ministers agreed on 3 October that “the best solution was to offer assistance as an </p>
<p>ex&#8209;gratia package, not as a reward for service, but with the implicit recognition that the </p>
<p>uniquely difficult circumstances formed part of the justification for that package”.</p>
<p>545</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>848. </b> Ministers also agreed to set a minimum of 12 months’ service for serving staff and </p>
<p>that for former staff, only the “professional cadres” would be eligible. The package would </p>
<p>include financial assistance, resettlement in third countries and resettlement via the </p>
<p>Gateway Protection Programme.</p>
<p>546</p>
<p> On funding, the Home Office would offer £6 million </p>
<p>from the annual Gateway budget. Additional costs should be met where possible by </p>
<p>employing departments. In the MOD’s case that would entail a call on the Reserve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>849. </b> Ministers met again on 8 October to reach agreement on whether existing staff </p>
<p>should be offered the additional option of Exceptional Leave to Enter the UK direct from </p>
<p>Iraq and, if so, how that would be funded.</p>
<p>547</p>
<p> Ministers agreed that the MOD should </p>
<p>be able to claim up to £20 million from the Reserve and would provide up to a further </p>
<p>£5 million from its existing budgets. </p>
<p><b>850. </b> Mr Brown announced the scheme to Parliament later on 8 October: </p>
<p>“I would … like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of our civilian </p>
<p>and locally employed staff in Iraq, many of whom have worked in extremely </p>
<p>difficult circumstances, exposing themselves and their families to danger. I am </p>
<p>pleased therefore to announce today a new policy which more fully recognises the </p>

<p>549</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>852. </b> Neither the MOD nor the FCO</p>
<p> </p>
<p>was able to provide precise figures for the number </p>
<p>of Iraqi citizens employed since 2003 and likely to be eligible under the scheme.</p>
<p>550</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>853. </b> At a Ministerial meeting to discuss LE staff on 18 September, Lord Drayson, </p>
<p>Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support, conceded that the MOD “had  </p>
<p>not done a good job on record keeping”. In discussion, Ministers commented that  </p>
<p>further work on the issue was “unlikely to deliver much more clarity given the nature </p>
<p>of the records”.</p>
<p>551</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>854. </b> On 30 October, Mr Miliband gave more detail on eligibility, the package on offer </p>
<p>and application procedures: </p>
<p>“Both fairness and realism demand that we focus on that sub&#8209;set of staff who have </p>
<p>had the closest and most sustained association with us, in circumstances which we </p>
<p>judge to be uniquely difficult. We have therefore established clear and transparent </p>
<p>eligibility criteria which are, as far as possible, objective in nature.</p>
<p>“… We need to preserve our ability to recruit and retain qualified staff … Both the </p>
<p>overall policy, and the design of the scheme in respect of serving staff have been </p>
<p>designed with this in mind.</p>
<p>“Finally, we have taken into account the need to ensure that any assistance …  </p>
<p>is practical, realistic and preserves the integrity of wider immigration and asylum </p>
<p>policy …</p>
<p>“The assistance … is offered ex&#8209;gratia and goes above and beyond the confines </p>
<p>of what is lawfully or contractually required.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>Many applications were “obviously inadmissible”, but a surprising number raised difficult </p>
<p>questions. A number of principles had informed decisions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Individuals on Letters of Appointment who did not fulfil the ‘‘Eligibility criteria for </p>
<p>former staff’’ were not eligible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those still on the payroll on 8 August 2007 but not currently working because </p>
<p>of threats should be counted as current staff.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those meeting the job criteria for only a brief period, such as providers of </p>
<p>“occasional interpreting”, were not eligible, however long they had worked for </p>
<p>the UK.</p>
<p><b>856. </b> The first 18 “current staff” arrived in the UK from Basra on 8 April 2008.</p>
<p>553</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By 22 May, the UK had received 1,138 applications for assistance, of which 503 had </p>
<p>been assessed as eligible, with almost half the successful applicants opting for the </p>
<p>financial package.</p>
<p><b>857. </b> In March 2009, Mr Miliband informed Ms Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, that </p>
<p>an assessment of the Locally Engaged Staff Assistance Scheme by Home Office, FCO, </p>
<p>MOD, DFID and Cabinet Office officials had concluded that it was “working well” and </p>
<p>only “minor adjustments” were needed.</p>
<p>554</p>
<p> Mr Miliband explained that he had agreed a </p>
<p>recommendation to set a cut&#8209;off date after which new applications from “former” staff </p>
<p>would not be accepted. He sought Ms Smith’s agreement to continue the scheme for </p>
<p>serving staff, with a review of its future in September 2009. </p>
<p><b>858. </b> On 23 March, Mr Miliband announced to Parliament that the scheme was “popular </p>

<p>392</p>
<p><b>870. </b> In 2006, the requirement to produce a combined total for the three groups of </p>
<p>civilians lapsed, resulting in large gaps in the record for the later period. Figures for 2006 </p>
<p>onwards were compiled for the Inquiry by the MOD from units’ individual returns. </p>
<p><b>871. </b> Mr Jon Thompson, the MOD PUS from 2012 to 2016, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I do not see any prospect of our being able to provide you with figures  </p>
<p>which we can guarantee to be comprehensive. I am at least assured that  </p>
<p>systems now in place would enable us to provide the current data for Afghanistan </p>
<p>without difficulty.” </p>
<p>562</p>
<p><b>872. </b> The information provided by DFID was compiled from a number of sources, </p>
<p>including duty of care sheets, contractors’ records and medical spreadsheets.</p>
<p>563</p>
<p><b>873. </b> Mr Mark Lowcock, the DFID Permanent Secretary since 2011, explained that </p>
<p>“achieving 100 per cent accuracy in this data would require a disproportionate amount </p>
<p>of staff time (if it was possible at all)”, but expressed confidence that “the trends present </p>
<p>in the data are reliable”.</p>
<p>564</p>
<p><b>874. </b> The Inquiry has produced a set of graphs and tables, drawing mostly on the data </p>
<p>submitted by the FCO, the MOD and DFID, that gives a broad indication of overall </p>
<p>numbers and trends. </p>
<p><b>875. </b> Because of the limitations of the source material and the variety of sources used, </p>
<p>the numbers quoted are approximate and, in some cases, are inconsistent with each </p>
<p>other and cannot be reconciled. </p>

<p>shared many of the flaws of UK data for the same period. An audit of CPA personnel </p>
<p>management by the Office of the CPA Inspector General in June 2004 found that:</p>
<p>“… by the end of January 2004, many distinct personnel tracking mechanisms </p>
<p>appeared that were intended to provide accountability for select groups of </p>
<p>individuals. In addition, contractors were tracking their own employees. As of  </p>
<p>March 8, 2004, the CPA believed it had a total of 1,196 personnel assigned to  </p>
<p>CPA operations in Baghdad. The CPA had been authorized 2,117 positions.  </p>

<p><b>905. </b> The audit stated that CPA officials believed their rosters were 90 to 95 percent </p>

<p>accounted for.</p>
<p><b>906. </b> The audit found even less information about staff deployed outside Baghdad:</p>
<p>“CPA officials stated that if personnel departed Kuwait or other rear area to a </p>
<p>forward site, other than Baghdad, such as Al Hilla, Basra or Erbil, in support of CPA </p>
<p>Operations there were no reliable procedures to identify and account for these </p>

<p>provide limited, if any, information to the CPA in Baghdad or Washington DC.”</p>
<p><b>907. </b> A report to Congress by the US General Accounting Office (GAO) in June 2004 </p>
<p>stated that the total number of CPA civilian and military personnel in Baghdad peaked </p>
<p>at 1,239 in April 2004 (see Table 5).</p>
<p>594</p>
<p> That figure was estimated to be about 90 percent </p>

<p><b>921. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti explained the role of DFID “consultants” to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… what we were very keen to do was use consultants in … project work around </p>
<p>certain projects that had to be completed with deep technical skills that DFID staff  </p>
<p>no longer have. We don’t have those water engineers and power engineers we used </p>
<p>to have … </p>
<p>“The DFID staff were working much more at the policy end on capacity. So how do </p>
<p>you put a budget together in the Ministry of Finance? What would you need to run </p>
<p>a Prime Minister’s office properly, and those sorts of things that DFID staff focused </p>
<p>on much more.”</p>
<p><b>922. </b> A 2013 report on DFID’s use of contractors by the Independent Commission for </p>
<p>Aid Impact explained that they were used in roles ranging from procuring equipment and </p>
<p>providing technical advice to implementing development programmes.</p>
<p>610</p>
<p><b>923. </b> The FCO, with a focus on bilateral and policy work carried out by core FCO </p>
<p>staff, employed contractors in smaller numbers, and principally during the CPA period. </p>
<p>In January 2004, the FCO employed 23 contractors in Baghdad to work for the CPA.</p>
<p>611</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In October 2004, there were just two FCO contractors in Iraq.</p>
