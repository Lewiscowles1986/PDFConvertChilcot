<p>3</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>three examples of a significant capability gap during operations in Iraq: protected </p>
<p>mobility, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance </p>
<p>(ISTAR) and support helicopters; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact that deploying a medium scale force to Afghanistan in 2006 had on </p>
<p>the provision of military equipment to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the process by which equipment was funded, which is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 13.1; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD operational policy or the specific circumstances in which individuals lost </p>
<p>their lives in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD’s procedure for supporting those killed or injured in Iraq, which is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 16.3.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has agreed to declassify a large amount of material </p>
<p>for this Section but there were places where that was not possible for national security </p>
<p>reasons. In those few cases, the Inquiry has agreed with the MOD either to redact </p>
<p>the material or replace it with a cipher. Where ciphers appear, they will be explained  </p>
<p>in a footnote.</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><b>The procurement process</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> The MOD’s financial planning framework for its core budget comprised two distinct </p>
<p>elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Short Term Plan (STP); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Defence Programme.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The STP forecast spending on operational costs. Those were predominantly the </p>
<p>responsibilities of the Front Line Commands (FLCs). The STP looked forward four years. </p>
<p>Significant investment programmes, where a four&#8209;year planning horizon was too short, </p>
<p>would be considered in the Defence Programme.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The Defence Programme provided a 10 year budget to balance capital spend </p>
<p>priorities across equipment procurement, equipment support and non&#8209;equipment </p>
<p>investments. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The Defence Progamme comprised three strands:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the procurement of new capability through the Equipment Procurement Plan </p>
<p>(EPP) which looked forward 30 years;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provision of equipment support through the Equipment Support Plan (ESP) </p>
<p>which was planned over 10 years; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Non&#8209;Equipment Investment Plan which planned for investment in </p>
<p>non&#8209;military equipment, such as IT.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> Collectively the EPP and the ESP were known as the Equipment Plan (EP).</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Procuring equipment was achieved through the MOD’s Smart Acquisition process, </p>
<p>which was established in 1998 and sought to enable a high level of confidence that </p>
<p>equipment projects would be delivered on time and within budget.</p>

<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>Addressing equipment capability gaps</b></p>
<p><b>Three key requirements</b></p>
<p>When a capability gap in equipment is identified, there are three requirements that must </p>
<p>be fulfilled to initiate the procurement process:</p>
<p><b>Statement of Requirement (SOR): </b>A statement articulating a capability shortfall; it states </p>
<p>what is required.</p>
<p><b>Urgent Statement of User Requirement (USUR): </b>If the SOR cannot be met by an </p>
<p>adjustment of existing assets, a USUR is raised which indicates that there is a capability </p>
<p>gap that currently cannot be met. If the USUR is endorsed, it will be designated as either </p>
<p>an Urgent Operational Requirement, or an Urgent Sustainability Requirement. It cannot </p>
<p>be both.</p>
<p><b>Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR):</b> A UOR seeks to address a capability gap </p>
<p>by rapidly procuring new or additional equipment or the enhancement of, or essential </p>
<p>modification to, existing equipment. That may involve bringing forward the planned </p>
<p>procurement of equipment from the future Equipment Programme.</p>
<p><b>Urgent Sustainability Requirement (USR): </b>A USR seeks to address a sustainability gap </p>
<p>by rapidly acquiring additional in&#8209;service support.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> During Operation TELIC in Iraq, Urgent Statements of User Requirements (USURs) </p>
<p>for new equipment were forwarded to the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) who </p>
<p>retained ownership of the USUR until it was signed off. The head of PJHQ was the Chief </p>
<p>of Joint Operations (CJO).</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Each edition of the Op TELIC Directive, issued by the Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(CDS) to the CJO, stated:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“Force Protection.</b> You are responsible to me for the force protection of all </p>
<p>assigned UK personnel and materiel in your JOA [Joint Operational Area] in </p>
<p>order to ensure their security from the threats of, WMD, espionage, sabotage, </p>
<p>subversion, terrorism and crime …”</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“UORs [Urgent Operational Requirements]</b> … You are to identify as soon as </p>
<p>possible any further capability shortfalls and user requirements for the support </p>
<p>of ongoing operations; these should be submitted to DCDS (EC) [Deputy Chief </p>
<p>of Defence Staff (Equipment Capability)].”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The responsibilities of the PJHQ and Front Line Commands (FLCs) for pursuing </p>
<p>capability shortfalls through the UOR process were set out in a “Standing Instruction” </p>
<p>issued in November 2004.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4 </p>
<p>Letter CDS to CJO, 30 July 2003, ‘Chief of the Defence Staff Directive to the Joint Commander for </p>
<p>Operation TELIC (Edition 3)’.</p>
<p>5 </p>
<p>Minute Soar to UOR Stakeholder, 26 November 2004, ‘Urgent Operational/Sustainability Requirements – </p>
<p>Standing Instruction (Version 1)’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>14. </b> To identify a new requirement the instruction stated: </p>
<p>“Once operations have commenced any subsequent shortfalls will usually be </p>
<p>identified by in&#8209;theatre forces. Regardless of the phase of the operation, any </p>
<p>capability shortfall is articulated through a Statement of Requirement (SOR).” </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The instruction also stated: </p>
<p>“The SOR is reviewed by PJHQ/FLC/Jt Cmnd [Joint Command] Staffs who will then </p>
<p>either close the gap through re&#8209;brigading of current assets or by raising an USUR </p>
<p>[Urgent Statement of User Requirement]. The USUR is then staffed by PJHQ … </p>
<p>If endorsed, the USUR is passed to the … Directorate of Equipment Capability </p>
<p>(DEC) …”</p>
<p><b>Roles and responsibilities for addressing capability gaps</b></p>
<p><b>Equipment Capability Customer (ECC) </b>was created by the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence </i></p>
<p><i>Review</i> to bring together the teams specifying future military needs – known as the </p>
<p>Directorates of Equipment Capability (DECs).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> The ECC was headed by the Deputy Chief </p>
<p>of Defence Staff (Equipment Capability) who reported to the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) </p>
<p>through the Vice Chief of Defence Staff.</p>
<p>The ECC was responsible for providing funded capability requirements to meet the current </p>
<p>and future needs of the Armed Forces and ensure the equipment was delivered into </p>
<p>service. The ECC was designated as “Customer One” in the process.</p>
<p>As well as the DECs, the ECC comprised:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Directorate of Capabilities, Resources and Scrutiny (DCRS)</b> providing internal </p>
<p>scrutiny of programmes; and </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Joint Capabilities Board (JCB)</b> to make balance of investment decisions across the </p>
<p>Equipment Programme.</p>
<p><b>Front Line Commands (FLCs) </b>were<b> </b>designated as the “User” of equipment and referred </p>
<p>to as “Customer Two” in the process.</p>
<p><b>PJHQ </b>assessed and reviewed requirements; SORs and USURs.</p>
<p><b>Directorates of Equipment Capability (DECs) </b>were responsible for establishing a </p>
<p>Capability Working Group to consider each USUR and, if required, for producing a </p>
<p>business case seeking approval with advice from the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) </p>
<p>on the options and procurement strategy for meeting the requirement. </p>
<p>In 2003, equipment was provided and supported by two separate MOD organisations:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) </b>which procured the equipment for the Armed </p>
<p>Forces; and</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) </b>which was responsible for providing and </p>
<p>directing logistics support for in&#8209;service equipment.</p>
<p>6 </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Within the DPA and the DLO were a number of <b>Integrated Project Teams (IPTs)</b> focused </p>
<p>on delivering individual projects and programmes as directed by the DECs. The IPT was </p>
<p>responsible for the equipment throughout its life.</p>
<p>The DPA and the DLO merged to form the <b>Defence Equipment and Support Agency </b></p>
<p><b>(DE&amp;S) </b>in April 2007.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> The Head of the DE&amp;S was the <b>Chief of Defence Materiel.</b></p>
<p><b>16. </b> A process diagram attached to the November 2004 Standing Instruction indicated </p>
<p>that PJHQ had the lead responsibility for identification of a requirement, working with </p>
<p>the Directorate of Equipment Capability (DEC), the FLCs and the relevant Integrated </p>
<p>Project Team (IPT) in the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) or Defence Logistics </p>
<p>Organisation (DLO). </p>
<p><b>17. </b> The instruction included an annex with a list of “UOR key stakeholders” and their </p>
<p>roles and responsibilities. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> The list began with the responsibilities of “Force Elements”: the deployed units </p>
<p>reporting to the in&#8209;theatre commander, which was the General Officer Commanding </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) (GOC MND(SE)) during Op TELIC. The annex </p>
<p>said that the Force Elements were responsible for raising SORs, along with any training </p>
<p>and integration.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The role and responsibilities of FLCs included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Conducts routine audits to identify potential USURs as part of the Equipment </p>
<p>Capability Shortfall Register.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“USUR originator.”</p>
<p><b>20. </b> The role and responsibilities of PJHQ included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Reviews/endorses USURs and submits to DEC.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Agrees solutions to capability gaps proposed by DECs.”</p>
<p><b>21. </b> In response to a request from the Inquiry in 2011, the MOD provided further </p>
<p>evidence on how the UOR process functioned in Iraq.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> The MOD stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The fundamental elements of the UOR process remained broadly the same </p>
<p>throughout operations in Iraq.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Staff deployed in Iraq, and (in the build&#8209;up to the operation) staff in FLCs, were </p>
<p>responsible for identifying capability gaps “which could not be met by existing </p>
<p>holdings”.</p>

<p>8 </p>
<p>Paper [MOD], 8 June 2011, ‘How the UOR Process Functioned During the Campaign in Iraq’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>USURs were submitted to PJHQ for authorisation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In addition: “Staff in PJHQ could (and did) raise USURs themselves if they </p>
<p>became of [sic] aware capability gaps.” </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The Inquiry submitted a further request to the MOD in 2015, seeking clarification </p>
<p>on where the primary responsibility for identifying capability gaps lay during Op TELIC.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The MOD said that a draft USUR “would be originated by any user” and that “there </p>
<p>appears to be no simple answer to the question where the primary responsibility for </p>
<p>identifying capability gaps and raising USURs lay”.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The MOD added:</p>
<p>“Clearly the emphasis in the process was on the co&#8209;operation of the various </p>
<p>commands and branches involved. But it appears that the onus for initial </p>
<p>identification of requirements, at least once a campaign was in progress, lay with the </p>
<p>theatre commander [GOC MND(SE)], while the responsibility for signing them off lay </p>
<p>with PJHQ. Between those two stages the process of analysing the requirement and </p>
<p>developing the solution was essentially a shared one.”</p>
<p><b>24. <i></b> The Acquisition Handbook </i>in 2002<i> </i>defined the role of Single Service Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>as to:</p>
<p>“… provide overall strategic management of the individual services and their </p>
<p>professional direction. This role supports ECC decisions on capability by providing </p>
<p>advice and experience on the full range of factors contributing to military capability, </p>
<p>including: concepts and doctrine, in&#8209;service equipment, sustainability, training, force </p>
<p>structure, decision support and personnel. Single Service Chiefs are responsible </p>
<p>for ensuring that the JCB [Joint Capabilities Board] and Capability Working Groups </p>
<p>receive appropriate input on such matters to develop future capability.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>25. </b> The Inquiry asked General Sir John Reith, CJO from August 2001 to May 2004, </p>
<p>whether he had submitted any UORs while planning for the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> He replied:</p>
<p>“I didn’t submit UORs. The Single Services submit the UORs, because … they are </p>
<p>required to deliver to the Chief of Joint Operations fully trained and equipped people. </p>
<p>What I did was; we screened the UORs to ensure that they were necessary before </p>
<p>the MOD approved them.”</p>
<p><b>26. </b> For the Commander in Chief Land Command, that included providing advice to the </p>
<p>CJO on capability requirements for units deployed on operations.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> General Sir Richard Dannatt, Commander in Chief Land Command from March </p>
<p>2005 to August 2006, told the Inquiry that, as “the second senior member of the Army”, </p>
<p>the Commander in Chief Land Command had “an important role to play on the Army </p>

<p>Board”. He had a role in influencing the Chief of the General Staff, but his primary role </p>
<p>was to ensure “whatever troops are required … are made available, that the units are </p>
<p>properly trained, manned and equipped to the greatest degree possible, and that’s his </p>
<p>primary responsibility”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The USUR process only applied to new capability requirements. Where </p>
<p>in&#8209;service support was needed to sustain existing equipment, an Urgent Sustainability </p>
<p>Requirement (USR) was raised.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The Standing Instruction issued on 26 November 2004 stated that the Urgent </p>
<p>Sustainability Requirement (USR) process was operated in parallel to the UOR process </p>
<p>but by the DLO.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> This was “to deliver urgently required stocks and spares to meet </p>
<p>operational sustainability requirements”. The “key points” about the process included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>USRs followed “a similar staffing process as UORs”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DLO procured, tracked and accounted for USR expenditure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no formal review because DEC, IPT and industry support was </p>
<p>already in place for the required equipment. </p>
<p><b>The need for an expeditionary capability</b></p>
<p><b>30. </b> The 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review</i> (SDR) set out the UK’s defence requirements </p>
<p>in the period up to 2015.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> The importance of the SDR assumptions for equipment available to the forces </p>
<p>deployed for the invasion of Iraq is addressed in Section 6.3.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> The SDR explained that, “in the post Cold War world”, there was a greater need for </p>
<p>the Armed Forces to build an expeditionary capability because “we must be prepared to </p>
<p>go to the crisis, rather than have the crisis come to us”.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> A supporting essay to the SDR listed the future military capabilities it considered </p>
<p>“increasingly important”, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>command, control, communications and computers, and Intelligence, </p>
<p>Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the trend towards force projections operations, for which we may need to </p>
<p>deploy very rapidly in order to be successful, places an increasing premium </p>
<p>on transport or lift capabilities”.</p>

<p>command, and was responsible for the peacetime management of the entire battlefield </p>
<p>helicopter fleet, and for generating the required battlefield helicopter force package </p>
<p>for operations.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>35. </b> The SDR also provided some detail on the equipment required to support the new </p>
<p>type of expeditionary operations that it envisaged. Those included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>new strategic lift assets, both C17 heavy&#8209;lift aircraft and Roll&#8209;on Roll&#8209;off shipping; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new helicopter carrier;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>additional support helicopters;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an increase in the provision of ISTAR assets including Unmanned Aerial </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a modernised air transport fleet; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the creation of two Joint Force Logistic Component Headquarters.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The SDR acknowledged that “major equipments take years to develop”. While it </p>
<p>identified no definitive timescales for its proposed changes, the MOD did publish a series </p>
<p>of targets in December 1998 as part of their Public Service Agreement 1999&#8209;2002.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those included establishing the Full Joint Rapid Reaction Forces Capability by October </p>

<p><b>37. </b> The SDR emphasised the importance of investment in ISTAR assets “not only to </p>
<p>maintain a qualitative edge in combat but to facilitate the often rapid&#8209;decision&#8209;making </p>

<p><b>40. </b> On the Armed Forces’ ability to conduct multiple, simultaneous operations, the MOD </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“The capability of our forces is strained not just by the scale of operations, but by the </p>
<p>number of simultaneous or near&#8209;simultaneous operations. Since the SDR we have </p>
<p>assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake either a single major operation </p>
<p>(of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to the Gulf War in 1990&#8209;91), </p>
<p>or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale (as in the </p>
<p>mid&#8209;1990s in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial </p>
<p>deployment – which might involve a combat brigade and appropriate naval and air </p>
<p>forces – if this were made necessary by a second crisis. We would not, however, </p>
<p>expect both deployments to involve war&#8209;fighting or to maintain them simultaneously </p>
<p>for longer than 6 months.”</p>
<p><b>41. </b> The MOD had “analysed a set of plausible and realistic scenarios” to assess </p>
<p>the demands potentially faced by the UK overseas. That work had taken account of </p>
<p>lessons learned from operations, including in Afghanistan. The MOD recognised that the </p>
<p>particular scenarios it had envisaged may not be “replicated precisely in real life”, but </p>
<p>they did allow the MOD to “draw general conclusions about the capabilities that may be </p>
<p>particularly important”. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> In assessing capabilities for operations abroad, the MOD concluded that the SDR </p>
<p>was “generally taking our Armed Forces in the right direction, but reinforced the growing </p>
<p>importance” already attached to “network&#8209;centric capability”. That concept had “emerged </p>
<p>substantially in the 1991 Gulf Conflict” and “demonstrated how precision weapons and </p>
<p>shared information technologies could be linked together to produce devastating military </p>
<p>effects with unparalleled speed and accuracy”.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Network&#8209;centric capability had three elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>sensors (to gather information);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a network (to fuse, communicate and exploit the information); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strike assets to deliver military effect. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> The MOD stated that it had already invested in a range of sensors, including </p>

<p>12</p>
<p><b>48. </b> From 21 January 2003, Lord Bach, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and </p>
<p>Minister for Defence Procurement, was asked by Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, </p>
<p>to take temporary responsibility for the progression of UORs. Lord Bach’s role, and the </p>
<p>weekly meetings he chaired with senior officials to consider progress, is addressed more </p>
<p>extensively in Section 6.3.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> On 7 February, Air Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Equipment Capability) (DCDS(EC)) from April 2002 to May 2003, advised Lord Bach </p>
<p>that an agreement in principle had been reached with the Treasury to continue funding </p>
<p>“small scale UORs” for operations following the combat phase: </p>
<p>“We are starting to identify potential UORs for aftermath operations but will need </p>
<p>a robust concept of operations if we are to secure Treasury agreement to fund such </p>
<p>measures. Initial plans are being developed by PJHQ and are being taken forward </p>
<p>by DCDS(C) staff, but must be seen in light of US plans and the wider Government </p>
<p>context for which the FCO has the lead.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>50. </b> In an update to Lord Bach on 28 February, Rear Admiral Charles Style, Capability </p>
<p>Manager (Strategic Deployment), wrote that the MOD continued to “identify, prioritise </p>
<p>and refine potential UORs” for Phase IV.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>51. </b> RAdm Style wrote key enhancements that were “likely to be required” included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>force protection against the asymmetric threat, particularly for elements of the </p>
<p>air transport fleet; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>long&#8209;term infrastructure enhancements. </p>
<p><b>52. </b> On 14 March, RAdm Style reported to Lord Bach that the Treasury had accepted in </p>
<p>principle that some additional resources from the Reserve</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> would be needed for Phase </p>
<p>IV UORs.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>53. </b> RAdm Style wrote that work was continuing to clarify and better define UOR </p>
<p>requirements for Phase IV: 26 had been identified as high priority “regardless of the </p>
<p>CONOPS” and a further 84 possible UORs had been identified by Front Line Commands </p>
<p>but would remain “below the line” until the CONOPS had been developed further.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> On 21 March, AM Stirrup reported to Lord Bach that PJHQ had endorsed USURs </p>
<p>for 10 high&#8209;priority UORs for Phase IV, including maritime communications, aircraft </p>
<p>protection and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) capabilities.</p>

<p><b>55. </b> The full list of UORs, including 48 measures deemed to be “below the line”, was </p>
<p>awaiting confirmation of the CONOPS, which would be submitted to the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>the following week. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> AM Stirrup provided an update to the Chiefs of Staff on 28 March.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> He asked the </p>
<p>Chiefs to note that 65 potential UORs had been identified, of which 33 were “likely to </p>
<p>be needed in any aftermath scenario”, the other 32 were on hold until the “way ahead” </p>
<p>became clearer.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> The potential UORs identified included requirements for force protection </p>
<p>(such as Defensive Aids Suite for air transport and support helicopters), infrastructure </p>
<p>enhancements, and ISTAR enhancements to aid drawdown. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> Phase IV UORs were “being co&#8209;ordinated with the developing policy on </p>
<p>recuperation”.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> AM Stirrup stated: </p>
<p>“Despite the understandable lack of clarity over CONOPS for Phase IV, we are </p>
<p>making every effort to get ahead of the game.”</p>
<p><b>60. </b> The MOD’s preliminary discussions with the Treasury about Phase IV funding </p>
<p>indicated that officials would “agree to some further access to the Reserve”. It was </p>
<p>unclear whether that would be sufficient to cover the 65 measures already identified </p>
<p>or whether the criteria for access to the Reserve would encompass the full range of </p>
<p>measures to be sought. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> The MOD intended to make “a formal approach to the Treasury within the next </p>
<p>week”. Depending on the outcome, AM Stirrup wrote: “ … we may have to prioritise </p>
<p>Phase IV UORs further and/or to make adjustments to in&#8209;year priorities to accommodate </p>
<p>remaining measures within the Defence budget.”</p>
<p><b>62. </b> AM Stirrup stated:</p>
<p>“Unlike previous UOR tranches, we have no firm time by which Phase IV measures </p>
<p>have to be effective if they are to qualify for consideration. We are, though, using </p>
<p>a yardstick of six months as a guideline. Where measures have a longer lead time </p>
<p>(for example Defensive Aids Suite on large aircraft), we will need to address them </p>
<p>within the normal EP process.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Lt Gen Reith sent an assessment of the threat in the UK’s Area of Operations to </p>
<p>Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, CDS, on 29 March.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> In his covering minute, Lt Gen Reith </p>
<p>wrote that predictions about the latter stages of Phases III and IV were “more difficult to </p>
<p>ascertain” and they largely depended on “the progress of the Coalition campaign, forces </p>
<p>assigned to security tasks, etc”. He continued:</p>
<p>“However, for the moment we are dealing with a spectrum of threats ranging from </p>
<p>regular to terrorism. As we progress operations the regular forces threat will be </p>
<p>eliminated and we will eventually be left with a residual terrorist threat, as is already </p>
<p>the case in some areas we control, such as Umm Qasr.”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> The assessment stated that the threat, in addition to the indirect threats posed by </p>
<p>surface to surface missiles, fell broadly into three categories:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Conventional forces where Coalition Forces do not hold ground and RA </p>
<p>[Iraqi Regular Army] forces are still deployed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Asymmetric forces” including Fedayeen, Ba’ath Party officials and militia, </p>
<p>“other regime officials”, opportunists and criminals and the dissatisfied population.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Foreign terrorists including Palestinian and “other committed Islamic groups” </p>
<p>and the Iraq&#8209;based Iranian dissident group Mujahideen e Khalq (MEK) who were </p>
<p>“known” to operate in the South of Iraq. There was “no physical evidence of </p>
<p>these threats materialising as yet”.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> On 3 April, Lt Gen Reith produced a draft “operational concept” for Phase IV.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wrote that Phase IV operations would begin in southern Iraq “within days” but that </p>
<p>the backdrop to their implementation was “uncertain and changing”. The baseline </p>
<p>conditions from which they would operate were “far from clear” and “important issues”, </p>
<p>such as the level of military involvement, remained unresolved. While the paper detailed </p>
<p>the military’s potential tasks and capability, its focus was on force levels and it did not </p>
<p>cover equipment.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> The Inquiry has seen no evidence of any further comments on the draft.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> The record of Lord Bach’s meeting on 14 April stated:</p>
<p>“Phase IV UORs remain a problem. Although CJO [Lt Gen Reith] has a draft in hand, </p>
<p>we are still without a defined CONOPS. This limits our ability to plan for and procure </p>
<p>such items.”</p>

<p><b>68. </b> It is not clear precisely when the draft was finalised, but Lt Gen Reith stated in </p>
<p>a paper on 14 April that the operational concept had been agreed.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> The development </p>
<p>of the operational concept is addressed in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Lt Gen Reith produced two papers on the roulement and recovery of UK forces.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the operational requirement for UK land forces he wrote:</p>
<p>“In broad terms a mix of capabilities will be needed at each ‘strongpoint’, providing </p>
<p>the local commander with maximum flexibility. This will include the retention of some </p>
<p>armour, armoured/mechanised infantry and artillery support, but would increasingly </p>
<p>rely on operations ‘amongst the people’ on foot. The ability to ‘find’ and remove </p>
<p>hostile elements is critical; ISTAR/HUMINT [human intelligence] will continue to </p>
<p>be required. Reserves, in some cases with mobility provided by hels [helicopters], </p>
<p>would be required to surge into rural areas … Force protection requirements are </p>
<p>likely to increase as the UK occupies permanent bases. Additional companies may </p>
<p>be needed to provide security, possibly provided by the TA.”</p>
<p><b>70. </b> For battlefield helicopters, Lt Gen Reith suggested that the main force should </p>
<p>consist of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>five Chinook;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>five Sea King or Puma; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>five Lynx, with Sea King and Puma operating only at night, or some eight </p>
<p>Chinook, but with “potential longer term ramifications for the fleet”. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> Lt Gen Reith suggested that Lynx could be used to provide aerial surveillance but </p>
<p>that the deployment of Puma, Gazelle or an Islander aircraft would be “more sensible” </p>
<p>although they could “only be provided at the expense of the capability currently deployed </p>
<p>in Northern Ireland”.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> On equipment husbandry, Lt Gen Reith stated:</p>
<p>“Time and cost prevent the procurement of further environment and protection UOR </p>
<p>enhancements to equipment. This will require the majority of combat vehicles to </p>
<p>remain in theatre.”</p>
<p><b>73. </b> On 15 April, Lt Gen Reith produced an SOR for South&#8209;East Iraq for the Chiefs of </p>
<p>Staff.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> In an annex there was an assessment of each of the provinces under the UK’s </p>
<p>Area of Responsibility (AOR), including a judgement on the levels of consent to the </p>
<p>Coalition amongst the local population. That was used as an indicator of whether or </p>
<p>not the Coalition faced any threat of attack. </p>

<p>16</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Lt Gen Reith assessed that all provinces coming under the UK’s AOR would be at </p>
<p>least “relatively stable” with “medium&#8209;high” or “high” levels of consent to the Coalition </p>
<p>amongst the local population. </p>
<p><b>75. </b> In a separate annex, there was a table of UK force requirements which assessed </p>
<p>that the helicopters required were three Chinook, three Lynx and three Puma or Sea King. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> By 9 May, the MOD had approved 18 Phase IV measures at a cost of around £87m, </p>
<p>and a further 12 were being processed.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>77. </b> On 30 May, a list of all the equipment capability UORs approved for the </p>
<p>pre&#8209;deployment and invasion phases were sent around the MOD with an analysis of how </p>
<p>they did or did not address equipment capability gaps.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> It sought to determine where </p>
<p>UOR activity was focused, “both in terms of the capability delivered and also in terms </p>
<p>of the relationship between UORs and the Equipment Programme”.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> The capability shortfalls addressed by UORs were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>network&#8209;enabled capability 31 percent;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>other 27 percent.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The analysis stated that the fact that almost a third of the UORs were required </p>
<p>to address shortfalls in network&#8209;enabled capability validated “the major balance of </p>
<p>investment shift undertaken” in the 2003 Equipment Programme (EP03). That also </p>

<p><b>82. </b> The study was endorsed in December and lead elements of the EC Branch </p>

<p>36</p>
<p> The MND(SE) EC Branch was formally established </p>
<p>in theatre on 24 February 2005, and was staffed by three staff officers.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> The EC Branch produced an ‘Initial Deployment Report’ on 10 June 2005, </p>
<p>considering its performance so far and making recommendations for its longer&#8209;term </p>
<p>role.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>84. </b> The report stated that the EC Branch initially performed “two discrete roles”. The first </p>
<p>was the provision of support to the UOR process, on behalf of MND(SE), by providing a </p>
<p>central focus for UOR activity and taking the lead in the co&#8209;ordination of requirements, </p>
<p>capturing activity and SOR staffing. The EC cell’s mandate did not explicitly state that </p>
<p>EC Branch could “engage authoritatively in UOR integration matters”. That had been </p>
<p>“identified as a key MND(SE) shortfall” in the report.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Although having no formal mandate to do so, the EC cell did engage in UOR </p>
<p>integration activity, which had meant creating appropriate structures and procedures to </p>
<p>support the effective integration of UOR capabilities. The cell established a “Capability </p>
<p>Integration Working Group (CIWG) framework, formalised Capability Integration Plans </p>
<p>(CIP), and ensuring that theatre capability issues were addressed across the Defence </p>
<p>Lines of Development (DLOD)”.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> That work had “already proven instrumental in </p>
<p>identifying a number of capability issues likely to have an adverse effect on theatre </p>
<p>operations” and in identifying action to mitigate those issues. The report stated that </p>
<p>the work would enable the EC cell to “deliver greater benefit than its current MND(SE) </p>
<p>focused role would normally permit”.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> In the report, the cell recommended that “a broader remit, acting on behalf of CJO” </p>
<p>would also enable the EC Branch to deliver greater benefit. The cell did not recommend </p>
<p>any changes to EC Branch staffing levels, “due to the continued evolution of the Branch </p>
<p>… and the awaited outcome of this report”.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The report contained a number of lessons:</p>

<p>The EC Branch was “constrained in its operation due to the lack of an agreed </p>

<p>implement the Standing Instruction from 26 November 2004.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, CJO from July </p>
<p>2004 to March 2006, described the role of PJHQ as:</p>
<p>“… to act as the interface between the in&#8209;theatre force and the MOD and Front Line </p>
<p>Commands (FLC), particularly in ensuring that the in&#8209;theatre force is provided with </p>
<p>the wherewithal to deliver its objectives. This required a constant dialogue at every </p>
<p>level, between the MOD, PJHQ, FLC and in&#8209;theatre force.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>89. </b> ACM Torpy wrote that he had “inherited a Joint force structure … that was </p>
<p>appropriately sized to deliver the military objectives” he had been given; and that the </p>
<p>in&#8209;theatre commanders, including the GOC MND (SE), were required to conduct a Force </p>
<p>Level Review every six months to “validate their force requirements”. Those reviews </p>
<p>were “undertaken in consultation with the PJHQ” and “presented to the CDS (and the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff) for endorsement”. That “imposed an important level of discipline” and </p>
<p>“provided the vehicle for force level increases if conditions in a particular component </p>
<p>demanded additional capability”. </p>
<p><b>90. </b> On 10 October 2006, the extent to which capability gaps were being anticipated </p>
<p>in UK theatres was raised by General Sir Timothy Granville&#8209;Chapman, Vice Chief of </p>
<p>Defence Staff, following a meeting about helicopter availability in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>91. </b> On 27 October, Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman’s Private Office wrote to Lieutenant </p>
<p>General Nicholas Houghton, CJO, requesting a report on “how effective we currently </p>
<p>are and how we might be more so” in predicting emerging capability requirements and </p>

<p><b>92. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman had recently discussed potential improvements with </p>
<p>Major General Richard Applegate, MOD Capability Manager (Battlespace Manoeuvre), </p>
<p>who thought:</p>
<p>“… we used to deploy people to theatres specifically to proactively keep current and </p>
<p>future requirements under review; the added advantage of this was that they could </p>
<p>also keep theatre informed of [sic] was being done for them at home, for example </p>
<p>on UORs.” </p>
<p><b>93. </b> Lt Gen Houghton replied on 9 November, inviting Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman to note:</p>
<p>“I intend to formalise the PJHQ procedures to deliver systematic and coherent </p>
<p>progress in conjunction with the MOD sponsored Capabilities Working Group … </p>
<p>“We still need to improve our processes for identifying the EC [Equipment Capability] </p>
<p>dimension of emerging theatre CONOPS which lay in the domain of the early years </p>
<p>of the EP [Equipment Programme] rather than in the UOR process.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>94. </b> Lt Gen Houghton wrote that the EC cell’s “primary purpose” was to identify all </p>
<p>capability requirements. Future capability definition was determined between PJHQ, </p>
<p>MND(SE),<b> </b>Multi&#8209;National Forces&#8209;Iraq (MNF&#8209;I) and the<b> </b>DECs. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> Lt Gen Houghton stated: “In my judgement, EC definition and requirements </p>
<p>management in Op TELIC is systematic, coherent and effective.”</p>
<p><b>96. </b> As a proposed improvement, Lt Gen Houghton stated:</p>
<p>“Better interaction between MOD staff and theatres would enhance comprehension </p>
<p>of the operating environment and keep theatre commanders abreast of progress.”</p>
<p><b>97. </b> In conclusion, Lt Gen Houghton stated:</p>
<p>“… I am not so convinced that we are as good at matching up the EC dimension of </p>
<p>emerging CONOPS in the slightly longer time&#8209;frame. We are looking at the issue, </p>
<p>which is central to the future role of the PJHQ in influencing the early years of the </p>
<p>EP, but beyond the time&#8209;frame which is appropriate for the UOR process.” </p>
<p><b>98. </b> In September 2007, the MOD’s Directorate of Operational Capability (DOC) </p>
<p>published an audit of force protection which highlighted the need for a better articulation </p>
<p>of the risk to which the military would be exposed during operations.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>99. </b> In November 2007, the MOD produced a force protection policy which has remained </p>
<p>under “constant review”.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> It is unclear from the evidence how many force protection </p>
<p>policies preceded this version but the MOD has been unable to find any individual force </p>
<p>protection policies before November 2007.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that the version dated 21 May 2015 “defines risk </p>
<p>ownership and governance more clearly than its predecessors”.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> The MOD said </p>
<p>that this had been integrated into wider MOD risk management processes which had </p>
<p>also been revised.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> The MOD said that the Operational Commander (which for Iraq was the CJO), was </p>
<p>accountable to CDS for understanding, quantifying and reducing risk to the force and </p>
<p>mission respectively. That risk response may require changes to activities or capabilities.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> On 31 August 2010, an analysis of the land operation in Iraq was published </p>
<p>on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff by Brigadier Ben Barry.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> It was known as </p>
<p>“the Barry Report”.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> On specifying equipment requirements, the report stated:</p>
<p>“It appears for much of this period the mechanism for formulating new capability </p>
<p>requirements was sub&#8209;optimal. Where there was a strong coherent sponsor in the </p>
<p>Army or MOD there was more chance of requirements being quickly identified and </p>
<p>UORs succeeding. Difficulties experienced at the start of this period [2005] were </p>
<p>overcome to a certain extent by fielding Equipment Capability staff to PJHQ and </p>
<p>Basra. But it was not clear who owned the medium term vision for the capability </p>
<p>requirements of the theatre and longer term thinking on equipment requirements </p>
<p>was inhibited by the lack of campaign continuity.” </p>
<p><b>104. </b> The report said that, where UORs succeeded, “some of these were the result of </p>
<p>‘pull’ from theatre, others the result of ‘push’ from equipment staff in the MOD. This was </p>
<p>the case with Mastiff, the requirement for which was formulated in London.” </p>
<p><b>105. </b> The report quoted evidence from Lt Gen Applegate:</p>
<p>“We must recognise that UORs were/are generally reactive and until about 2009 </p>
<p>when I managed to convince people to think in campaign terms, there was a </p>
<p>tendency to think only six months ahead: some of the solutions could not be </p>
<p>delivered in that timescale and were refused … our six&#8209;monthitis and lack of </p>
<p>a campaign design limited sufficient forward thinking.”</p>

<p>48</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The Army had an agreed requirement for a family of vehicles to replace existing </p>
<p>medium weight armoured vehicles, the Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) programme.</p>
<p><b>109. </b> In May 2002, AM Stirrup told the House of Commons Defence Committee that </p>
<p>FRES was designed to reflect the post&#8209;Cold War era.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> It would focus “much more upon </p>
<p>mobility, speed and precision than upon heaviness and armoured defence”. It would be </p>

<p><b>110. </b> On 23 July 2007, an MOD note stated that FRES was designed to fill a capability </p>
<p>gap by replacing the Saxon, Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) (CVR(T)) and </p>
<p>FV430 wheeled and tracked vehicles.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>111. </b> FRES comprised “five families”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>utility – wheeled armoured vehicles, principally to provide protected mobility;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>basic capability utility – vehicles that did not require the same capacity, </p>
<p>protection or mobility as the utility family and could therefore be procured  </p>
<p>more cheaply;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recce – tracked vehicles to replace the majority of the CVR(T) fleet;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>medium armour – a new capability for a tracked medium weight tank; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>manoeuvre support – tracked vehicles for general armoured engineering tasks.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>113. </b> General Sir Richard Dannatt, Assistant Chief of the General Staff from 2001 to </p>
<p>2002, told the Inquiry that in 2001&#8209;2002 “as we were moving towards an expeditionary </p>
<p>era” after the Cold War, the Army had identified a clear requirement for “vehicles that </p>
<p>were small and light enough to go into aircraft to be flown to trouble spots, but heavy </p>
<p>and capable enough to be useful and usable when they got there”.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> He said that formed </p>
<p>the basis of the FRES programme, which had been approved in 2002. </p>
<p><b>114. </b> Gen Dannatt described FRES as “a rapid programme”; an “urgent” </p>
<p>short&#8209;to&#8209;medium term requirement that “needed to be filled quite quickly”. In his view, </p>
<p>“85 percent of the solution delivered quickly would have been the right answer”. </p>
<p>The intention was “to go to the market and see what was out there and procure it”:</p>
<p>“… our aspiration in 2002 was that FRES, the utility vehicle, would come into service </p>
<p>from as early from 2007 and better if we could do it, and the money was there </p>
<p>because we had made the money available.”</p>
<p><b>115. </b> On 26 June 2003, the DMB considered a “thinkpiece” paper from Mr Colin </p>
<p>Balmer, MOD Finance Director, about what strategic guidance the DMB might offer on </p>
<p>investment priorities for 2004’s Equipment Programme (STP/EP04).</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> It said that the </p>
<p>MOD faced some “difficult choices” in a year where its “financial freedom of manoeuvre” </p>
<p>would be “limited”. There would be “no new resources to distribute”, despite a range of </p>
<p>cost pressures and new risks emerging.</p>
<p><b>116. </b> Mr Balmer suggested that some areas of the Equipment Programme represented </p>
<p>“vital ground” and “should be protected”. Those included network&#8209;enabled capability, </p>
<p>deployable ISTAR, Combat ID, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical protection capabilities </p>
<p>and logistics. He wrote that DMB “might also endorse the need to re&#8209;examine ISD and </p>
<p>platform numbers against the DPAs with a view to establishing the effect of a deferral </p>
<p>… or reductions”. Amongst others, that review would specifically consider the FRES </p>
<p>programme.</p>
<p><b>117. </b> The Equipment Programme for 2003 had “continued a shift from quantity to quality” </p>
<p>and was consequently “much better balanced” than it had been but “significant shortfalls” </p>
<p>remained. It did, however, have “serious” issues of affordability resulting from “formally </p>
<p>programmed excesses, unanticipated pressures and industrial factors”. The current </p>
<p>forecasts suggested that £4bn would need to be cut from the programme over 10 years </p>
<p>to bring it in line with the allocated resource. The MOD also needed “to obtain a better </p>
<p>understanding of the non&#8209;cash costs of ownership of the growing equipment programme, </p>
<p>to ensure that it is affordable in resource terms”. </p>

<p><b>118. </b> Mr Balmer’s paper was endorsed by DMB on 26 June, which said it should be used </p>
<p>as a basis for STP/EP04, although any policy decisions would be considered more fully </p>
<p>later in the planning round.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>119. </b> At the time of the invasion of Iraq, the Protected Patrol Vehicles (PPVs) in service </p>
<p>with the Army were Snatch and Tavern. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> By 2002, Snatch was already at the end of its planned life In Service.</p>
<p><b>What is a Protected Patrol Vehicle (PPV)?</b></p>
<p>A Protected Patrol Vehicle (PPV) is a wheeled vehicle, that provides some ballistic </p>
<p>protection to personnel inside.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PPVs were initially designed to carry four people, although more recent models, such </p>
<p>as the Mastiff, can carry 10 people. The PPV’s purpose is to enable a combination of </p>
<p>foot and vehicle&#8209;mounted patrols; generally, but not exclusively, within peace support/</p>
<p>counter&#8209;insurgency operations. That is distinct from heavier, Armoured Fighting Vehicles </p>
<p>(AFVs), which are primarily designed for combat.<b> </b>A PPV must enable one (ideally two) top </p>
<p>cover sentries to observe the environment when mobile. PPVs are expected to be able </p>
<p>to operate on roads and tracks and need to be agile. </p>
<p>A PPV has to maintain freedom of manoeuvre and mobility to patrol in both urban and </p>
<p>semi&#8209;rural environments. PPVs provide a less aggressive profile than AFVs, thereby </p>
<p>enabling the patrol to be more engaged with local populations. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> The Snatch Land Rover was designed for operations in Northern Ireland and </p>
<p>entered service in 1992.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> It was also deployed in limited numbers to Kosovo and </p>
<p>Macedonia<b>. </b></p>
<p><b>122. </b> In March 2000, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency provided advice to </p>
<p>the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) about the limited levels of protection afforded </p>
<p>by the vehicle.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“The vehicle was also tested against the RPG 7 [Rocket Propelled Grenade 7] and </p>
<p>improvised grenades, as would be expected it does not offer full protection from this </p>
<p>type of device.”</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Lieutenant General Graeme Lamb, GOC MND(SE) from July 2003 to December </p>
<p>2003, told the Inquiry that “in Northern Ireland we didn’t drive vehicles south of </p>
<p>whichever line it was for 20 years because of the threat of massive IEDs [Improvised </p>
<p>Explosive Devices] that were being placed in the road”.</p>

<p>24</p>
<p><b>124. </b> The replacement of Snatch Land Rovers, and Tavern, was being addressed </p>
<p>through Project DUCKBOARD, a programme pursing the provision of light protected </p>
<p>mobility vehicles for counter&#8209;terrorist and public order operations in Northern Ireland </p>
<p>from 2007&#8209;2008 onwards.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>125. </b> A draft User Statement of Requirement (USUR) for Project DUCKBOARD </p>
<p>produced on 7 January 2002 said:</p>
<p>“The current NI [Northern Ireland] patrol vehicles are essential for troop deployment, </p>
<p>patrolling urban and rural areas and for administrative tasks. They were procured </p>
<p>to counter the threat from low and high velocity small arms, Improvised Explosive </p>
<p>Devices (IED), anti&#8209;armour weapons, petrol bombs and general hand&#8209;held </p>
<p>catapulted missiles. In order to afford the troops on the ground an acceptable level </p>
<p>of protection, mobility and capacity to counter the threat two vehicles are currently </p>
<p>in service, Tavern in the high risk areas and Snatch in the lower risk areas.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>126. </b> The USUR noted that the End Service Date for Snatch was 2002 but it was </p>
<p>anticipated that would need to be extended. It concluded that as vehicles arising out  </p>
<p>of Project DUCKBOARD entered service, Snatch and Tavern would be phased out  </p>
<p>of service. </p>
<p><b>Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)</b></p>
<p>The features and capabilities of a vehicle, or any other platform, are only one element  </p>
<p>of protection.</p>
<p>The military rely on Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to avoid being located, </p>
<p>identified or targeted. Devising successful TTPs is part of trying to make UK forces as safe </p>
<p>as possible from the likelihood of attack.</p>
<p>Military platforms are provided with other features to act as an additional layer of </p>
<p>protection in the event that the TTPs are not successful. This could mean armour being </p>
<p>placed on the outside of a vehicle, electronic countermeasures, or it could be enhanced </p>
<p>surveillance equipment. A solution cannot be applied universally but will depend on the </p>
<p>nature of the threat.</p>

<p>DEPLOYING PPVS TO IRAQ</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Despite the decision in the 1998 SDR to shift the focus towards a capability for </p>
<p>expeditionary operations, no concept of operations for PPVs had been identified in </p>
<p>mid&#8209;2003 and there were no definitive timescales for the provision of vehicles. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> PPVs were not deployed during the invasion of Iraq and unarmoured Land Rovers </p>
<p>were initially used for patrols. </p>
<p><b>129. </b> The MOD Directorate [of] Equipment Capability (Special Projects) (DEC(SP)) </p>
<p>hosted a PPV workshop on 16 July 2003.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> It was attended by MOD teams and </p>
<p>stakeholders, including representatives from Headquarters Land Forces. </p>
<p><b>130. </b> A DEC(SP) representative “reiterated his belief that the capability gap was </p>
<p>essentially three fold:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>the enduring NI [Northern Ireland] type requirement;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>the emerging wider requirement for light forces engaged on operations such </p>
<p>as in the Balkans and in Iraq;</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>the enduring requirement for protected mobility for specialist users such as </p>
<p>Royal Engineers Explosive Ordinance Disposal …”</p>
<p><b>131. </b> A range of procurement options for a capability to meet the requirement were </p>
<p>set out at the workshop, including options to extend the life of Snatch by 10 years, </p>
<p>a commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf purchase or the up&#8209;armouring of an in&#8209;service vehicle such </p>
<p>as the Pinzgauer. </p>
<p><b>132. </b> It was agreed at the meeting that a coherent statement of the concept of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>What is an Improvised Explosive Device (IED)?</b></p>
<p>An IED is a bomb constructed and activated in ways other than through conventional </p>
<p>military action. The types most commonly encountered in Iraq were:</p>
<p><b>Radio&#8209;Controlled IED (RCIED):</b> This uses a radio signal to initiate detonation – a number </p>

<p> Radio&#8209;controlled detonation meant that an explosion on a specific </p>
<p>target could be initiated by an operator situated a safe distance away. Those were the </p>
<p>most commonly used type of IED in Iraq between 2003 and mid&#8209;2005. UK electronic </p>
<p>countermeasures were used to jam the detonation signal.</p>
<p><b>Command Wire IED (CWIED):</b> This uses a wire to transmit the signal to detonate.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> It is </p>
<p>a retrograde form of technology and had the disadvantage of requiring a wire dug into the </p>
<p>ground, or concealment through other means, but they became more common in Iraq from </p>
<p>2006 onwards as they were immune to any form of electronic countermeasure.</p>
<p><b>Explosively Formed Projectile (EFP):</b> A directional charge designed to defeat armour </p>
<p>by using the energy of the explosive to create a projectile that travels at between one and </p>
<p>three kilometres per second towards its target.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> EFPs were commonly used as charges </p>
<p>for IEDs in Iraq from mid&#8209;2004 onwards.</p>
<p><b>Passive Infrared IED (PIR IED): </b>An evolution from RCIEDs where passive infrared </p>
<p>beams are used remotely to detonate IEDs. The first of those attacks in MND(SE) was in </p>
<p>May 2005 and indicated an attempt to circumvent the UK’s electronic countermeasures.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> On 2 July 2003, the JIC issued an Assessment about potential flashpoints in Iraq </p>
<p>over the next two to three years.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> It focused on “potential negative outcomes rather </p>
<p>than positive ones”. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> The JIC judged that extremist groups currently posed a direct threat to Coalition </p>
<p>Forces, but:</p>
<p>“For now, the activities of these groups are largely unco&#8209;ordinated. However, it is </p>
<p>likely that the links between groups will become stronger.” </p>
<p><b>137. </b> The Assessment stated that there had been no sign of an organised campaign </p>
<p>of violence against Coalition Forces by Shia groups “so far”. There had, however, </p>
<p>been reports that the two main armed Shia groups (the Badr Corps and the followers </p>
<p>of Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr) had “recently been trying to acquire large quantities of weapons”. </p>
<p>The JIC stated that there were indications that they were “preparing for intra&#8209;Shia conflict </p>
<p>(as opposed to anti&#8209;Coalition activity)”. That would add to instability and it was “probable” </p>
<p>that Coalition Forces would “be caught up in violence”. </p>

<p>Lebanese Hizballah had “a small but threatening presence in Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… although Iran would prefer to influence developments in Iraq by taking </p>
<p>advantage of the political process”, it would “retain the option of causing trouble </p>
<p>for the Coalition”.</p>
<p><b>139. </b> On 7 July, a Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) paper, circulated at a working level </p>
<p>within the MOD, stated that Radio&#8209;Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs) and their components had </p>
<p>been found in the UK Area of Operations since early April.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> The paper did not speculate </p>
<p>on the origin of the material.</p>
<p><b>140. </b> On 30 July, Lt Gen Reith informed the Chiefs of Staff that there was “an increasing </p>
<p>use of more sophisticated IEDs, and attacks against Iraqi police and locals employed by </p>
<p>the Coalition”.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> There was a discussion about whether the UK should support the US in </p>
<p>developing RCIED countermeasures and Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief </p>
<p>of Defence Staff (Commitments), was directed to “assess the scope of the issue”.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> It was reported at the next Chiefs of Staff meeting on 6 August that Lt Gen Fry’s </p>
<p>paper had been postponed “pending further consultation”.</p>

<p>to establish an IED intelligence cell to provide an “immediate in theatre threat analysis </p>
<p>of IEDs”. </p>
<p><b>143. </b> A DIS paper produced on 31 July recorded that RCIEDs had been used in the UK </p>
<p>Area of Operations around Basra on 14 and 28 July:</p>
<p>“The former Iraqi regime had a proven advanced IED capability including RC </p>
<p>methods … Latterly there have been many (double figures) attacks against Coalition </p>
<p>Forces believed to have involved RCIEDs, as well as significant finds of RC&#8209;related </p>
<p>hardware … </p>
<p>“There are a large number of former regime and ex&#8209;military personnel skilled </p>
<p>in constructing and deploying IEDs who remain at large within Iraq and their </p>
<p>involvement in RCIED incidents would raise the level of threat. There is also the </p>
<p>potential for foreign groups opposed to the Coalition presence to appear within Iraq </p>
<p>and become engaged in attacks. If organisations such as Hizballah (that has an </p>
<p>extremely potent and proven RCIED capability) were to do this, then the RC threat </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>144. </b> A PJHQ operational summary from 4 August recorded:</p>
<p>“The use of IEDs against Coalition Forces is increasing and there remains no </p>
<p>shortage of raw materials across Iraq from which to draw upon.”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>145. </b> On 7 August, Mr Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, told the </p>
<p>Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation that: “Improvised Explosive Devices </p>
<p>posed an increasing threat.”</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>146. </b> In August 2003, the security situation in Baghdad continued to deteriorate. </p>
<p>A bomb exploded outside the UN headquarters on 19 August, killing 22 UN staff and </p>
<p>visitors. Further attacks included a bomb outside the Jordanian Embassy and several </p>
<p>unsuccessful attempts to shoot down Coalition aircraft. </p>
<p><b>147. </b> The implications of those attacks are addressed in Section 9.2.</p>
<p><b>148. </b> On 27 August, the Chiefs of Staff were briefed that Maj Gen Lamb was reviewing </p>
<p>manpower and equipment requirements.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) </p>
<p>was “constrained by force protection” and:</p>
<p>“Although they had ordered armoured vehicles and were reviewing security until </p>
<p>this was in place, they were confined to the barracks. Unless a plan drawn up by </p>
<p>experts, managed by technically qualified personnel, was put immediately into </p>
<p>action, then the consent of the people in the MND(SE) AO [Area of Operations] </p>
<p>could be irrevocably lost with all the consequences of strategic failure.”</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Anthony Bagnall, Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, invited </p>
<p>Major General Robin Brims, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations, to “remind theatre that </p>
<p>the question of force protection needed to be looked at in the broadest way, taking into </p>
<p>account not only local expediencies but also strategic implications”, especially when </p>
<p>taking decisions about helmets and body armour.</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Maj Gen Brims pointed out that “the British Army did not have any wheeled </p>
<p>vehicles with sufficient armour against the threat”. ACM Bagnall invited Air Vice Marshal </p>
<p>Clive Loader, Assistant Chief of Defence Staff (Operations), to investigate the issue. </p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Air Staff, pointed out that “what was </p>
<p>important was knowing what may be required in advance so that any enhancements </p>
<p>could be put in place quickly”.</p>
<p><b>151. </b> On 1 September, MND(SE) produced a Forces and Resources Review to examine </p>

<p><b>152. </b> The Review noted that CPA(South) had “yet to extend its influence” beyond Basra </p>
<p>City. The arrival of Sir Hilary Synnott as Head of Coalition Provisional Authority (South) </p>
<p>was the “first recent sign of this state of affairs improving; but without the people, </p>
<p>protected mobility, communications and life support Sir Hilary will not have the means at </p>
<p>his disposal to implement the changes he requires”. It said that Governorate Teams were </p>
<p>also “under resourced” and “barely exist” outside Basra.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> In the short term, 16 vehicles were recommended (four Land Rovers and 12 white </p>
<p>fleet 4x4s</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>) to support the staff in Governorate Teams. There was an additional </p>
<p>requirement for six “stripped down Land Rovers to provide top cover escorts” for </p>
<p>CPA(South) staff operating inside Basra City, including for consultants. </p>
<p><b>154. </b> The Review stated that the enduring requirement for greater surveillance capability </p>
<p>was “urgent”. The existing force protection measures limited the ability to “observe a </p>
<p>situation from the ground”. </p>
<p><b>155. </b> The Review articulated the requirement for light protected mobility: </p>
<p>“The threat posed to CF [Coalition Forces] within Basra City from IED, RPG and </p>
<p>small arms attacks is currently being countered by the use of stripped&#8209;down </p>
<p>Land Rovers with top cover sentries. This necessarily carries a risk to the top cover </p>
<p>vehicles from attack, particularly from IEDs. Force protection will be improved by </p>
<p>the provision of up&#8209;armoured 4x4 vehicles that meet the broad definitions below. </p>
<p>Replacing the full complement of this in the UK Bde [brigade] would require of </p>
<p>the order of 420 vehicles. The minimum quantity to provide essential protected </p>
<p>movement in Basra and Maysan is 228. Any lower number will be put to good use </p>
<p>in accordance with priorities. The requirement is for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An agile wheeled vehicle capable of swift acceleration and speed in excess </p>
<p>of 60 mph.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A high degree of protection against small arms fire and blast devices.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A cupola to allow top cover protection to deter attackers, particularly those </p>
<p>deploying anti&#8209;armour weapons and small arms.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… [G]rills to give windows protection against thrown objects, both to enhance </p>
<p>routine protection and to enable its use in public order situations where a Warrior  </p>
<p>[AFV] may be too threatening or unable to manoeuvre in small streets.”</p>
<p><b>156. </b> The Review also “strongly recommended” that at least one battlegroup in each UK </p>
<p>brigade be equipped with four companies</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> of Warrior as it was the “only infantry vehicle </p>
<p>with protection against RPG”.</p>
<p>73 </p>
<p>A white fleet 4x4 is an unarmoured Army vehicle.</p>
<p>74 </p>
<p>A military company is a type of military unit that consists of between 80 and 250 soldiers.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Maj Gen Brims provided a written update to the Chiefs of Staff on the Forces and </p>
<p>Resources Review on 2 September.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“The deployment of protected mobility is key to improving the FP [force protection] </p>
<p>available to soldiers and to enabling the posture of the force to be changed to meet </p>
<p>emerging threats. The initial assessment is that a minimum of 228 vehicles will </p>
<p>be required – further detailed work is still needed to identify the most appropriate </p>
<p>platform from those that have been identified as being available and it may be that </p>
<p>an ‘in&#8209;service’ quick fix is required using NI [Northern Ireland] and pool assets.”</p>
<p><b>158. </b> The Review was discussed by the Chiefs of Staff on 3 September.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> General </p>
<p>Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), directed that the request for </p>
<p>additional Snatch vehicles should be met by drawing from the Northern Ireland reserve </p>
<p>battalions in the first instance.</p>
<p><b>159. </b> On 4 September, Mr Hoon’s Private Office sent a letter to No.10 setting out the </p>
<p>outcome of the Forces and Resources Review.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> It stated that roughly 1,200 servicemen </p>
<p>and women were being deployed; an “early increase of 12 percent to the UK forces </p>
<p>currently in theatre”. The extra personnel would be supported by the “deployment of a </p>
<p>quantity of armoured patrol vehicles, some of which will be drawn from Northern Ireland”. </p>
<p>That would have “a limited, but manageable effect” on the UK’s ability to “conduct </p>
<p>current operations in support of the PSNI [Police Service of Northern Ireland]”.</p>
<p><b>160. </b> On 5 September, a further meeting of the PPV Working Group was held “to </p>
<p>develop a list of issues and associated options to meet the perceived requirement for </p>
<p>the future deployment of PPV in support of Op TELIC”.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>161. </b> The record of the meeting stated that the “initial verbal request” was for </p>
<p>228 vehicles for delivery to Iraq within two weeks, as per the Forces and Resources </p>
<p>Review. All representatives present at the meeting agreed that was an “unrealistic” </p>
<p>timetable. A DEC(SP) representative set out a phased approach to meeting the </p>
<p>requirement, the final phase being that enough vehicles were provided for two brigades.</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Whilst there was currently no SOR, information provided from theatre indicated </p>
<p>a requirement “closely aligned to those for the Tavern/Snatch vehicles currently in use </p>
<p>in Northern Ireland”. A footnote stated:</p>
<p>“Due to the limited Tavern fleet and the expected high cost of procuring similar </p>
<p>vehicles, the PPV protection requirement must be realistic in order to permit a timely </p>
<p>and cost effective solution to the UOR.” </p>

<p>31</p>
<p><b>163. </b> To meet the immediate requirement of 228 vehicles, the merits of deploying either </p>
<p>Snatch or Tavern were debated including on the grounds of protection, mobility, capacity </p>
<p>and sustainability. The need for climate modifications and communications adaptations </p>
<p>was also considered. </p>
<p><b>164. </b> The Group concluded that Snatch was the preferred option because there were </p>
<p>Integrated Logistic Support issues and reliability concerns with Tavern. It acknowledged </p>
<p>that the “protection levels afforded by Snatch may not meet the requirement to counter </p>
<p>the local threat”. </p>
<p><b>165. </b> Other solutions considered were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>fitting the in&#8209;service Wolf (a Land Rover variant) or Pinzgauer with appliqué </p>
<p>armour – discounted because of the scarcity of suitable vehicles; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>refurbishing the Armoured Patrol Vehicle (APV)1.5 awaiting disposal – </p>
<p>discounted because of the poor mechanical condition of the fleet and the </p>
<p>“political implications” of utilising equipment marked for disposal;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>refurbishing Snatch – discounted as an immediate response because of the </p>
<p>timescales and level of technical risk but considered a possible long&#8209;term </p>
<p>solution to Project DUCKBOARD; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>procuring new vehicles – discounted as an immediate response because of </p>
<p>the timescales but considered a valid solution in the medium&#8209;to&#8209;long term.</p>
<p><b>166. </b> The Group recommended that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the deployment of Snatch be taken forward to meet the timescale for the </p>
<p>provision of 228 vehicles for Iraq in four weeks; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new vehicle purchase, with protection levels similar to or better than Snatch, </p>
<p>be considered to meet the requirement of enough vehicles for two brigades </p>
<p>within four to six months. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> 180 Snatch Land Rovers were dispatched from Northern Ireland to Iraq on </p>
<p>11 September.</p>

<p>32</p>
<p>said he “was acutely aware that … Snatch was not designed [for 21st century urban </p>

<p><b>170. </b> Lt Gen Lamb added:</p>
<p>“Yet … what have you got available at short order? Well … better have a Snatch </p>

<p><b>171. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff (CGS) from February 2003 to </p>
<p>August 2006, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Snatch Land Rovers were deployed to Iraq because they were available or could </p>
<p>be made available as we drew down from Northern Ireland, and without them it </p>
<p>would have been completely soft&#8209;skinned Land Rovers. That’s where the state of the </p>

<p><b>The appearance of Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs) and the </b></p>

<p><b>172. </b> A JIC Assessment on 3 September judged that the security environment would </p>
<p>“remain poor” and “probably worsen over the next year”.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> The JIC stated that the </p>
<p>“most frequent attacks” had been against Coalition Forces and “increasingly” were from </p>
<p>small IEDs. Those using them had “shown growing competence, determination and </p>
<p>sophistication”. The JIC assessed that IED attacks would become more effective. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> The JIC judged that Shia consent was “fragile and eroding”. The guidance </p>
<p>of “senior Iraqi Shia clerics” had been “to give the Coalition a year”, but the recent </p>
<p>attacks were “likely to have shortened this timeline substantially”. If acquiescence </p>
<p>turned to hostility, that “would have the most serious consequences for the security </p>
<p>situation, particularly in southern Iraq”. If the Coalition was “perceived to be impotent”, </p>
<p>the Shia would “take law and order into their own hands”. Reporting indicated that </p>
<p>supporters of the Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr were “acquiring weapons” and “planning attacks </p>
<p>on Coalition targets”. </p>
<p><b>174. </b> In addition, the JIC judged that Iran and Hizballah were: </p>
<p>“… probably inciting violent anti&#8209;Coalition protests and other disruptive activity. </p>
<p>Their incitement probably falls short of directly ordering attacks on Coalition Forces. </p>
<p>But after the death of Ayatollah al&#8209;Hakim [the leader of the Supreme Council for </p>
<p>Islamic Revolution in Iraq], Iran will be reconsidering its approach.” </p>

<p>33</p>
<p><b>175. </b> In September, the DIS produced a review of the major threats from IEDs in Iraq, </p>
<p>intended “to provide analysis and outlook on current terrorist activities”.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> The review </p>
<p>emphasised Iraq’s “long history of state sponsored manufacture of complex IEDs,  </p>
<p>as in the case of the failed 1993 ‘Bush Bomb’”, and stated that the regime had used an </p>
<p>“IED strategy” as a means of extending domestic and foreign policy. During the conflict </p>
<p>there had been significant finds of radio&#8209;controlled hardware and:</p>
<p>“All indications show that the Iraqi regime planned to continue to adapt its well tested </p>
<p>pre&#8209;conflict IED strategy and production methods in a guerrilla conflict after the </p>
<p>regime capitulated …”</p>
<p><b>176. </b> The review stated that RCIEDs accounted for around 50 percent of all IED </p>
<p>incidents. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> On 25 September, the JIC reported that attacks against Coalition Forces in the </p>
<p>South were at the “lowest level since June” but it also judged that Shia militias were </p>
<p>emerging in the South.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> The tactics of armed groups in Iraq continued to evolve, </p>
<p>“including the increased use of more sophisticated IEDs and more elaborate attacks”. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> A JIC Assessment on 15 October stated that the South remained “relatively </p>
<p>calm”, although some former regime elements were aiming to “foment greater unrest”.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The JIC noted that reporting that indicated “the return of a specific bomb maker to </p>
<p>Basra” was of “particular concern”. </p>
<p><b>179. </b> On 5 November, the JIC reported that the situation in the South remained </p>
<p>“relatively calm” but there had been a spate of IED attacks in Basra province in </p>
<p>mid&#8209;October including one using a sophisticated remote control device.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> The JIC also </p>
<p>stated that IEDs were the “single most common form of attack” in Iraq, that they were </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Williams wrote that the deterioration in Iraq’s security had led “to an increase </p>
<p>in demand for force protection measures, including armoured (Land Rover type) patrol </p>
<p>vehicles and specialist counter&#8209;terrorist equipment”. He said that, although the MOD </p>
<p>had looked at utilising Northern Ireland’s resources to meet the requirement, there was </p>
<p>a need to ensure that the equipment was “appropriate to the threat in Iraq”. He added: </p>
<p>“Some development effort is likely to be required.” </p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Williams outlined the requirement in an attached annex: </p>
<p>“The most serious threat facing UK personnel in Iraq (military and civilian) is </p>
<p>that from Radio&#8209;Controlled (RC) IEDs. It took PIRA [the Provisional IRA] some </p>
<p>years to develop RCIEDs and associated tactics successfully. By contrast, as a </p>
<p>result of state&#8209;sponsored activity, FRL (Former Regime Loyalists) forces, already </p>
<p>well equipped and experienced, were able to mount attacks of similar technical </p>
<p>sophistication in Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere in Iraq without a pause after the </p>
<p>fall of the Ba’athist Regime … A further trend is evident in theatre: terrorist attacks </p>
<p>(and tactics and equipment) may be trialled in the US area, but it does not take them </p>
<p>long to appear in the UK area.”</p>
<p><b>183. </b> The annex referred to evidence that between 11 July and 31 October 2003 there </p>
<p>were 28 IEDs detected in MND(SE); of those, nine employed remote detonation. </p>
<p>It stated that one UK serviceman had been killed</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> and there were “various degrees of </p>
<p>injury to UK personnel”. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> In the US&#8209;controlled areas, IED attacks were occurring at a rate of around 10 per </p>
<p>day, with 80 percent of those being radio&#8209;controlled.</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Mr Williams explained that, whilst some existing ECM equipment was effective </p>
<p>against threats in Iraq, the most significant threats were new and therefore required </p>
<p>a new response. He stated that only about 25 percent of UK vehicles would need to be </p>
<p>fitted with equipment on the basis that vehicles moved in groups for mutual protection. </p>
<p>He cautioned that, “owing to the high level of its security classification, and the restricted </p>
<p>industrial base, there are limits to the manufacture rate” and stated that the first new </p>
<p>equipment would arrive in Iraq in December 2003. </p>
<p><b>186. </b> On 6 January 2004, a briefing note sent to Mr Hoon and Gen Walker stated that </p>
<p>the Treasury had “recently agreed” to fund the £73m for Project L*.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>187. </b> The question of how that funding could be met was part of wider, ongoing </p>
<p>discussions with the Treasury which are referred to later in this Section and set out </p>
<p>in Section 13.1. </p>

<p><b>188. </b> On 16 January, the UOR business case to modify existing Snatch vehicles for </p>
<p>deployment in Iraq was approved.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> The case for the “desertisation” of vehicles was at </p>
<p>a cost of £2.2m, with a completion date of May 2004. The modified version of Snatch </p>
<p>became known as the “Snatch 1.5” variant. </p>
<p><b>189. </b> The business case stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While the requirement had originally been for 228 vehicles, only 208 Snatch </p>
<p>were available “without an unmanageable impact” on Northern Ireland </p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Recent attacks have highlighted the need for protected mobility capable </p>
<p>of providing protection from small arms and IEDs.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Snatch was not designed for expeditionary operations and modifications to </p>
<p>its communications and air conditioning were required for operations in Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The modifications were “a short&#8209;term solution to meet immediate needs”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DEC(SP) was reviewing options to provide a more durable medium&#8209;term </p>
<p>solution, funded from the core equipment programme, “for introduction not </p>
<p>before late 2004/2005”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The other protective vehicles in use, Challenger 2, Warrior, CVR(T) and Saxon, </p>
<p>were “not available in sufficient numbers, nor are they appropriate to the majority </p>
<p>of tasks due to profile and size”. </p>
<p><b>190. </b> Lieutenant General Andrew Ridgway, Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), briefed </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff on the IED threat on 21 January.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> He stated: </p>
<p>“Although it was assessed that the transfer of terrorist technology from North to </p>
<p>South Iraq meant MND(SE) could expect an increased threat from IEDs, there was </p>
<p>still no evidence of a co&#8209;ordinated campaign.” </p>
<p><b>191. </b> In his post&#8209;tour report on 30 January, Maj Gen Lamb recorded:</p>
<p>“There is consistent level of attack at five/six weekly and it is anticipated that this </p>
<p>threat will grow.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>192. </b> On 8 February, Major General Andrew Figgures, the Senior British Military </p>
<p>Representative in Iraq and Deputy Commanding General Multi&#8209;National Force&#8209;Iraq, </p>
<p>reported to Gen Walker and Lt Gen Reith about an attack on one of the Snatch vehicles </p>
<p>deployed to Baghdad:</p>
<p> </p>

<p>and the fact that the C*</p>

<p>we are still some way short of providing adequate levels of protection for the </p>

<p>deploying top cover to counter direct attack on the vehicle may actually be exposing </p>
<p>our soldiers to greater danger from IEDs – a threat not seen in Northern Ireland.”</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>193. </b> Although the rate of attacks against Coalition Forces had levelled off, February </p>
<p>2004 was the worst month for casualties since the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>194. </b> From March 2004 onwards the deteriorating security situation in Iraq took a serious </p>
<p>turn for the worse. That is addressed in Section 9.2.</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Maj Gen Stewart told the Inquiry that the violence started to increase in “February/</p>
<p>March” 2004.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>196. </b> Maj Gen Stewart explained that 50 percent of his force was assisting Security </p>
<p>Sector Reform (SSR) during this time. He said that SSR continued in April (although it </p>
<p>reduced to 25 percent of his force’s time) but that “one or two of the major incidents we </p>
<p>had was people … actually moving from location to location to try and help the SSR”. </p>
<p>PROJECT DUCKBOARD EVOLVES</p>
<p><b>197. </b> On 3 February 2004, Gen Jackson wrote to Mr Hoon about the impact of </p>
<p>maintaining the current and forecast level of military commitment:</p>
<p>“… in meeting essential short term operational demands we must take care not to </p>
<p>prejudice our ability to meet longer term rebalancing goals … Measures in the EP </p>
<p>threaten our ability to meet our strategic objectives in the longer term, particularly </p>
<p>with regard to introducing a medium weight intervention capability centred on </p>
<p>FRES.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>198. </b> On 26 February, the DMB agreed a large number of service enhancements </p>
<p>and savings measures as part of a Spending Review.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> That was in response to the </p>
<p>imposition of new controls introduced by the Treasury (addressed in Section 13.1). </p>
<p><b>199. </b> The DMB considered a paper by Mr Trevor Woolley, MOD Finance Director, which </p>

<p>“the UK’s future protected mobility capability for light forces engaged on peace support </p>
<p>and other operations”. </p>
<p><b>200. </b> Mr Woolley wrote that, whilst DUCKBOARD had originally been designed to </p>
<p>replace Snatch in Northern Ireland, UK casualties on operations in Macedonia and </p>
<p>experiences from operations in Afghanistan and Iraq had “confirmed the requirement </p>
<p>for a global family of vehicles offering similar protection levels”. To supplement the </p>
<p>Snatch vehicles that had been deployed from Northern Ireland to Iraq, he recommended </p>
<p>re&#8209;profiling the funding of the programme by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>bringing forward a battlegroup worth of 80 vehicles from 2007&#8209;2012 to </p>
<p>2004&#8209;2007 (£38.5m over three years); but</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cutting the remaining PPV capability to support a medium scale PPV capability </p>
<p>of 222 vehicles that had been profiled between 2007&#8209;2014 (£76.2m over </p>
<p>seven years).</p>
<p>The overall budget was reduced by 49 percent.</p>
<p><b>201. </b> On 31 March, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) produced </p>
<p>an operational analysis for a “Rest of [the] World PPV (ROW)” which would later become </p>
<p>known as the “Vector” vehicle.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>202. </b> DSTL stated that, subsequent to an earlier operational analysis produced </p>
<p>in September 2003, Project DUCKBOARD had changed and the emphasis had </p>
<p>“shifted from a Snatch replacement in the medium term (ISD [In Service Date] 2007) </p>
<p>to providing a PPV (ROW) in the near term (ISD 2005) with an eight year in service </p>
<p>life”. That would “provide an interim capability between the Snatch OSD [Out of Service </p>
<p>Date]” and FRES.</p>
<p><b>203. </b> It was clear from the operational analysis that DSTL intended to highlight that </p>
<p>additional work needed to be done. Its stated aim was simply to summarise its progress </p>
<p>to date. Further work was needed because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Vector’s capacity, mobility and protection Key User Requirements (KURs) </p>
<p>were “still only in draft form”; they had not been articulated as part of Project </p>
<p>DUCKBOARD’s operational analysis.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “coherent statement of CONOPS, threat assessment and payload </p>
<p>requirement” that had been tasked to “the user community” in the July 2003 </p>
<p>workshop had not been developed in time for the DUCKBOARD operational </p>
<p>analysis. While further work had been done, and some assumptions about </p>
<p>Vector’s role had been made, more needed to be done to develop the user </p>
<p>requirement.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The user’s understanding of how the PPV ROW would be deployed was </p>
<p>still developing which meant that the estimated fleet numbers should be </p>
<p>re&#8209;examined.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Costs would need to be revised in accordance with all the above factors.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> The operational analysis acknowledged that PJHQ and 19 Mechanised Brigade </p>
<p>had indicated IEDs were “a considerable threat in Iraq” and stated:</p>
<p>“… Vector is likely to face a broad range of threats. These will range from stones and </p>
<p>bricks to RPG and large IEDs. Previous analysis has shown that it is not technically </p>
<p>feasible to armour a Vector equivalent to defeat […] and […] blast weapons without </p>
<p>it becoming some form of AFV. Therefore it will always be overmatched by these </p>
<p>threats. However, if these are the common threats that are to be faced in theatre </p>
<p>then a vehicle commensurate with that threat is likely to be deployed e.g. Warrior.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Based on the current CONOPS, Vector would “therefore be used in lower threat </p>
<p>environments”. </p>
<p><b>206. </b> On 14 April, Main Gate approval was sought for the development and manufacture </p>
<p>of 312 Snatch vehicles to “Snatch 2” standard, 208 of which would be for Iraq.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was to “meet immediate operational needs” and would replace the 208 Snatch 1.5 </p>
<p>variant vehicles that had previously been dispatched from Northern Ireland. There was </p>
<p>an ISD of between December 2004 and February 2005 for 80 of the vehicles. </p>
<p><b>207. </b> The total procurement cost of the 312 vehicles was £13.01m and would be </p>
<p>funded from the Project DUCKBOARD budget. The case stated that the enhancement </p>
<p>measures agreed in the 2004 Spending Review was recognition that the requirement </p>
<p>for light protected mobility was “expected to grow in future”. </p>
<p><b>208. </b> The aim of the upgrade was defined as: </p>
<p>“To provide a capability that will afford the user sufficient protection and mobility for </p>
<p>framework operations to be conducted in a semi&#8209;permissive environment, in both </p>
<p>the NI theatre and in support of expeditionary operations worldwide over FYs 04/05 </p>
<p>&amp; 05/06.” </p>
<p><b>209. </b> The business case had been produced to satisfy the immediate requirement; the </p>
<p>current Snatch fleet was over 10 years old, was in “heavy operational use” and suffered </p>
<p>from “chassis corrosion problems”. The Specialist Utility Vehicles IPT (Integrated Project </p>
<p>Team) had stated that it would “become increasingly difficult to sustain after 18 months </p>
<p>on Op TELIC without a substantial upgrade or replacement programme” and “some </p>
<p>form of project to maintain the current operational PPV capability” would be “essential </p>
<p>in FY 04/05”.</p>

<p>39</p>
<p><b>210. </b> The business case said that it was supported by current operational analysis </p>
<p>but a “fully developed justification, in the context of a balance of investment” would </p>
<p>be undertaken in support of an “overall Project DUCKBOARD” submission in </p>
<p>September 2004, where the requirement for “Snatch 2 in the worldwide role” would </p>
<p>also be established. The urgency of the current requirement meant that the balance </p>
<p>of investment analysis would not be complete before funds had to be committed. </p>
<p>Evidence would be provided in the DUCKBOARD submission to demonstrate that </p>
<p>investing in Snatch 2 “early” remained “the most cost effective solution”.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Four options were considered in the business case:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>do nothing;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>minor refresh;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>major refresh (Snatch 2) – fitting the old protected “pod” on a new base vehicle </p>
<p>with upgrades to communications and ECM; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commercial&#8209;off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf solution. </p>
<p><b>212. </b> The preferred option was the “major refresh”. That would not provide additional </p>
<p>physical protection; the relevant KUR said that Snatch 2 should have a protection level </p>
<p>that was “equivalent to current Snatch”. </p>
<p><b>213. </b> An off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf purchase was discounted on the grounds of cost and timing.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Considering publicity, the business case stated: “There will be considerable interest </p>
<p>in Snatch 2 as a result of recent deaths and injuries.” </p>
<p><b>215. </b> In response to a US request for additional UK forces during US operations in </p>
<p>Fallujah (see Section 9.2), including an armoured or mechanised battlegroup to provide </p>
<p>a theatre&#8209;wide reserve, Gen Walker agreed Lt Gen Reith’s request to return Warrior </p>
<p>vehicles to Iraq on 28 April, to provide a battlegroup reserve for MND(SE).</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>216. </b> On 11 May, Major General David Richards, Assistant Chief of the General Staff </p>
<p>(ACGS), received advice about the impact of Op TELIC’s expansion and reinforcement </p>
<p>on Headquarters Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> A request had been made for 297 Snatch vehicles: </p>
<p>77 vehicles were needed immediately, and an additional 220 over the next three to four </p>
<p>months. A request for 350 sets of ECM equipment had also been made. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> The advice highlighted concerns about the operational implications for Northern </p>
<p>Ireland of redeploying Snatch to Iraq, particularly over the marching season. At most, </p>
<p>225 vehicles could eventually be released, but that would fall short of the Op TELIC </p>
<p>requirement by 72 vehicles. It was suggested that PJHQ be directed to conduct a </p>

<p><b>218. </b> On 10 June, that concern was reiterated to Maj Gen Richards by Lieutenant </p>
<p>General Philip Trousdell, GOC Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“… it appears that what other theatres think they require is some form of protected </p>

<p>to perform an integral part in riot control … My perception is, therefore, that the </p>
<p>requests for support are not being delivered in a coherent manner and this has been </p>
<p>particularly true of Snatch, a vehicle that has rapidly become a placebo for many </p>
<p>operations.”</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Lt Gen Trousdell warned: </p>
<p>“… drip feeding the protected mobility requirement from Northern Ireland is not </p>
<p>viable in the medium to long term … Too often have we received requests for </p>
<p>specific equipment or specific personnel without a clearly defined effect.”</p>
<p><b>220. </b> Maj Gen Richards sent the minute to Lt Gen Fry, commenting:</p>
<p>“We also need to address the longer term issue as we cannot continue to solve the </p>
<p>problem on an ad hoc basis. Given our duty of care responsibilities, should we not </p>
<p>look at the issue of protected mobility again and establish a longer term policy that </p>
<p>can meet enduring commitments other than NI?”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>221. </b> On 11 June, Maj Gen Applegate upgraded the Snatch 2 business case to an </p>
<p>“Operational Emergency”.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> It would be taken forward using UOR processes to bring </p>
<p>the anticipated ISD from December 2004 to “as early as possible”. </p>

<p>for Op TELIC surge forces”. As a result, Mr Hoon and the Chiefs of Staff had “directed” </p>
<p>that these forces must be equipped to the same standard as those already in theatre. </p>
<p>The industrial timelines precluded any Snatch 2 deployment meeting the “current </p>
<p>contingency timetable” which meant that the Snatch 1.5 fleet had been increased by </p>
<p>150 vehicles.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> On 12 June, a separate USUR was raised by the Royal Engineers, for a “suitable </p>

<p>They recommended the purchase of an off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf solution – the Sisu operated by the </p>
<p>Swedish Army.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> The requirement for EOD teams was later identified as a “Type C” requirement and </p>

<p> On Project L* his visit report stated:</p>
<p>“Lord Bach understands that the delivery of vital ECM equipment procured under </p>
<p>this UOR is subject to delay. He would welcome advice on this and what is being </p>
<p>done to improve matters.” </p>
<p><b>226. </b> On 21 May, an MOD official replied that the L* capability would be fully operational </p>
<p>by January 2005 as its outstanding components would start to be delivered in July </p>
<p>2004.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> The components already delivered would meet 90 to 95 percent of the threats </p>
<p>encountered “thus far” in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>227. </b> The official wrote: “The delays in the delivery of the full L* capability are largely due </p>
<p>to the lack of clear threat and technical intelligence from the operational theatre.” </p>
<p><b>228. </b> On 28 June, the UK suffered its first fatality from a roadside IED when Fusilier </p>

<p>112</p>
<p> Two officers who were inside the vehicle survived the blast but suffered serious </p>

<p><b>229. </b> The PJHQ operational summary of the incident recorded:</p>
<p>“The sad death of a UK soldier in an IED attack today does not signal a step change </p>

<p>fatalities over the last few months.”</p>
<p>113</p>

<p><b>230. </b> The Board of Inquiry into Fusilier Gentle’s death concluded that there had been </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>231. </b> In his post&#8209;tour report on 13 July, Maj Gen Stewart wrote:</p>
<p>“The early decision to deploy Snatch and ECM has saved lives.”</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>232. </b> The first IED attack in Iraq using an Explosively Formed Projectile (EFP) took place </p>
<p>against a UK Warrior vehicle in al&#8209;Amara in May 2004.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>233. </b> On 1 July, Brigadier William Moore, Director Directorate of Equipment Capability </p>
<p>(Ground Manoeuvre) (DEC(GM)), advised PJHQ on the performance of the UK’s AFVs </p>
<p>against recent attacks.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Brig Moore wrote that initial assessments suggested that insurgent capabilities, </p>
<p>including EFPs, were capable in some circumstances of overmatching armour fitted to </p>
<p>Challenger 2 and Warrior vehicles, but they were not “at any significant risk from EFP”. </p>
<p><b>235. </b> Work to identify potential enhancements had begun, although “no platform </p>
<p>enhancement measure” in response to EFPs could be considered until an example of </p>
<p>the specific threat weapon had been examined. He also proposed a review of TTPs. </p>
<p>Brig Moore emphasised the importance of PJHQ highlighting any new anti&#8209;armour </p>
<p>weapons found in theatre and full reports of past and future incidents to inform further </p>
<p>work on armour protection. </p>
<p><b>236. </b> Brig Moore provided guidance for commanders in Iraq which stated that </p>
<p>commanders and AFV crews should “remain aware of the finite limitations of armour”. </p>
<p><b>237. </b> Lieutenant General Sir William Rollo, GOC MND(SE) from July 2004 to December </p>
<p>2004, told the Inquiry that things were “very quiet” when he took over as GOC MND(SE) </p>
<p>in July.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> He said that the Sadrist disturbances from April and May had “died away”. </p>
<p>Problems started arising again in August with the clash at Najaf which re&#8209;ignited attacks </p>
<p>on the coalition, but by December Lt Gen Rollo thought “things were relatively on track”.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether there was any difficulty “moving around” at this time, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Rollo said that there was “a sufficient number of Warrior fighting vehicles” that </p>
<p>could be used when the situation “became very unpleasant”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“Outside of that, then we were back into Snatch Land Rovers, which at that stage, </p>
<p>while … they could clearly be damaged by IEDs, they were remarkably tough </p>
<p>against the threat at that time.”</p>

<p>THE IMPACT OF THE 2004 SPENDING REVIEW ON FRES</p>
<p><b>240. </b> During September 2003, the MOD’s cash requirement for 2003/04 had risen from </p>
<p>£490m to £1,152m. That prompted Mr Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, </p>
<p>to impose controls on the MOD’s management of its resources.<b> </b>That is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 13.1. </p>
<p><b>241. </b> At the DMB on 1 October, Mr Ian Andrews, MOD Second Permanent Under </p>
<p>Secretary, explained that the MOD was now facing a near&#8209;cash shortfall of £1.1bn.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part of the MOD’s response was to identify near&#8209;cash reductions of £300m across the </p>
<p>DLO and DPA. </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Andrews had produced a paper for the Board that set out proposals for those </p>
<p>reductions, all of which were accepted. One measure was to defer £13m from the FRES </p>
<p>programme (needed to underpin its suggested procurement strategy), which could </p>
<p>“delay the programme by a few months”.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Considering the Equipment Programme on 26 February 2004, the DMB was told </p>
<p>by Sir Kevin Tebbit that Treasury controls had rendered it “unaffordable”.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> There was </p>
<p>likely to be no increase in resources and there was no scope to take risks. He said that </p>
<p>any additional enhancements “must have compensating offsets”.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> The DMB discussed Mr Woolley’s paper of proposed enhancements and savings </p>
<p>measures, including deferring the FRES ISD by a further year to December 2011.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DMB said that this was a concern and frustrating:</p>
<p>“But there was a tension between the need for a basic vehicle relatively quickly and </p>
<p>a more complex capability downstream.”</p>
<p><b>245. </b> The Assessment Phase for the procurement of FRES was announced on 5 May </p>
<p>2004.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>246. </b> On 24 June, in the context of a wider DMB discussion about the risks of meeting </p>

<p>that FRES “was in danger of falling into the trap of over&#8209;specification … despite Board </p>

<p><b>247. </b> On 25 June, Maj Gen Richards produced a paper for the Executive Committee of </p>
<p>the Army Board (ECAB) on the impact of the DMB’s decisions.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> He wrote that support </p>
<p>to current operations “remained the enduring top priority”, but between 2004 and 2008, </p>
<p>the emphasis should be on developing network&#8209;enabling activity, an initial air manoeuvre </p>
<p>capability, “and the development of medium weight forces”. </p>
<p><b>248. </b> The “most painful measure” for the Army as a result of the DMB decisions was </p>
<p>the effect on the FRES programme. Maj Gen Richards wrote that delays in agreeing </p>
<p>the procurement strategy for the programme meant that the ISD had slipped from </p>
<p>2009 to 2010. In addition, the measures agreed by DMB as part of the discussions </p>
<p>about the Equipment Programme in February, meant that the ISD could be delayed </p>
<p>further to 2012. As a result, the full operating capability for FRES was “unlikely” to be </p>
<p>fielded before 2017. That would mean running on existing armoured vehicles and could </p>
<p>lead to additional Short Term Plan or Equipment Programme costs elsewhere in the </p>
<p>programme. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Addressing future requirements, the paper stated that the Army’s highest priority </p>
<p>for the next 15 years was the development of a rapid intervention capability “with </p>
<p>capable medium forces as soon as possible”. Given the delay to FRES, “an imaginative </p>
<p>and incremental approach” would be needed. ECAB was asked to agree that the </p>
<p>priorities for a medium weight capability were: </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Between 2005 and 2009</b>: Development of an initial medium weight capability, </p>
<p>“based on in&#8209;service equipments, and those about to enter service in the period”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Between 2010 and 2014: </b>Capable medium weight forces based on the simple </p>
<p>FRES variant.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Beyond 2014: </b>Fully capable medium weight forces, including complex FRES </p>
<p>variants.</p>
<p><b>250. </b> It was also clear from the paper that the Army perceived the costs of the DMB’s </p>
<p>decision to protect large capital programmes for the Navy and Air Force, in support  </p>
<p>of an “apparent ambition to deliver a sophisticated capability in every capability area”, </p>
<p>had been found from “Land programmes”; and that could lead to further cuts in future. </p>

<p>45</p>
<p>A “TYPE B” VEHICLE</p>
<p><b>251. </b> In Maj Gen Richards’ review of the Equipment Programme for the Army on </p>
<p>25 June, he had stated that, in “the very short term”, UORs would allow “an uplift </p>
<p>in capability to meet operational requirements”.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> The UK would “be committed to </p>
<p>Op TELIC until at least the end of 2006” and “the UK’s commitment to Afghanistan could </p>
<p>increase in the same timeframe”. Operations in Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… highlighted the need for a mix of heavy ground manoeuvre capability and </p>
<p>DCC [Dismounted Close Combat], whilst the requirement for improved protected </p>
<p>mobility has been met by the deployment of Snatch from NI and Saxon. Snatch will </p>
<p>be replaced by DUCKBOARD beyond 06. The need for a coherent plan to deliver </p>
<p>protected mobility vehicles to meet the requirement of both theatres of operation </p>
<p>has been highlighted.” </p>
<p><b>252. </b> On 7 July, DEC(SP) set out the next steps on Project DUCKBOARD so a business </p>
<p>case could be developed and approved by September.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> The minute stated that the role </p>
<p>for light protected mobility in Northern Ireland remained enduring, and it reiterated how </p>
<p>operational experience overseas had highlighted capability gaps in post&#8209;conflict, peace </p>
<p>support operations and counter&#8209;terrorist situations.</p>
<p><b>253. </b> DEC(SP) stated that the way forward was “beset with unresolved issues”, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a range of threats across new operating environments, such as Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan with “ill&#8209;defined” requirements;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no clearly defined” user focus or capability management mechanisms;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an “incomplete definition” of the number of vehicles required; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no defined logistic vision or relationship with other mobility capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>254. </b> DEC(SP) repeated the concerns raised in the 14 April business case about the </p>
<p>aged Snatch fleet and chassis corrosion. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> The number of required vehicles remained “undefined” but DEC(SP) stated that </p>
<p>an initial analysis “might be” for three different types of PPV:</p>

<p><b>Type</b></p>
<p><b>Features</b></p>
<p><b>Estimated number </b></p>
<p><b>required</b></p>
<p>A</p>
<p>Essentially a Snatch replacement with the </p>
<p>same levels of ballistic protection for low level </p>
<p>counter&#8209;terror and public order operations, mainly </p>
<p>for use in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>612</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>(the Expeditionary </p>
<p>or “Rest of World” </p>
<p>vehicle)</p>
<p>For expeditionary use in “high threat CT </p>
<p>operations”. The minimum ballistic protection </p>
<p>level required was considered to be B6 (as was </p>
<p>currently provided by Tavern). </p>
<p>144</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>A specialised EOD vehicle; again requiring B6 </p>
<p>ballistic protection for use on expeditionary </p>
<p>operations. </p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>256. </b> On protection levels, the DEC(SP) said that “the terrorist will invariably overmatch </p>
<p>the target” given that Iraqi and other Middle Eastern terrorists had been “able to destroy </p>
<p>tanks in IED attacks”: </p>
<p>“Protection levels therefore should be optimised for blast, fragments, the ‘near&#8209;miss’ </p>
<p>etc rather than to defeat direct attack. Protection for a PPV is more a function of </p>
<p>Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) (examples include top&#8209;cover sentries, </p>
<p>combined foot and mounted patrols, multiple vehicle patrols, helicopter top&#8209;cover </p>
<p>etc) than thickness of armour.” </p>
<p><b>257. </b> The purchase of new vehicles to meet the Type A requirement had an estimated </p>
<p>total programme cost of £62.5m. As only £55.31m of funding was available, an upgrade </p>
<p>to Snatch 2, at an estimated total cost of £53.8m, was recommended.</p>
<p><b>258. </b> DEC(SP) intended to take a “twin&#8209;track” approach to procurement:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A programme to upgrade existing Snatch vehicles to Snatch 2 would begin </p>
<p>almost immediately to meet the Type A requirement, with 100 Snatch 2 being </p>
<p>available by 31 December 2004 and a further 200 by 30 June 2005.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An initial assessment for the remainder of the Type A requirement and the Types </p>
<p>B and C requirement would be undertaken. Delivery of the Type B requirement </p>
<p>was expected in Financial Year (FY) 2006/07 and Type C was expected in </p>
<p>FY 2007/08.</p>
<p><b>259. </b> The letter identified the savings measure imposed from the 2004 Spending Review, </p>
<p>to reduce the expeditionary capability from medium to small scale in the longer term, </p>
<p>as “programme blight”. It stated that that, and “the lack of an endorsed requirement for </p>
<p>both numbers and capability”, meant that a business case for the whole light protected </p>
<p>mobility requirement would not be available before September 2004. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>260. </b> DEC(SP) also wrote that the actual requirement for Type B vehicles was 396 but </p>
<p>the savings measure agreed in February 2004 had rendered that unrealistic. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> The minute concluded, however, by stating that the enhancement measure agreed </p>
<p>in the same review, to bring forward the funding for 80 vehicles to 2004/05, had enabled </p>
<p>the search for a solution:</p>
<p>“To date light protected mobility in an expeditionary role has been something of an </p>
<p>orphan capability, managed on an ad hoc basis from a base capability centred on </p>
<p>the NI role. Operational imperatives and the bring&#8209;forward of funding now offer the </p>
<p>opportunity to develop the capability in support of global expeditionary operations, </p>
<p>delivering a coherent and integrated concept, whilst at the same time continuing to </p>
<p>meet long&#8209;term NI commitments.”</p>
<p><b>262. </b> An acquisition strategy for the Type B (expeditionary) PPV capability was produced </p>
<p>by the Specialist Utility Vehicle IPT on 19 July.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> It stated that operational analysis </p>
<p>studies had “discounted the use of Snatch 2 as a coherent option for meeting this </p>
<p>capability”. It considered three options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to do nothing;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf or a modified commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf procurement; </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>design development – creating a “bespoke” solution.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> The option to do nothing was not recommended because the “use of in&#8209;service </p>
<p>assets that fail to meet the minimum stated performance levels would put users at risk </p>
<p>and potentially create an operational vacuum at the source of provision”. The time and </p>
<p>cost implications of the design development option meant that that was also ruled out.</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Considering the commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf procurement, the IPT wrote that there </p>
<p>were “a number of products on the market from specialist military vehicle suppliers </p>
<p>that could provide a near match to the identified KURs and derived KSRs [Key Service </p>
<p>Requirements]”. The difficulty was that there would “inevitably” be areas that would not </p>
<p>be “optimised for British Army use”, such as communications equipment.</p>
<p><b>265. </b> A modified commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf procurement was therefore the recommended </p>
<p>option as that would allow the MOD to engage suppliers over the British Army’s specific </p>
<p>requirements.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> The procurement strategy was to be developed and reviewed leading up to the </p>
<p>submission of a business case. No timescale or deadline was specified.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Major General Peter Gilchrist, Master General of the Ordnance, produced a paper </p>

<p>new lessons from Operation TELIC were “the need to give greater thought to future </p>
<p>ECM, protected mobility and [Type] B vehicle desertisation requirements”. </p>
<p><b>268. </b> The requirement for PPVs on operations continued to grow. Immediate needs </p>
<p>were being met by the redeployment of vehicles from Northern Ireland and desertisation </p>
<p>would be complete by the end of May 2004,</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> “despite delays in receiving clear </p>
<p>requirements and UOR funding”. There was concern “over the longer&#8209;term sustainability” </p>
<p>of Snatch’s “aged, petrol&#8209;engined chassis” but the funding brought forward from EP04 </p>
<p>would “help address this issue”. </p>
<p><b>269. </b> Maj Gen Gilchrist wrote that the DEC(SP) minute of 7 July had provided </p>
<p>“a sensible framework … to commence project activity” using the twin&#8209;track approach: </p>
<p>“ … in the short term (1&#8209;2 yrs), a life extension for Snatch, and in the medium term  </p>
<p>a new COTS [commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf] PPV, a little larger than Snatch”. The life </p>
<p>extension programme, “known as Snatch 2”, was already under way. The business case </p>
<p>had been approved and trial vehicles had been delivered in June.</p>
<p><b>270. </b> On FRES, Maj Gen Gilchrist wrote that, following the announcement of the its </p>
<p>Assessment Phase on 5 May 2004, it was envisaged that a contract would be let in </p>
<p>late 2004, leading to Main Gate approval “for the system and simpler FRES variants” </p>

<p><b>271. </b> At ECAB on 20 July, although “disappointment” was expressed at the pace with </p>

<p>a significant force protection issue.”</p>

<p>137</p>
<p> It stated that Iran was “establishing agent networks, providing funding </p>
<p>and material to a number of Shia groups and generally seeking to gain influence” and </p>
<p>judged that “Iranian encouragement, funding and possibly arms” were “being provided </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>security situation was “now far more difficult than hitherto”. It was “complex and </p>
<p>multi&#8209;layered” and, with the intimidation and killing of key people, it was having an </p>
<p>effect on governance and recovery. </p>
<p><b>283. </b> On 3 September, a CIG Assessment reported: </p>
<p>“The recent fighting has shown that the Mahdi Army is developing into an </p>
<p>increasingly resolute organisation, capable of launching sophisticated attacks … </p>
<p>They have been able to mount determined and sophisticated attacks using small </p>
<p>arms, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and heavier weapons such as mortars </p>
<p>and RPGs … Al&#8209;Sadr retains the ability to mobilise a significant body of poor, </p>
<p>unemployed Shia youth.”</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>284. </b> The Assessment also stated that “some recovered anti&#8209;armour weapons may have </p>
<p>been procured through Lebanese Hizballah with Iranian knowledge”.</p>
<p><b>285. </b> On 26 September, a report from Mr Robert Davies, Chief Police Adviser to the </p>
<p>Iraq Ministry of Interior, stated that the FCO’s Overseas Security Adviser had directed </p>
<p>UK police staff not to travel in Snatch Land Rovers because of inadequate armour.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Davies wrote:</p>
<p>“This direction places a significant limitation on the deployment of our staff … </p>
<p>The appropriate protection could be provided by a team from the Control Risk </p>

<p><b>288. </b> On 1 October, the DIS produced two reports that were circulated within the MOD </p>
<p>and to the intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> One looked at the Command Wire IED (CWIED) </p>
<p>threat and the other at the Radio&#8209;Controlled IED (RCIED) threat. </p>
<p><b>289. </b> The CWIED report assessed that CWIED attacks were relatively uncommon but </p>
<p>were growing in number and sophistication; that was assessed as a “concerted attempt” </p>
<p>to counter ECM. The DIS advised that improvements to ECM were “likely to lead to </p>
<p>increased use of CWIED, RCIED and other forms of non&#8209;Radio&#8209;Controlled command </p>
<p>initiated IEDs”.</p>
<p><b>290. </b> The RCIED report stated that RCIED attacks represented around 75 percent of all </p>
<p>IEDs and that IEDs in turn accounted for 75 percent of casualties. The DIS assessed </p>
<p>that in the next 12 months:</p>
<p>“IED technology in use with other Middle Eastern groups especially Lebanese </p>
<p>Hizballah, can be expected to appear in Iraq. This would include multiple systems, </p>
<p>such as RC (Radio&#8209;Controlled) switched PIRs [Passive Infra Red].” </p>
<p><b>291. </b> Also on 1 October, Gen Walker received an update from AM Torpy on the provision </p>
<p>of ECM to UK forces:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number, complexity and sophistication of RCIEDs used against coalition </p>
<p>forces was increasing. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The L* programme was experiencing some manufacturing delays.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was insufficient ECM equipment in MND(SE) to provide protection for all </p>
<p>troops and therefore prioritisation had been necessary.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ECM did not offer 100 percent protection and was used in conjunction with TTPs </p>
<p>and other force protection measures.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>292. </b> AM Torpy informed Gen Walker that the value of the L* programme had risen to </p>
<p>over £100m since its approval in late 2003. </p>
<p><b>293. </b> In his post&#8209;tour report, Maj Gen Rollo commented:</p>
<p>“The current ECM suite is adapting to meet the threat, providing UK soldiers the best </p>
<p>protection amongst the coalition forces, but procurement and production struggle to </p>
<p>meet the demands in theatre. We are well below the scales needed for appropriate </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>A PPV FOR AFGHANISTAN</p>
<p><b>294. </b> In June 2004, a decision was taken that the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps HQ </p>
<p>(ARRC), a UK&#8209;led NATO asset, should deploy to Afghanistan in 2006, rather than </p>
<p>Iraq (see Section 9.2). By October, that decision had become an important factor </p>
<p>in considering resources for Iraq.</p>
<p><b>295. </b> On 15 October, the strategy for delivering Project DUCKBOARD was produced.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>296. </b> A total of 371 “desertised” Snatch 1.5 vehicles had been delivered to support </p>
<p>operations in Iraq: 308 were in operation and 63 were held in reserve. An additional </p>
<p>70 Snatch 2 vehicles would be available from December 2004, also for the reserve, </p>
<p>to replace the 1.5 variants as their capability deteriorated. More than 20 vehicles on </p>
<p>Op TELIC had already been damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p><b>297. </b> The strategy identified that a requirement for protected mobility still had to be </p>
<p>defined and that there were a number of “challenges”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If Defence has to support; current NI commitments; a continuance of Op TELIC </p>
<p>on current scales; and a medium scale operation in Afghanistan simultaneously </p>
<p>in 2006, a new acquisition of Protected Mobility vehicles, currently unfunded … </p>
<p>will be necessary.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Production would need to start in April 2005 to meet the “ready to train date” for </p>
<p>deployment to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regardless of concurrent operations in 2006, “urgent EP/UOR action” was </p>
<p>needed to meet “USURs arising from Operation TELIC and to sustain the </p>
<p>Snatch fleet”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no overarching doctrine, no endorsed CONOPS nor definitive </p>
<p>scaling for the provision of Protected Mobility for expeditionary operations”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “lack of definition of the numbers and types of vehicles required” continued </p>
<p>to “stall the acquisition process”.</p>
<p><b>298. </b> The strategy recommended requirements should be taken forward as three </p>
<p>separate projects, “within an overarching scrutiny mechanism”, so that each strand could </p>
<p>be delivered independently and at its own pace:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Type A project (“Snatch 2”) – continuing the conversion of existing Snatch </p>
<p>vehicles for operations in UK and Iraq (the first tranche already under way as an </p>
<p>Operational Emergency); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Type B project (“Vector”) – producing this capability would depend on </p>
<p>Afghanistan and Iraq concurrency assumptions “and or direction as to required </p>
<p>protection levels”; and</p>
<p>149 </p>
<p>Minute MOD [junior officer] to D Jt Cap (AD Jt Mvre), 15 October 2004, ‘Strategy for Delivery of </p>
<p>Protected Patrol and Combat Support Mobility – Project DUCKBOARD’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Type C project (“Format”) – producing capability for combat support units in </p>
<p>expeditionary operations, including replacing eight Zimmer</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> vehicles sent to </p>
<p>Iraq for IED Disposal teams in April 2003, which were “failing” and the USUR </p>
<p>raised by the Royal Engineers on 12 June for “some form of protected mobility”. </p>
<p><b>299. </b> The strategy stated that an analysis of the numbers had “proved extremely difficult” </p>
<p>without any endorsed CONOPS and “no overall front line Customer 2 lead”. The 308 </p>
<p>Snatch 1.5 vehicles in Iraq, and 133 in reserve, were listed as a “firm requirement”.</p>
<p><b>300. </b> The “emerging requirements” included a minimum of 224 Type B Vector vehicles </p>
<p>for Afghanistan in 2006. Considering its options, the strategy stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were not concurrent, the present vehicle </p>
<p>scaling would suffice, Vector would not be procured, and any enhancements to </p>
<p>the 2005 Equipment Programme would be withdrawn. Priority would switch to </p>
<p>sustaining the conversion of Snatch 1.5 vehicles to the Snatch 2 variant. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the operations were concurrent, the requirement for 224 vehicles for </p>
<p>Afghanistan could be met by removing the 133 Snatch vehicles held in reserve </p>
<p>for Iraq and reducing Northern Ireland’s allocation by 100. “Alternatively, </p>
<p>TELIC could reduce to 100 vehicles, freeing the balance of 271”, subject to </p>
<p>refurbishment, available for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the operations were concurrent, an additional capability could be procured. </p>
<p>That was the recommended option.</p>
<p><b>301. </b> The “realistic assessment” was that definitive requirements and numbers were </p>
<p>not likely to be possible before December 2004 and the balance between Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan was “unlikely to be clear before mid 05”. The strategy proposed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Snatch 2 production be extended by a further Operational Emergency business </p>
<p>case for the conversion of another 360 Snatch 1 vehicles to guarantee the </p>
<p>model’s sustainability for 2006;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the first tranche of 141 Vector vehicles be procured by UOR against Equipment </p>
<p>Programme funding to ensure an interim operating capability by 31 January </p>
<p>2006; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the first two of four tranches be procured for 24 combat support vehicles by UOR </p>
<p>against Equipment Programme funding.</p>
<p><b>302. </b> On 27 October, Commodore Peter Eberle, Director Directorate of Joint </p>
<p>Capability, raised an SOR for all three Types of PPV with DEC(SP) and Brigadier Tim </p>
<p>Inshaw, Director of Capability Integration (Army) (DCI(A)).</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> Cdre Eberle said that </p>
<p>it was “needed as a matter of priority” to inform consideration of options in the 2005 </p>

<p>Equipment Programme and because of the finite number of Snatch vehicles and the </p>
<p>lead times needed by industry to produce additional vehicles in time for a deployment to </p>
<p>Afghanistan in 2006. </p>
<p><b>303. </b> Cdre Eberle stated that there was a potential increase in operational activity over </p>
<p>the period 2005&#8209;2007 and, in particular in 2006, which correlated with priorities already </p>
<p>identified: the importance of light forces in combating international terrorism and the key </p>
<p>capability of force protection from asymmetric threats. The “requirement for protected </p>
<p>mobility and force protection measures” was “unlikely to diminish”. PPVs had continued </p>
<p>to prove their worth, “albeit within strict limitations of physical protection”. </p>
<p><b>304. </b> Looking at the three variants of PPV required, the paper stated that the User </p>
<p>Requirement Document (URD)</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> for the Type A (public order) variant remained “extant”. </p>
<p>The URD for the Type B (expeditionary) variant was “similar to the Type A” but also </p>
<p>needed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>better physical protection,</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> including protection against fragmentation and </p>
<p>blast, which was “essential”, and some degree of protection against mines which </p>
<p>was “highly desirable”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ability to be fitted with the most appropriate ECM suite to counter the </p>
<p>prevailing threat in a given theatre. </p>
<p><b>305. </b> In relation to deployment in Iraq, the paper stated that the employment of PPV </p>
<p>Snatch was “threat driven”, which:</p>
<p>“… meant that all tasks being conducted in or through specific areas have required </p>
<p>the use of PPV Snatch, with these tasks ranging from framework patrolling to the </p>
<p>escorting of white fleet vehicles that are unable to provide their own top cover </p>
<p>protection.”</p>
<p><b>306. </b> The paper’s recommendations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A minimum requirement of 1,236 vehicles to cover both Type A and Type B  </p>
<p>PPV variants should be made available to support all UK operations worldwide </p>
<p>during 2006.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A minimum requirement of 1,228 ECM suites which “should be able to counter </p>
<p>the prevailing threat where PPV are deployed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The figures were the minimum and not the totality of the requirement, </p>
<p>constituting 72 percent of the potential peak requirement.</p>
<p>152 </p>
<p>A specification about what the equipment is expected to do and what features or capabilities it needs to </p>
<p>fulfil its role.</p>
<p>153 </p>
<p>The precise level of physical protection specified remains classified.</p>
<p>154 </p>
<p>The detail about how this figure was broken down according to each operation was provided in an </p>
<p>attached annex but the MOD has been unable to provide the Inquiry with a legible copy and unfortunately </p>
<p>the defined PPV requirement for Iraq and Afghanistan cannot be seen.</p>

<p>Brig Inshaw would act as Customer Two “Core Leader” with “the role of </p>
<p>overseeing the lines of development” in consultation with Cdre Eberle, who </p>
<p>would act as the joint Customer Two.</p>
<p><b>307. </b> Cdre Eberle stated that the number of PPVs required had been “derived from </p>
<p>consultation with FLCs, PJHQ and within MOD Centre” but there were a number of </p>
<p>“unknowns” that constrained the ability to “achieve a high degree of accuracy” in the </p>
<p>figures. Those included the timeline for the drawdown in Iraq and, for Afghanistan, </p>
<p>the nature of the threat, the UK CONOPS, and the scale and timing of the UK’s </p>
<p>medium&#8209;term engagement.</p>
<p><b>308. </b> The paper stated that there were “no alternatives to PPV for the protected </p>
<p>mobility capability requirement within the timeframe under consideration”. It described </p>
<p>tracked light armoured vehicles as “inappropriate due to their posture and the extended </p>
<p>distances that are regularly travelled while on patrol or escort tasks”.</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Civilian movements in Iraq were being constrained by the IED threat as even the </p>

<p>156</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“You [sic] comment that rigid security rules prevents senior police officers from being </p>
<p>allowed to move freely on the ground is understood. The underlying issue is that </p>
<p>FCO duty of care for all HMG staff currently dictates that military vehicles do not </p>
<p>meet the minimum level of protection required.”</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Mr Hayward wrote that they were discussing with the Security Strategy Unit </p>
<p>whether there was any “room for flexibility in application of current policy”. He added: </p>
<p>“However, as you know the duty of care does weigh heavily in terms of the safety of </p>

<p><b>315. </b> On 2 December, the DIS produced a report on the evolution of the IED threat </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) remain the main killer of coalition forces </p>
<p>(CF). The threat from IEDs continues to evolve not only quantitatively, but also </p>
<p>qualitatively, with new or modified device types and Modus Operandi (MO).</p>
<p>“The rise in IED attacks in 2004 indicates that, despite CF tactical successes, </p>
<p>the security situation has not improved overall and individual terror groups are </p>
<p>making significant progress in terms of ability to mount successful IED attacks, </p>
<p>probably through improved C2 [command and control], logistics, recruiting and </p>
<p>external assistance.</p>
<p>“Improvement in IED technology has been most significant in Shia areas since May </p>
<p>04, where insurgents have technical progress that we assess could only have been </p>
<p>achieved through focused external assistance. We assess that this may be due to </p>
<p>an influx of Lebanese Hizballah IED technology under Iranian sponsorship …” </p>
<p><b>316. </b> The DIS stated that the increased use of CWIEDs in MND(SE) indicated an </p>
<p>awareness of UK ECM and assessed that the threat was likely “to continue to develop </p>
<p>to resemble that of other Middle East countries, such as Israel, with the further import </p>
<p>of IED technology and MO from Palestinian, Lebanese and AQ [Al Qaida] associated </p>
<p>groups”. It highlighted that IEDs accounted for 40&#8209;45 percent of MNF fatalities and over </p>
<p>70 percent of all injuries.</p>
<p><b>317. </b> On 19 January 2005, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Paul Boateng, Chief Secretary to </p>

<p><b>320. </b> Mr Woolley outlined that the strategy for Short Term Plan and 2005 Equipment </p>
<p>Programme was to implement decisions already taken by the DMB and Ministers, </p>
<p>“rather than making significant adjustments to force structure or capability”. </p>
<p><b>321. </b> Mr Woolley wrote that “some £82m” had been earmarked to fund the continuing </p>
<p>support costs of recently procured UOR equipments. Recognising constraints on </p>
<p>accessing the Reserve, £30m had been set aside across 2005/06 and 2006/07 to </p>

<p>“… balancing and de&#8209;risking the programme had required a number of painful </p>
<p>measures, especially in the early years. But it was now a robust programme that </p>
<p>could be taken forward effectively.”</p>
<p><b>326. </b> In agreeing the programme to be submitted to Mr Hoon, the DMB approved lists </p>
<p>of proposed savings and enhancements in the Equipment Programme, “reflecting the </p>
<p>pressures and changing circumstances since the 2004 Spending Review settlement”. </p>
<p><b>327. </b> A report on lessons from Op TELIC produced by the MOD’s Directorate of </p>
<p>Operational Capability (DOC) on 22 February stated:</p>
<p>“With the continued increase in the use of IEDs, the Snatch conversion programme </p>
<p>was a belated reaction to the threat … Trends indicate that future operations </p>
<p>will continue to face threats of a similar nature and Defence planning should be </p>
<p>cognisant of this reality, rather than reactive to a situation after a deployment is </p>
<p>under way.”</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>328. </b> The report highlighted two lessons on protected mobility:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Sustained investment is required to provide sufficient protected mobility </p>
<p>vehicles for operations in hostile environments such as Iraq …”</p>

<p><b>332. </b> The minutes recorded that the £42m was insufficient to deliver the total fleet </p>
<p>requirement of 1,228 needed to support the deployment of PPVs worldwide.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 1,228 figure would have supported the deployment of 982 Snatch 2 and 246 Vector. </p>
<p>There was now only available funding for one of the following options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>512 vehicles (312 Snatch 2 and 200 Vector);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>724 vehicles (624 Snatch 2 and 100 Vector); or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>936 vehicles (936 Snatch 2 and no Vector).</p>
<p><b>333. </b> It was agreed that the Directorate of Joint Capability would confirm which option </p>
<p>should be pursued by 18 February.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> The Specialist Utility Vehicle IPT stated that in order to deliver 100 Vector </p>
<p>vehicles by June 2006, the solution would need to be a commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf option </p>
<p>and the business case needed to be submitted by July 2005, with the contract let by </p>
<p>October 2005.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> The group agreed Key User Requirements for the Vector vehicle and, the </p>
<p>Specialist Utility Vehicle IPT was tasked to identify all of the options that could meet </p>
<p>them. Those would be discussed at the next CIWG on 23 February.</p>
<p><b>336. </b> On 21 February, a revised PPV SOR was produced in light of the funding </p>
<p>levels agreed by the DMB, which was referred to in the SOR as a “45% cut” (see the </p>
<p>consideration of that figure in the Box, ‘Was there a 45% cut?’).</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>337. </b> The SOR elaborated on the three options provided by the PPV Working Group: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Option 1: Convert the remainder of Snatch to Snatch 2 – giving a total of 936 </p>
<p>vehicles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Option 2: Convert 312 Snatch to Snatch 2 (in addition to the 312 already </p>
<p>undergoing conversion for Iraq) and procure approximately 100 Vector giving </p>
<p>a total of 624 Snatch 2 and 100 Vector – an overall total of 724 vehicles; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Option 3: Procure 200 Vector – giving a total of 312 Snatch 2 and 200 Vector.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Option 2 was identified as the preferred option, with Vector vehicles to be delivered </p>
<p>by 1 June 2006.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> The paper stated that further examination of the funding was necessary to enable </p>
<p>a “sensible transition of the PPV fleet from its current to its future configuration” after the </p>
<p>Vector vehicles were delivered. Force Level Reviews “must re&#8209;examine the current PPV </p>
<p>requirements for all theatres” once the actual fleet size was known. The exact number of </p>
<p>166 </p>
<p>The minutes do not record the budget to which this figure refers but the Inquiry infers that it was to </p>
<p>cover the 1,236 Type A and Type B vehicles proposed in the SOR on 27 October. See the Box, ‘Was there </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>PPVs that could be converted to Snatch 2, and the exact number of Vector vehicles that </p>
<p>it would be possible to procure, was not yet known.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> In considering protection levels, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“The increasing levels of violence during Phase IV of Op TELIC, which necessitated </p>
<p>the widespread use of protected mobility, have been highlighted in recent reports.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally OA [operational analysis] is consistently reporting on the increased </p>
<p>effectiveness of small arms weapons and ammunition. Therefore the PPV CIWG has </p>
<p>deemed that the combination of ECM and an enhanced level of protection […] are </p>
<p>to be the minimum standard for TYPE B Vector Variant. For Type A, a […] protection </p>
<p>level, in conjunction with ECM, is deemed sufficient given the nature of the threat it </p>
<p>is likely to be exposed to …”</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Highlighting current concerns, including the DOC Op TELIC Lessons study, the </p>
<p>paper stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“As experience from the last 18 months has shown, having insufficient PPV to </p>
<p>meet the operational demands … has resulted not only in sub&#8209;optimal solutions </p>
<p>through reallocation between theatres (and a commensurate increase in </p>
<p>operational risk for all concerned), but also adverse media attention …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There are public, political and media expectations that military operations can </p>
<p>now be conducted without significant casualties. Indeed, lessons learnt from </p>
<p>operations and policy guidance are demanding sustained investment to provide </p>
<p>sufficient protected mobility vehicles for operations in hostile environments, such </p>
<p>as Iraq and Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>342. </b> The paper ended:</p>
<p>“Despite the significant resource constraint that has been placed on this aspect of </p>
<p>the Force Protection capability as a result of EP/STP05, the operational requirement </p>
<p>for Op HERRICK [Afghanistan], which has been the principal driver behind this PPV </p>
<p>work, demands a more capable vehicle than PPV Snatch 2. Indeed, the need for </p>
<p>PPV is unlikely to diminish for the foreseeable future.” </p>
<p><b>Was there a 45 percent cut?</b></p>
<p>The Statement of Requirement (SOR) produced by the MOD on 21 February 2005 stated </p>
<p>that it reflected revised funding levels for PPVs as agreed by the DMB as part of the 2005 </p>
<p>Equipment Programme. The MOD claimed that was a 45 percent cut in funding.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has been unable to find any evidence that that was the case. </p>

<p>It has considered the papers that went to the DMB meeting on 26 January 2005 and the </p>
<p>minutes of that meeting. The only difference that appears to arise is that the DMB agreed </p>
<p>to fund 650 vehicles as opposed to 724 but the minutes and papers do not provide any </p>
<p>consideration of how the number of vehicles was decided.</p>
<p>The MOD told the Inquiry it was: </p>
<p>“ … unable to find any evidence of a specific reduction in the funding of PPVs by </p>
<p>45%. It is unclear how that figure was determined.”</p>

<p>170</p>
<p> Option 2 </p>
<p>had been finalised but the Chair highlighted the need to “give SUV IPT direction with </p>
<p>confirming URs and KURs”. </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Concerns “were aired as to the future of the remaining Snatch” vehicles that had </p>
<p>not been funded for an upgrade. The Directorate of Joint Capability agreed to investigate </p>
<p>whether they could be funded “from the Afghanistan Contingency Funds through PJHQ”.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> The business case for the conversion of the second batch of 312 Snatch vehicles </p>
<p>was submitted on 16 June 2005 and was approved in early July 2005. That is addressed </p>
<p>later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>Response to the increase in the threat</b></p>
<p><b>346. </b> In Iraq the IED threat was continuing to evolve, prompting a review of tactics and </p>
<p>protection.</p>
<p><b>347. </b> On 28 April, DSTL produced a presentation entitled ‘Performance of Explosively </p>
<p>Formed Projectiles Against UK Armour’ outlining the results of further testing of IEDs </p>
<p>against Warrior&#8209;type armour.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> That stated: </p>
<p>“Initial investigations concluded that these devices […] posed a significantly </p>
<p>enhanced threat when compared to previously exploited weapons.” </p>
<p><b>348. </b> DSTL recommended the inclusion of an additional layer of protective armour on </p>
<p>Warrior to help to mitigate the new threat.</p>

<p><b>350. </b> The first attack where an EFP was detonated using Passive Infra Red (PIR) </p>
<p>technology took place in MND(SE) on 29 May, when Lance Corporal Alan Brackenbury </p>
<p>was killed while travelling in a Land Rover south of al&#8209;Amara.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>351. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 1 June, Gen Walker directed Major General </p>
<p>Peter Wall, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations (Operations), to conduct an analysis of the </p>
<p>incident and inform the Chiefs of Staff of the lessons identified, particularly with regard </p>
<p>to countermeasures, and “to take a view on the current operating procedures and the </p>
<p>relative merits of protected/unprotected vehicles”.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>352. </b> Maj Gen Wall submitted his analysis to the Chiefs of Staff on 6 June.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> He wrote </p>
<p>that the attacked vehicle was leading a three vehicle patrol of unprotected Wolf Land </p>
<p>Rovers. It was assessed that a Snatch Land Rover would not have offered greater </p>
<p>protection or prevented LCpl Brackenbury’s injuries. </p>
<p><b>353. </b> Addressing the use of Snatch, Maj Gen Wall wrote:</p>
<p>“Operating procedures are based on the threat, the task, the terrain and force profile. </p>
<p>Threat and mobility are the key factors in assessing the relative merits of deploying </p>
<p>Snatch or TUM [Wolf Land Rover]. Whilst there is no formal limitation on the use of </p>
<p>Snatch … TUM is usually preferred for cross country use in rural areas … and this </p>
<p>is the standard operating procedure. There is insufficient Snatch in theatre for its </p>
<p>general use outside the urban areas …”</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Maj Gen Wall added that Maj Gen Riley had “adopted a more protective posture” </p>
<p>following the recent IED attacks and that “all road movement within the province” was </p>
<p>being conducted in Snatch or armoured vehicles – Warrior and CVR(T). </p>
<p><b>355. </b> In his final report as GOC MND(SE), Maj Gen Riley wrote that his “overriding </p>
<p>concern” was the “continuing IED attacks in Maysan”, where:</p>
<p>“… patrols now use Warriors to over&#8209;watch the armoured Land Rovers in order </p>
<p>to give additional protection. This takes careful explaining to the local population </p>
<p>who remember the use of Warriors to defeat last summer’s JAM [Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi] </p>
<p>offensive.”</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>356. </b> Some of the key lessons Maj Gen Riley identified in a separate report on 10 June </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“More training on Snatch and other UOR requirements, and the development of </p>
<p>basic infantry skills, must be factored into any pre&#8209;deployment training.”</p>

<p><b>360. </b> Lieutenant General Robert Fulton, DCDS(EC), provided that paper on 20 June.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>He advised that the UK’s current capability was “largely ineffective” in MND(SE). A new </p>
<p>detector, due to enter service in December, was more effective, but “not suitable for </p>
<p>the protection of mobile patrols”. An airborne detection capability had been deployed to </p>
<p>MND(SE) but that also had its limitations. </p>
<p><b>361. </b> Lt Gen Fulton asked the Chiefs of Staff to note those points but no solution or </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>365. </b> The ISD for 80 vehicles was November 2005 and the development of an </p>
<p>up&#8209;armoured appliqué kit that could provide protection levels of up […] for Snatch 2 was </p>
<p>to be complete by September 2005.</p>
<p><b>366. </b> The business case stated that the operational analysis on Snatch had been </p>
<p>conducted by DSTL and that the cheapest options to meet the Snatch 2 and Vector </p>
<p>protection requirements were to upgrade remaining Snatch 1 vehicles to Snatch 2 or </p>
<p>a potentially new Snatch 3 variant. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> While no work had been done to understand the proportion of the fleet that </p>
<p>required higher levels of protection, a “sensitivity analysis” had confirmed that evolving </p>
<p>the Snatch model was the most cost&#8209;effective method of achieving better protection. </p>
<p>Further work would be done to understand the number of upgrades needed and would </p>
<p>be reported when the Vector business case was submitted.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> The business case to convert the remaining 312 Snatch 1/1.5 vehicles to Snatch 2 </p>
<p>standard was approved by the Investment Approvals Board (IAB) on 7 July.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>369. </b> The IAB’s approval note said that, in early 2004, Mr Nick Bennett, Director </p>
<p>General (Scrutiny &amp; Analysis) (DG(S&amp;A)), met a DEC(SP) official and agreed a strategy </p>
<p>for “establishing the balance between Snatch 2 and Vector numbers around which a </p>
<p>procurement route was to be determined”. The note said that that work had not been </p>
<p>done, “presumably due to the Operational Emergency approach” taken to the 14 April </p>
<p>2004 submission, “which indicated that the balance of investment operational analysis </p>
<p>work would be completed to inform the follow&#8209;on submission. This was also not done”. </p>
<p><b>370. </b> The note stated that Mr Nick Barnett, DG(S&amp;A) between July 2005 and September </p>
<p>2005, wanted reassurance that, in parallel with any other procurement action for the </p>
<p>second batch of conversions to Snatch 2, the balance of investment work on Vector and </p>
<p>Snatch 2 numbers would “be taken forward before long”. </p>
<p><b>371. </b> The work that concentrated on the Type B PPV capability necessary to procure the </p>
<p>Vector vehicle became known as Project Vector. </p>
<p><b>372. </b> The business case for the first tranche of vehicles was submitted on 3 March 2006 </p>
<p>and is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Lord Drayson, who had become Parliamentary Under&#8209;Secretary of State and </p>
<p>Minister for Defence Procurement in May 2005, visited Iraq from 6 to 8 July.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>374. </b> The report of his visit stated that feedback on equipment was generally positive </p>
<p>but “a number of issues” were raised when he spoke to troops from 12 Mechanised </p>
<p>Brigade. Those included the long wait for Warrior upgrades and that “the protection of </p>

<p>RAF Regiment Land Rovers was not thought to be sufficient by the troops for the tasks </p>
<p>that they were expected to carry out in the vehicles”.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> On 16 July, Second Lieutenant Richard Shearer, Private Phillip Hewett and Private </p>
<p>Leon Spicer were killed in an EFP IED attack in al&#8209;Amara.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> They were travelling in </p>
<p>a Snatch Land Rover. </p>
<p><b>376. </b> After 16 July until late August, the Chiefs of Staff reviewed progress on </p>
<p>countermeasures against the threat from IEDs using PIR devices and EFPs at every </p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>377. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 20 July, AM Torpy briefed that there had been a </p>
<p>13 per cent increase in the overall number of attacks in Iraq, with a 65 percent increase </p>
<p>in casualties as the lethality of attacks also rose.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>378. </b> The minutes stated:</p>
<p>“With the exception of Maysan, MND(SE) had remained comparatively quiet; the </p>
<p>fatal attack of a vehicle patrol on 16 Jul 05 had nevertheless resulted in a review </p>
<p>of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, including increased ISR [Intelligence, </p>
<p>Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and use of SH [support helicopters], and the </p>
<p>possibility of deploying elements of the Divisional Reserve to ensure that essential </p>
<p>security and SSR could be sustained.”</p>
<p><b>379. </b> The update from Major General Mark Mans, Deputy Commanding General MNF&#8209;I, </p>
<p>on 20 July said that the attack on 16 July was “the fifth EFP incident in the vicinity” </p>
<p>of al&#8209;Amara since October 2004, including three devices which had been “found and </p>
<p>cleared”.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> The use of EFPs was “spreading”, including attacks in Mosul and Kirkuk. </p>
<p>Significant numbers had been used in attacks in Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> On 22 July, a UOR was submitted for additional armour to protect Warrior vehicles </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>381. </b> The UOR said that, although the last three EFP attacks had been directed at </p>
<p>Snatch vehicles, there was no reason why insurgents would not try to ambush Warrior </p>
<p>vehicles, especially if Warrior was used “more in the future due to EFP attacks”. It was </p>
<p>“not possible” to protect Snatch, CVR(T), FV430 and Saxon against EFPs; the only </p>
<p>vehicle that could be “better protected” was Warrior. Warrior was currently being used </p>
<p>as the lead and rear vehicle for all convoys in Maysan province.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>382. </b> The UOR for additional Warrior armour was approved and the MOD told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that that was fitted to vehicles in September 2005.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p><b>383. </b> The minutes from the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 27 July stated:</p>
<p>“Following the recent attacks in Maysan, procedures have been modified to </p>
<p>counter the threat: TF [Taskforce] Maysan were now conducting patrols in Warrior, </p>
<p>and would not automatically respond to IED incidents to avoid being caught in </p>
<p>secondary explosions. An additional Warrior company and the Telic Reserve RE </p>
<p>[Royal Engineer] Search Team (from Cyprus) had been deployed into the area, with </p>
<p>the latter able to provide a surge capacity for up to 60 days. The current cycle of </p>
<p>attacks had ‘fixed’ CF [coalition forces] in the area and, as a result, progress on SSR </p>
<p>had stagnated; PJHQ had therefore asked for an urgent review of UK SH [support </p>
<p>helicopters] priorities, to see if further assets could be allocated to MND(SE) …”</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>384. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Chiefs of Staff that work on PIR IED countermeasures </p>
<p>continued, “but thus far they were only effective at very short range”:</p>
<p>“The importance was therefore stressed of countering the threat by all means </p>
<p>possible, including TTPs. DCDS(EC) confirmed that appropriate action was being </p>
<p>taken at the right tempo, and that the work was joined up with US efforts to counter </p>
<p>similar threats elsewhere in Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>385. </b> On 30 July, two British security guards employed by Control Risks Group were </p>
<p>killed while travelling in an armoured vehicle in Basra.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> The deaths were later attributed </p>
<p>to PIR EFPs.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>386. </b> AM Torpy’s report of his visit to Iraq in late July 2005 addressed the PIR EFP IED </p>
<p>attacks:</p>
<p>“With the exception of Maysan, incident levels across the AOR [Area of </p>
<p>Responsibility] remain low and there are no major issues. In Maysan, significant </p>
<p>effort is focused on building up an intelligence picture of the group suspected of </p>
<p>carrying out the EFP/PIR attacks … whilst at the same time improving overall force </p>
<p>protection measures. The GOC is also keen to gain more visibility of possible Iranian </p>
<p>infiltration across the border … and maintain the pace of SSR in Maysan.”</p>

<p><b>387. </b> On 3 August, Maj Gen Dutton reported:</p>
<p>“… the threat from IEDs is worrying, with our Electronic Countermeasures unable </p>
<p>to defend against the victim operated Passive Infra Red and the use of EFPs and </p>
<p>(in the most recent attack) shaped charges able to penetrate armoured vehicles </p>
<p>[…] if used accurately. This technology has now been used across MND(SE) and </p>
<p>indeed further north having first been seen in Maysan.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>388. </b> Following Lord Drayson’s visit to Iraq in early July, Mr Ingram sought advice on the </p>
<p>protective capability of RAF Land Rovers on 19 August.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>389. </b> PJHQ advised that three Land Rover variants were used by the RAF Regiment, </p>
<p>of which Snatch was “the most highly protected”. Its allocation across theatres was </p>
<p>“centrally managed” on the basis of “relative priority” for those troops most at risk. </p>
<p>That inevitably meant:</p>
<p>“… compromises which mean that individual theatres receive fewer than is ideal. </p>
<p>That said, a greater allocation of Snatch to Iraq is not currently judged to be </p>
<p>operationally essential.”</p>
<p><b>390. </b> PJHQ wrote that there were “some 380 Snatch Land Rovers deployed” in Iraq, </p>
<p>“(including 64 Snatch 2), against a liability of 420”. The Snatch 2 programme was under </p>
<p>way and 66 of the “updated vehicles” had already arrived in theatre. </p>
<p><b>391. </b> There were “no spare Snatch” to deploy to Iraq, and the production line was </p>
<p>“currently devoted to non&#8209;air conditioned variants”. The programme would “not address </p>
<p>the numbers” of vehicles available but would “enhance the capability” of the vehicles </p>
<p>deployed. DLO intended to return the number of Snatch deployed in Iraq to the agreed </p>
<p>level of 420 “as soon as suitable vehicles” were produced. </p>
<p><b>392. </b> The process of allocating priorities in Iraq, in common with all operations, involved </p>
<p>“acceptance of risk in some areas”. While PJHQ sought “to reduce this risk as much </p>
<p>as possible”, it was “impossible to eliminate”. Since Lord Drayson’s visit, six Snatch </p>
<p>vehicles had been allocated to the RAF Regiment. The number of vehicles allocated </p>
<p>to the RAF Regiment was “judged to be commensurate with current threat levels” and </p>
<p>would “continue to be subject to review”. </p>
<p><b>393. </b> PJHQ stated that: “Theatre assigns its Snatch assets in line with the currently </p>
<p>assessed areas of highest risk and operational policy.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>394. </b> Draft press lines stated that British lives were not being put at unnecessary risk. </p>
<p>Service personnel used:</p>
<p>“… the vehicles most appropriate to the missions and tasks they are undertaking. </p>
<p>If the threat level increases, so do the protective and preventative measures taken, </p>
<p>for example by using Warrior Infantry Fighting vehicles.”</p>
<p><b>395. </b> The key message was that British forces were:</p>
<p>“… equipped with the most suitable and best protected vehicles for the job in hand. </p>
<p>The allocation of vehicles on Op TELIC is therefore constantly reviewed in line with </p>
<p>the currently assessed areas of highest risk and operational priority.”</p>
<p><b>396. </b> Mr Ingram’s Private Office recorded on 24 August that he had noted the advice.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>397. </b> In late August, in response to tasking from Lieutenant General Robin Brims, who </p>
<p>had become Senior British Military Representative&#8209;Iraq in April, the DIS, PJHQ and </p>
<p>MND(SE) assessed Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr’s strategy and future intentions: </p>
<p>“Given past casualties and the increasing sophistication of recent attacks, we </p>
<p>expect such action in the future to mainly consist of limited engagements, standoff </p>
<p>attacks and deniable operations including the use of technologically advanced </p>
<p>Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), (incorporating Passive Infra&#8209;Red sensors </p>
<p>(PIR), Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFP), and Remote Controlled (RC) arming), </p>
<p>of Lebanese Hizballah/IRGC QF design. It is assessed such IED attacks are not </p>
<p>being directed by JAM as an organisation but it appears that certain Shia extremists, </p>
<p>who may also belong to JAM, are co&#8209;operating with external actors to conduct </p>
<p>such attacks.”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>398. </b> On 26 August, Dr John Reid, who had become Defence Secretary in May, was </p>
<p>provided with advice from a junior official in the Directorate of Joint Commitments about </p>
<p>how the MOD intended to counter the threat posed by the PIR IEDs.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>399. </b> The official stated that technical work on a countermeasure was at an “advanced </p>
<p>stage” and that the UK should deploy a pre&#8209;detonation capability (M*</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>) to Iraq as soon </p>
<p>as one was technically available, subject to securing UOR funding. That was expected </p>
<p>to be around October 2005. The initial estimate of cost was £35m.</p>
<p><b>400. </b> The official also warned that PIR detonation was the insurgents’ response to </p>
<p>existing ECM and that it was likely that any UK response would be met with further </p>
<p>adaptation resulting in yet further ECM requirements.</p>

<p>he reported:</p>
<p>“The recent spate of IED attacks in Basra appears to be employing the same EFP/</p>

<p>against key individuals in these groups … with the aim of conducting offensive </p>
<p>operations at the earliest appropriate moment … On the defensive side, it is </p>

<p>to see what can be done to increase the hours available from the aircraft currently </p>
<p>in theatre. On the ground a great deal of work is under way to refine TTPs and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>“we had forgotten institutionally how to deal with this” after the long period of ceasefire </p>
<p>in Northern Ireland. </p>
<p><b>409. </b> Lt Gen Riley added that “the armour on the Warrior and Challenger main battle </p>
<p>tanks was upgraded very rapidly”. The Snatch vehicles were also upgraded and  </p>
<p>“a new series of vehicles which were more effective” were introduced. But “the sort </p>
<p>of vehicles that we employ now in Afghanistan were just not in production” and there </p>
<p>was “no technological silver bullet” to address the problem. The US was still “relying </p>
<p>on the Humvee … largely”. The UK “had not procured anything and there was little on </p>
<p>the market that could have been deployed to assist me”.</p>
<p><b>410. </b> When the Inquiry asked whether the IED threat had been brought to his attention </p>
<p>during his time as Defence Secretary, Mr Hoon said:</p>
<p>“I think it was beginning to develop at the time that I left the department [May 2005] </p>
<p>yes.”</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Asked whether the UK was unable to move around in a protected way once the </p>
<p>insurgency in Iraq developed, Sir Kevin Tebbit replied:</p>
<p>“I don’t think … that was not anticipated because of lack of money. I think that was </p>
<p>not anticipated because we hadn’t seen the threat evolving as rapidly as it did with </p>
<p>IEDs and roadside bombs. That developed so very quickly from 2004.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>412. </b> Sir Kevin added: “I think the roadside bomb, the IED threat evolved very, very </p>
<p>rapidly in a way we hadn’t anticipated, and we hadn’t really got grounds to have </p>
<p>expected, frankly.” </p>
<p><b>413. </b> Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry that the circumstances in Iraq:</p>
<p>“… became very difficult from the summer of 2005, particularly most dramatically </p>
<p>evidenced by the appearance of … explosively formed projectiles, in threes, that </p>
<p>were sufficiently effective that even our most protected vehicles were at risk …”</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>414. </b> When asked by the Inquiry what he was being asked to produce to support force </p>
<p>readiness for the growing insurgency, Gen Dannatt said: “The critical deficiency was </p>
<p>force protection measures, vehicles in particular.”<b> </b></p>
<p><b>415. </b> At their meeting on 5 October, the Chiefs of Staff noted that “the high tempo of </p>
<p>insurgent PIR technological and tactical innovation was forcing equally rapid evolution </p>
<p>of Coalition countermeasures”.</p>

<p><b>416. </b> On 13 October, a DIS report of the technical influence of foreign fighters on the </p>
<p>insurgencies in Iraq judged:</p>
<p>“Of key concern is the possible state sponsorship of insurgent groups in Iraq. </p>
<p>Highly lethal Improvised Explosive Devices of Lebanese Hizballah origin, probably </p>
<p>migrating from Iran to Iraq, continue to pose a significant challenge to coalition </p>
<p>forces and in particular the UK forces in MND(SE).”</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>417. </b> The DIS report continued:</p>
<p>“The development of the IED capability in Iraq has been rapid. By way of </p>
<p>comparison, the level of IED expertise reached by the IRA over some 30 years of </p>
<p>conflict in Northern Ireland has been far exceeded by Iraqi insurgents in less than </p>
<p>three years. This rapid progress is largely attributable to the technical influence of </p>
<p>foreign fighters, many of whom view Iraq as the centre of a global jihad.”</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Following a visit to Iraq from 10 to 13 October, Gen Jackson reported:</p>
<p>“Much of MND(SE)’s tactical focus has been on countering the EFP/PIR threat. </p>
<p>TTPs have been amended and Project M* is delivering an effective interim technical </p>
<p>countermeasure. But the enemy will adapt too, so we remain alive to the threat for </p>
<p>some time yet. It is clear that the Scientific Advisor and his team in HQ MND(SE) </p>
<p>have been instrumental in developing these countermeasures so rapidly and </p>
<p>efficiently …”</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>419. </b> It was agreed on 14 October that 14 Warrior vehicles that were due to be returned </p>
<p>to the UK should remain in Iraq.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> An additional Merlin helicopter would also be </p>
<p>provided. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> On 18 October, Sergeant Chris Hickey, who had disembarked from his vehicle, </p>
<p>was killed in Basra when his patrol was hit by an IED.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>421. </b> At the end of October, Dr Reid reported to Cabinet that UK forces had, since May, </p>
<p>been attacked by “a new type of bomb which had previously been associated mainly </p>
<p>with Hizballah”.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>422. </b> On 31 October, Dr Reid wrote to Mr Des Browne, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Browne agreed to the request on 11 November.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>THE IMPACT ON WIDER CIVILIAN OPERATIONS</p>
<p><b>424. </b> The IED threat constrained the UK’s ability to deliver Security Sector Reform (SSR) </p>
<p>and Civil Military Co&#8209;operation (CIMIC) as military officers, police officers and civilian </p>
<p>personnel were unable to move safely around MND(SE).</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry that he had an “optimistic” briefing from the MOD </p>
<p>before he started as GOC MND(SE) – that his role was to keep SSR “ticking over” – but </p>
<p>that was skewed “massively” by the increased EFP threat when he arrived in Basra.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>426. </b> On 11 November, Chief Constable Paul Kernaghan, the lead on international </p>
<p>affairs for the Association of Chief Police Officers, contacted the Home Office to express </p>
<p>concern about a report that Maj Gen Dutton had stated that he wanted to see civilian </p>
<p>police personnel travel in Snatch vehicles, and that Maj Gen Dutton had suggested he </p>
<p>would review – or even terminate – the relevant contracts of employment to ensure that </p>
<p>was possible.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>427. </b> On 20 November, Sergeant John Jones was killed whilst on patrol in Basra </p>
<p>when his vehicle hit a roadside IED.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> Four others sustained injuries in the attack, </p>
<p>one seriously.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Gen Walker visited Iraq from 22 to 24 November.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> His visit report stated that </p>
<p>there was no “sole technical answer” to IEDs and “defensive tactics, techniques and </p>
<p>procedures, and disruption of the terrorists, were essential parts of an overall solution”. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> On 29 November, Major General William Rollo, ACGS from January 2005, reported </p>
<p>to Gen Jackson on his recent trip to Iraq:</p>
<p>“The PIR IED threat is of real concern, and we are now more fixed by force </p>
<p>protection than ever before. The effect of these weapons is constraining activity </p>
<p>across all lines of operation, including SSR. Whilst overall numbers of attacks across </p>
<p>the division has reduced, the effectiveness of each attack has risen sharply and the </p>
<p>opposition now achieves a coalition casualty rate exceeding one killed for every PIR </p>
<p>attack conducted …”</p>

<p><b>431. </b> The FCO Senior Overseas Security Adviser visited Kirkuk, Baghdad and Basra </p>
<p>between 10 and 21 November.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“The Security Managers and CRG [Control Risks Group] are to be congratulated </p>
<p>on their professional control of road movement … It is clear that all road moves </p>
<p>are subject to risk … The use of helicopters is vital in order to change the pattern </p>
<p>of movements.</p>
<p>“We recommend that all staff in Basra can move in Warrior armoured vehicles.”</p>
<p><b>432. </b> Dr Reid visited Basra in early December.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> The report of his visit stated that he </p>
<p>had had “an opportunity to examine vehicles fitted with upgraded armour kits”. </p>
<p><b>433. </b> On 7 December, AM Torpy briefed the Chiefs of Staff that the discovery of a large </p>
<p>EFP suggested that rogue JAM elements “had intended to attack heavily armoured </p>
<p>Coalition vehicles, including Warrior”.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>434. </b> In his ‘Hauldown Report’ to AM Torpy of 12 December, Maj Gen Dutton wrote:</p>
<p>“… the dominant feature of the last four months of my … tour has been the victim </p>
<p>initiated passive infrared explosively formed projectile. This weapon, which has </p>
<p>now proliferated through Iraq has radically affected our freedom of manoeuvre </p>
<p>and consequently inhibited our Security Sector Reform and CIMIC effort. There is </p>
<p>a straight trade&#8209;off here: if troops are doing force protection, they cannot be doing </p>
<p>SSR. We are taking direct action against perpetrators … constantly amending our </p>
<p>TTPs and there is a huge scientific effort to produce counter measures. We will </p>
<p>never entirely defeat this threat, but it is manageable and I do not believe it has </p>
<p>a significantly deleterious effect on morale in this AO [Area of Operations].”</p>

<p>vehicles by DFID staff for mission critical visits to certain sites in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> Until </p>
<p>then, DFID staff had travelled in civilian rather than military vehicles because of their </p>
<p>lower profile, consistent with the nature of DFID’s work. </p>
<p><b>436. </b> Officials advised Mr Benn:</p>
<p>“… the continuing threat from EFPs in southern Iraq fundamentally compromises our </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>437. </b> Three days later, FCO officials recommended to Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary, “a safe and measured return to road moves” for civilian staff in the </p>
<p>South “in order to fully promote HMG objectives”.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> They proposed that, subject to </p>
<p>regular review:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>all civilian staff be allowed to travel in Warrior vehicles within Basra, where there </p>
<p>was a significant risk from armour piercing roadside bombs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK civilian police officers be able to travel with contracted British Iraqi Police </p>
<p>Advisers in their FCO armoured vehicles, escorted by UK military Snatch Land </p>
<p>Rovers; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>road moves in FCO armoured vehicles should restart along the main road from </p>
<p>Basra Airport to Nasiriyah and Basra Airport to Kuwait.</p>
<p><b>438. </b> Mr Straw approved the recommendations on 9 January 2006, provided the rules </p>
<p>were subject to regular review.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p><b>439. </b> In his post&#8209;tour report on 18 January, Maj Gen Dutton recorded:</p>
<p>“The most significant threat in MND(SE) derives from Passive Infra&#8209;red (PIR) </p>
<p>initiated EFP IED attacks on MNF patrols and civilian convoys … RCIEDs and </p>
<p>CWIEDs remain an extant threat … EFP IEDs […] were responsible for 18 fatalities </p>
<p>between Sept and Dec 05 …”</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>440. </b> Maj Gen Dutton reported that the “new and more complex IEDs allowed Shia </p>
<p>militants to conduct increasingly lethal attacks and effectively fix MNF by an extended </p>
<p>low intensity terrorist operation. This achieves the intent … by separating MNF from the </p>
<p>Shia community and allowing local JAM to fill the security vacuum.” </p>
<p><b>441. </b> In explaining the lessons from his tour, Maj Gen Dutton wrote: “The over&#8209;riding </p>
<p>operational imperative during this period has been the requirement to mitigate the </p>
<p>development and proliferation of PIR initiated IEDs.” </p>
<p><b>442. </b> Maj Gen Dutton stated that in some circumstances their effect had been </p>
<p>“particularly tangible” upon freedom of operation and had “resulted in significant </p>
<p>rebalancing of force structures” and “a rapid evolution and re&#8209;examination” of TTPs. </p>
<p>That had led to decisions to prohibit any ground movements, other than by Warrior or </p>
<p>Challenger vehicles, inside the towns of al&#8209;Amara and al&#8209;Majir al&#8209;Kabir in Maysan; and </p>
<p>subsequently, “stringent” Warrior&#8209;led convoys into Basra City and “the satellite bases”. </p>
<p>SSR had been “significantly curtailed”.</p>

<p>75</p>
<p><b>443. </b> Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry that less time was devoted to SSR because of the </p>
<p>need for greater force protection. Describing how the threat restricted movements in the </p>
<p>second half of his tour, he said:</p>
<p>“… my vehicles never left the compound, we did all movement by air, or if the </p>
<p>vehicles did move, they were in convoys protected by armoured vehicles.”</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>444. </b> Lieutenant General John Cooper, GOC MND(SE) from December 2005 to June </p>
<p>2006, told the Inquiry that, when he arrived in MND(SE), “on the security side, everything </p>
<p>was containable but there was this sense of increasing military activity, particularly from </p>
<p>[JAM]”.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> The introduction of PIR EFPs “had an impact on lower level tactical issues”. </p>
<p>That was an “issue with which we could deal, but it was sometimes unpleasant”.</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Lt Gen Cooper stated that the response from the UK’s “scientific and defence </p>
<p>community was very good, both in terms of personal equipment and vehicles”. </p>
<p><b>446. </b> In a statement to the Inquiry, Assistant Chief Constable Colin Smith, Chief Police </p>
<p>Adviser Iraq from May 2005 to April 2006, wrote:</p>
<p>“The ‘deteriorating’ security situation had a major influence on ability to progress </p>
<p>development plans. As attacks increased in MND(SE) movement became difficult … </p>
<p>Movement of CivPol [civilian police] became a further issue. As security deteriorated </p>
<p>CivPol officers needed increasingly to be escorted by substantial military resources </p>
<p>(Warrior Armoured Vehicles and helicopters). Their priority however was increasingly </p>
<p>lowered by the military … This caused serious difficulties in moving between sites </p>
<p>to attend meetings with staff often stranded overnight in various locations without </p>
<p>transport. It was not uncommon for officers to spend 2 or 3 days at the Basra APOD </p>
<p>[aerial point of departure] awaiting movement. Similar problems existed in Baghdad </p>
<p>with an FCO ‘fly only’ policy supported by insufficient helicopter resources. </p>
<p>“I do not criticise the military for this situation. As security and ‘war&#8209;fighting’ became </p>
<p>a greater priority, movement of civilians became a lesser priority.”</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>447. </b> Speaking to the Inquiry about his duty of care to UK police officers in Iraq, </p>
<p>CC Kernaghan said that he had not wanted his officers to travel in Snatch Land </p>
<p>Rovers.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> He said he “was quite clear that Snatch Land Rovers posed an unacceptable </p>
<p>risk”. CC Kernaghan added that this was not meant as a criticism of general officers who </p>
<p>deployed the military in Snatch vehicles because: “They had no alternative. You do what </p>
<p>you do with what you have got.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>448. </b> The DOC published its third report of Op TELIC lessons on 4 April 2006.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p><b>449. </b> The report contained a section on “National Issues” described as “issues that </p>
<p>warrant MOD’s attention due to the impact on operational capability”. Such issues </p>
<p>affected “not only Iraq but may have a wider significance for other operations, including </p>
<p>Afghanistan”. One of those issues was the UK’s counter&#8209;IED capability.</p>
<p><b>450. </b> The report highlighted how PIR IED and EFP attacks had restricted the SSR and </p>
<p>CIMIC effort, citing Maj Gen Dutton’s Hauldown Report. It stated: “The technology is </p>
<p>developing quickly and it is highly likely that it will migrate between theatres.” Countering </p>
<p>the IED threat had become a “tactical focus” and, while the MOD continued “to strive </p>
<p>to counter the long term threat”, it anticipated that the M* capability “should deliver an </p>
<p>effective interim countermeasure to the <i>current </i>threat”.</p>
<p><b>451. </b> The report stated that the “system” to counter IEDs was “made up of four </p>
<p>elements: threat awareness; operating in an IED threat environment; disposal of IEDs; </p>
<p>and development of CIED [counter&#8209;IED] capability”. For CIED capability to evolve into </p>
<p>“a coherent expeditionary capability”, integral components of that system needed to </p>
<p>migrate because “much of the capability currently deployed in Iraq is dependent upon </p>
<p>personnel and equipment on attachment from Northern Ireland”. If that did not happen, </p>
<p>there was a risk that CIED expertise would be lost when operations were drawn down </p>
<p>from Northern Ireland as part of the Peace Process. </p>
<p><b>452. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Inquiry that, when he arrived as </p>
<p>GOC MND(SE) in July 2006, there was “effectively no security at all”: “Any movement </p>
<p>required deliberate operation to … get around the city. There was a significant lack of </p>
<p>troops on the ground.”</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> He said that troops that could have been used on the ground </p>
<p>were perhaps “tied up guarding, securing convoys”.</p>
<p><b>Decisions on the wider protected mobility capability for the Army</b></p>
<p><b>453. </b> Over the same period, in mid&#8209;2005, the Army was continuing to voice concerns </p>
<p>about delays in the FRES programme.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> The origin of the FRES programme and the DMB’s decision in July 2004 to defer </p>
<p>its ISD were addressed earlier in this Section.</p>
<p><b>455. </b> Brig Moore and Brig Inshaw produced a paper on 18 May 2005 to inform ECAB </p>
<p>members on the progress of the FRES programme, prior to their meeting on 26 May.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper set out the “potential conflict” between capability decisions: a vehicle that </p>
<p>could be rapidly deployed by air could not also be the solution to a whole range of </p>
<p>medium weight ground vehicles that needed replacing. </p>

<p>77</p>
<p><b>456. </b> While the requirement to deploy quickly must be included, ECAB was asked to </p>
<p>endorse the FRES Steering Committee’s view,</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> that it “should not overly distort” the </p>
<p>need to provide “an effective family” of vehicles across “the full spectrum of operations”.</p>
<p><b>457. </b> ECAB agreed Brig Moore and Brig Inshaw’s recommendations on 26 May.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FRES Steering Committee “had identified a potential conflict of priorities between </p>
<p>FRES as an element of the medium weight capability, and FRES as the Army’s light and </p>
<p>medium Armoured Vehicle replacement programme”.</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Gen Jackson “said that ECAB agreed that the purpose of FRES was to equip the </p>
<p>balanced force and that within this, both the development of a medium weight capability </p>
<p>and the replacement of increasingly obsolete CVR(T), Saxon and FV430 fleets were </p>
<p>equally important”.</p>
<p><b>459. </b> On 8 June, Maj Gen Rollo set out the Army’s equipment priorities for the 2007 </p>
<p>Equipment Programme (EP07) in a paper that would go to ECAB later that month.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following the 2005 Programme, the challenge to identify savings while funding </p>
<p>necessary equipment enhancements to support current operations (including an </p>
<p>investment in light protected mobility) had meant that “a number of very painful savings </p>
<p>measures and slippages had to be absorbed”. FRES had been protected “apart from </p>
<p>a slip to 3 variants at the back end of the programme”.</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Maj Gen Rollo wrote that the slip in the FRES ISD suggested the Army “should </p>
<p>invest further in the transitional medium force” but any additional purchase “should not </p>
<p>threaten the FRES ISD”. Maj Gen Applegate’s team was “examining this issue in detail, </p>
<p>looking at innovative ways of finding the necessary resources and assessing the STP </p>
<p>and EP impacts”. It would report in July.</p>
<p><b>461. </b> It is not clear what the details and results of this work were as the minutes of the </p>
<p>next three ECAB meetings do not record that Maj Gen Applegate’s team reported back </p>
<p>to the Board in July.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> The MOD has been unable to find any supporting documents. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> Addressing the various programmes under way, Maj Gen Rollo wrote that there </p>
<p>was “a need in this planning cycle to determine the protected mobility requirements </p>
<p>for light forces across the Army”.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> He cited DUCKBOARD and Vector as examples of </p>
<p>“disparate programmes” that might need to be “rationalised” in the future programme to </p>
<p>“provide a coherent solution” for force protection.</p>
<p>240 </p>
<p>The Inquiry requested all meeting minutes from the FRES Steering Committee between 1 January </p>
<p>2005 and 1 January 2008. The MOD has been unable to locate any such records.</p>

<p>the identification of compensating reductions”.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>464. </b> Gen Jackson said that ECAB was content with the priorities listed and </p>
<p>“emphasised that war&#8209;fighting must continue to determine the Army’s equipment </p>
<p>priorities”. He said that there should be “a sharper focus on FRES, emphasising the </p>
<p>delivery of the programme”.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> At the ECAB meeting on 22 September, Gen Jackson explained that, whilst </p>
<p>progress on the FRES programme continued, “he feared a slip in the ISD”.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>“would be very damaging to the Army”. The minutes record that Gen Dannatt “reinforced </p>
<p>this point”. ECAB would “need to make strong representations” to the Chief of Defence </p>
<p>Procurement and DCDS(EC).</p>
<p><b>466. </b> On 14 November, ECAB discussed a report of the Army’s performance between </p>
<p>1 July and 30 September.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Maj Gen Rollo had produced a paper on the areas of under&#8209;performance, </p>
<p>which reported that Gen Dannatt had emphasised “an equipment issue of immediate </p>
<p>concern”.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> Gen Dannatt was quoted as saying:</p>
<p>“Our patrol vehicles routinely deployed on current operations … are vulnerable and </p>
<p>we are suffering casualties. Snatch has poor mobility, inadequate protection and is </p>
<p>unreliable due largely to its hard use. We are working with PJHQ to address vehicle </p>
<p>and ECM issues and to develop TTPs, but there is a need to bring a clarity to the </p>
<p>requirement for protected patrol vehicles. In addition, I am concerned at the lack </p>
<p>of [Type] B vehicle protection more generally. I recognise that it may take time to </p>
<p>deliver a solution, but we face the prospect of continuing operations in Iraq into 2008 </p>
<p>as well as in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Maj Gen Rollo’s asked ECAB to note Gen Dannatt’s concern and “consider </p>
<p>whether any additional measures can bring greater clarity to vehicle protection </p>
<p>requirements”.</p>
<p><b>469. </b> The minutes of the ECAB meeting on 14 November do not record any specific </p>
<p>discussion of Gen Dannatt’s concerns at the meeting but the subject of protected </p>
<p>mobility was discussed more broadly.</p>

<p><b>470. </b> In considering the “failure to provide appropriate protected mobility on operations”, </p>
<p>ECAB noted that the mitigating action to cover the risk included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Improve ECM: two sets of the new equipment had been delivered to Iraq in </p>
<p>a trial to meet the threat from IEDs.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Replace Snatch 1 with Snatch 2/Vector: Snatch 2 was more reliable than </p>
<p>Snatch 1 but still had the same protection and mobility characteristics. Although </p>
<p>money had been allocated towards the Vector project, a vehicle solution had yet </p>
<p>to be identified.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Examine early replacement of Saxon with Warrior/improved FV430: Warrior </p>
<p>is the only vehicle currently available to the Army which provided significant </p>
<p>protection against EFP IEDs. Any additional battalions equipped with Warrior to </p>
<p>fill the AV [Armoured Vehicle] gap on operations need only be trained on its use </p>
<p>for mobility requirements and not full manoeuvre capability.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Maintain FRES ISD of 2012.”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> At its meeting on 19 January 2006, ECAB was given a presentation on the </p>
<p>progress of the Assessment Phase for FRES in the light of the critical decisions required </p>
<p>for the programme to maintain momentum, including the extent to which “the Army was </p>
<p>prepared to compromise on capability … to achieve an early ISD” for FRES.</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> Final </p>
<p>decisions would be taken by Ministers on the advice of the IAB.</p>
<p><b>472. </b> In a paper for ECAB about the FRES Fleet Review, Brig Moore concluded that </p>
<p>further work was necessary and the earliest that an initial operating capability (which </p>
<p>would meet the requirements for survivability and future growth) could be achieved was </p>
<p>2015 to 2018.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p><b>473. </b> The paper stated that full operating capability would not be delivered until beyond </p>
<p>2023. That meant that some elements of the current fleet would be over 60 years old </p>
<p>before they were taken out of service, and additional funding would be required. </p>
<p><b>474. </b> The paper stated that, although the US Stryker vehicle could be procured to fulfil </p>
<p>the Utility FRES variant “around 2013”, that option had been discounted because it </p>
<p>would only be available in its current configuration. For the “FRES era”, this model </p>
<p>offered insufficient protection, lacked growth potential and the UK was unlikely to be able </p>
<p>to make any necessary modifications to it.</p>
<p><b>475. </b> A second paper by Brig Moore, on the implications of the Fleet Review on the </p>
<p>Army’s AV capability, detailed how the FRES delays had “exacerbated” the Armoured </p>
<p>Personnel Carrier (APC) vehicle gap; Saxon’s limitations made it unsafe for use on </p>
<p>operations but there was currently no alternative vehicle available.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>asked Brig Moore to identify the options to fill this gap until FRES was able to enter </p>
<p>service. </p>
<p><b>476. </b> In considering whether PPVs could offer a solution, Brig Moore outlined the </p>
<p>differences between the FRES APC requirement and PPV capabilities:</p>
<p>“… PPV [sic] has a limited degree of protection and mobility, and is designed around </p>
<p>a patrol mission of up to 8 hours. These vehicles are not organic to units, but are </p>
<p>issued in theatre as required. Originally designed as a specialist NI capability, the </p>
<p>requirement for PPV in all theatres is becoming enduring …”</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Brig Moore wrote that the in service PPV capability was provided by Snatch </p>
<p>vehicles, which were being upgraded and completion was expected by August 2006. </p>
<p>The Vector programme would deliver “about 80” vehicles. The original requirement had </p>
<p>been for 153 but “further risk” had been taken “for reasons of affordability”. Vector would </p>
<p>not replace Snatch and its protection levels would be “less than Saxon”. </p>
<p><b>478. </b> Brig Moore stated:</p>
<p>“Whilst new PPVs cannot fill the APC gap, they may help to mitigate its impact, </p>
<p>especially on operations in the short term. The longer term plan for PPVs is currently </p>
<p>being scoped by DCI(A) [Brig Inshaw].”</p>
<p><b>479. </b> Brig Moore concluded that the “most effective way” to address the issue was by </p>
<p>“a combination of upgrading and managing in&#8209;service AVs”. That would have an impact </p>
<p>on the AV fleet, but further work was necessary to “confirm the most operationally </p>
<p>appropriate and cost effective mix” and to assess how much risk could be carried.</p>
<p><b>480. </b> Gen Jackson stated at the meeting that the Army was “disappointed by the </p>
<p>conclusions” of the review, “but it was vital that ECAB understood how such conclusions </p>
<p>had been reached and the implications for the in&#8209;service armoured vehicle fleet”.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p><b>481. </b> ECAB agreed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“FRES was the Army’s highest priority and that, given the future threat, the </p>
<p>requirement was fully justified. It would be important to get the DMB engaged in </p>
<p>the whole Armoured Vehicle Fleet issue so that it was seen as a priority in terms </p>
<p>of resources.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FRES Fleet Review Outcome Paper with some amendments, including that:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The programme should “aim to achieve the earliest possible” ISD and </p>
<p>full operating capability by “challenging traditional acquisition models and </p>
<p>seeking an incremental introduction of capability”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>It would be necessary to update and upgrade FV430 and CVR(T) and </p>
<p>replace Saxon. </p>

<p><b>483. </b> Gen Jackson set out how the FRES programme had failed to keep up with planned </p>

<p>“extremely unpalatable”.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Gen Jackson wrote that ECAB had concluded that there was “an urgent </p>
<p>non&#8209;discretionary requirement to maintain adequate military capability and protected </p>
<p>mobility” until FRES came into service, and that there was “a clear moral responsibility to </p>
<p>do the best we can to safeguard soldiers’ lives in the interim”. That would include plans </p>
<p>“to run on – and upgrade” FV430 and CVR(T) vehicles to fill the gap. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>488. </b> On 3 February, Lt Gen Fulton advised Mr Jeffrey how the MOD intended “to deliver </p>
<p>a coherent armoured vehicle capability which meets current and future needs, against </p>
<p>the background of the wish to make an early announcement to reassure the public, </p>
<p>industry and the Army that the MOD is on top of the issue”.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>489. </b> Lt Gen Fulton recommended that Mr Jeffrey should note that: </p>
<p>“a.  Urgent work is under way to identify and cost options to meet Defence’s short </p>
<p>term need for armoured vehicles which meet the increased demand of current </p>
<p>operations and to consider whether timescales and capability can be advanced </p>
<p>by making an early commitment.</p>
<p>b.  The armoured vehicle work builds on the Defence Industrial strategy … and the </p>
<p>more general armoured fighting vehicle work with industry.</p>
<p>c.  Concurrent work is considering how the Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) </p>
<p>project can be accelerated to meet Defence’s longer term need for armoured </p>
<p>capability.” </p>
<p><b>490. </b> Lt Gen Fulton advised that work “during the FRES Assessment Phase” had </p>
<p>“indicated” that it was “very unlikely” that an initial operating capability could be achieved </p>
<p>before 2015; and that was “principally driven by the need to ensure” that it was “capable </p>
<p>of future weight growth (in order to achieve protection requirements over a long life) and </p>
<p>technology insertion”.</p>
<p><b>491. </b> Addressing the implications of that delay, including the need to retain existing </p>
<p>armoured vehicles with recognised deficiencies, Lt Gen Fulton wrote: “Work has been </p>
<p>under way since July 2005 to identify the full implications for the armoured vehicle fleet </p>
<p>of these deficiencies, and to consider how to address them.” The FV430 and CVR(T) </p>
<p>fleets were facing obsolescence but that could be managed to a degree. They would </p>
<p>need up&#8209;armouring to meet the threat level faced in Iraq. Saxon was described as </p>
<p>“insufficiently effective”. The funding provided for FRES in the Equipment Programme </p>
<p>would be examined “to identify opportunities to fund enhancements to the existing </p>
<p>AV fleet”.</p>
<p><b>492. </b> Mr Jeffrey forwarded Lt Gen Fulton’s advice to Lord Drayson, agreeing that the </p>
<p>issue should be looked at urgently for a number of reasons, including that “the increased </p>
<p>demands of current operations” had “exposed weaknesses in what was already a fleet </p>
<p>facing obsolescence”.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>493. </b> Mr Jeffrey stated that the DMB would discuss the deficiencies of the existing </p>
<p>armoured vehicle fleet on 9 March and it “may be that there will be opportunities to </p>
<p>deploy funds previously earmarked for FRES”. FRES would be discussed by the IAB </p>
<p>on 9 February.</p>

<p><b>494. </b> Mr Jeffrey promised a progress report after the DMB in March, stating:</p>
<p>“My aim is to put the Secretary of State and you in a position to make a clear </p>
<p>early public statement on FRES and plans for armoured vehicle capability in the </p>
<p>intervening period before FRES comes into service, to give confidence that we are </p>
<p>addressing the issue responsibly.” </p>
<p><b>495. </b> The MOD has not been able to provide a complete record of the DMB meeting held </p>
<p>on 9 March, but the summary of conclusions makes no specific reference to FRES.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>496. </b> The summary of the record did state that the DMB had concluded “that there was </p>
<p>a stronger continuing operational requirement for FV430 overhaul and upgrade than </p>
<p>had been assumed in STP05”. It was decided that sufficient additional resources should </p>
<p>be provided to cover this cost in 2006&#8209;2007 and the longer&#8209;term requirement would be </p>
<p>reviewed in STP/EP07.</p>
<p><b>497. </b> ECAB met on 16 March.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>498. </b> The minutes of the meeting stated that Lord Drayson’s: </p>
<p>“… visit to Land had gone well, and the Minister understood the importance of FRES; </p>
<p>the implications of the new ISD [In Service Date]; the need for an interim solution to </p>
<p>plug the gap … and the requirement to improve Protected Patrol Vehicles (PPVs).” </p>
<p><b>499. </b> On 17 March, Mr Jeffrey wrote to Lord Drayson with an update on armoured </p>
<p>vehicle capability following the DMB’s discussion of the subject on 9 March.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>500. </b> Mr Jeffrey stated that the discussion was “set in the context of the wider financial </p>
<p>position in 2006/07 and the other demands on our resources; including the desire to </p>
<p>bring forward the buy of the 5th C17, higher fuel prices … and a range of other matters”. </p>
<p><b>501. </b> The DMB view was that “the majority of issues should be resolved in the wider </p>
<p>EP/STP planning round, but that there were grounds for taking some decisions early”. </p>
<p>That included replacing Saxon and the overhaul of the FV430 series of vehicles “to </p>
<p>provide a better capability for mechanised infantry”. The resources for the conversion </p>
<p>of vehicles for use on Op TELIC would be sought through a UOR. </p>
<p><b>502. </b> Mr Jeffrey said that the DMB had discussed the “high priority” of ensuring </p>
<p>FRES was delivered “as early as possible”. Lt Gen Fulton was tasked to prioritise </p>
<p>the requirement for FRES funding in 2006/07 in the context of “other capability </p>
<p>requirements, and any other cost pressures on the Equipment Programme” in 2006/07.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Mr Jeffrey’s minute stated that the requirement for PPVs was “distinct from the </p>
<p>armoured vehicle capability, but PPV may help to mitigate shortfalls over the next few </p>
<p>years”. The Vector contract “for at least 62 vehicles” was imminent and “options to </p>
<p>deliver more” would be considered in the planning round.</p>
<p><b>505. </b> On 24 April, Maj Gen Rollo told ECAB that co&#8209;ordinated work on “the FRES/AV </p>
<p>Gap” was “in hand for STP/EP07 and STP/EP08”.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> Two programme reviews were </p>
<p>ongoing, including an Armoured Vehicle strategy and “Armoured Vehicle Through Life </p>
<p>Management Plan”. Lord Drayson “was fully engaged in this issue and the Army should </p>
<p>capitalise on this”. </p>
<p><b>506. </b> Mr Des Browne replaced Dr Reid as Defence Secretary in May 2006. </p>
<p><b>507. </b> On 25 May, Mr Browne was advised by a junior MOD official to write to Mr Stephen </p>
<p>Timms, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to seek an uplift in UOR funding to begin </p>
<p>up&#8209;armouring the FV430 fleet for Iraq “as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> A business case for </p>
<p>£6m to procure the “long&#8209;lead items” for this project had been approved in April 2006.</p>
<p><b>508. </b> The FV430 fleet had not previously operated outside MNF bases as they fell short </p>
<p>of the force protection levels required, but Mr Browne stated:</p>
<p>“It is anticipated that there will be an increasing requirement for the FV430 fleet to </p>
<p>deploy in a more overt capacity over the coming months, necessitating appropriate </p>
<p>protection against the associated exposure to prevalent threats.”</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr Timms approved the proposal on 15 June.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>510. </b> On 21 June, the DMB received two presentations; one about medium weight </p>
<p>capability, and one about FRES.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> The minutes do not make clear what constituted </p>
<p>medium weight capability for the purposes of the meeting but stated that it was a </p>
<p>valuable “over the horizon” capability that was much broader than FRES, although </p>
<p>FRES “formed an important part of it”. It was a joint capability to which all three Services </p>
<p>contributed. It did not appear from the minutes that either presentation related to PPVs. </p>
<p><b>511. </b> The DMB concluded that FRES was the Army’s highest priority equipment </p>
<p>programme after support to operations. FRES would be in service for many decades </p>
<p>and it would be essential that there was growth potential and realism about timelines. </p>
<p>The Board noted “with concern” that the programme was taking longer than originally </p>
<p>anticipated. That was attributed to the time it had taken to understand the requirement </p>
<p>properly, to plan, research and de&#8209;risk the programme. The delays were operationally </p>

<p>be available before March 2007.</p>
<p><b>516. </b> The business case stated that “initial scoping studies” for a Vector vehicle solution </p>
<p>had considered “an increased capacity Snatch” but that had not been successful and </p>
<p>would not be considered any further as a suitable platform for Vector. That was due to </p>
<p>a “complete inability” to meet the Key User Requirement concerning the weight it was </p>
<p>expected to carry.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Snatch 2 vehicles had been deployed to Afghanistan but had been “restricted to </p>

<p>offer a “substantial increase in the performance to that of Snatch 2 in terms of protection, </p>
<p>mobility and capacity”. On protection it stated: </p>
<p>“It can be seen that Vector can be used in a more hostile environment than Snatch </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>520. </b> There was a reference to the SOR produced on 21 February 2005 stating that the </p>
<p>requirement for PPVs on a global and enduring basis was 1,030 vehicles: 877 Snatch </p>
<p>2 and 153 Vector vehicles. The business case stated that financial limitations currently </p>
<p>constrained the numbers to 624 Snatch 2 and 62 Vector vehicles. The risk arising from </p>
<p>the shortfall in vehicles would be managed by “the PPV management committee” but:</p>
<p>“Initially all of the procured vehicles will be deployed on Op HERRICK due to the </p>
<p>improved mobility that Vector offers over Snatch 2A.”</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>521. </b> A requirement for 166 PPVs had been endorsed for Op HERRICK. That would </p>
<p>initially be met through the deployment of Snatch 2A but 62 would be withdrawn and </p>
<p>replaced with Vector during roll&#8209;out. The 62 withdrawn vehicles would be “redeployed </p>
<p>to reduce risk taken on expeditionary operations” which was “expected to be Op TELIC”.</p>
<p><b>522. </b> A commercial off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf option was recommended as the means to deliver the </p>
<p>capability as there were “a number of manufacturers who produce armoured vehicles </p>
<p>which would fulfil the requirements of Project Vector” and some of those vehicles were </p>
<p>in service with “other armed forces”. There was “insufficient time” to develop a bespoke </p>
<p>option.</p>
<p><b>523. </b> Lord Drayson’s copy of the business case was annotated by his Assistant Private </p>
<p>Secretary on 7 March.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“For info only and low priority. Worth a skim solely because it deals with armoured </p>
<p>vehicles (albeit light ones), is described CinC Land’s ‘highest priority’ and you will </p>
<p>see him on Friday!”</p>
<p><b>524. </b> On 9 March, Lord Drayson noted: “Following visit let’s get focused on this </p>
<p>project.”</p>

<p>the 3 March business case and Lord Drayson’s visit to Land Command.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> Lord Drayson </p>
<p>understood “that the vehicles are required for the March 2007 Afghanistan roulement”, </p>
<p>and it would be important that work was completed “on schedule by September”. </p>

<p>87</p>
<p><b>527. </b> On 22 March, Lord Drayson’s Private Office recorded that:</p>
<p>“Given the present tempo of operations, and the threat the Army are typically </p>
<p>facing during deployments, Lord Drayson believes it is imperative that we </p>
<p>ensure we are providing them (in both the near and long term) with appropriately </p>
<p>protected vehicles. This will clearly involve both addressing the present operational </p>
<p>requirement, and ensuring that FRES is brought into service no later than 2012.”</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>528. </b> On 22 March, an MOD official from DCRS(BM) advised Lord Drayson on how </p>
<p>the remaining 104 Vector vehicles (from the 166 total) might be procured with Treasury </p>
<p>funding.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> The manufacturer would be working “flat out” to produce the initial purchase </p>
<p>and there was “no scope to produce either more vehicles [between March and May </p>
<p>2007], or bring forward the delivery timeline”.</p>
<p><b>529. </b> Approval had been given to buy as many vehicles as the available funding would </p>
<p>allow but, due to the late inclusion of an additional protection measure against EFPs, </p>
<p>it was “possible” that fewer than 62 would be purchased.</p>
<p><b>530. </b> The official added that there were “anticipated requirements for future PPV </p>
<p>capabilities in the short and long terms”. Lord Drayson was advised that a follow&#8209;on </p>
<p>purchase could be made in the short term either through UOR or Equipment Programme </p>
<p>action to meet the “full Defence wide requirement”.</p>
<p><b>531. </b> Considering the UOR route, the official wrote that the requirement for additional </p>
<p>Vector vehicles had not been included in the financial estimate for Afghanistan approved </p>
<p>by Cabinet. It was therefore not advised to approach Treasury until the operational </p>
<p>requirement was “sufficiently mature”, coupled with some operational experience of </p>
<p>Snatch’s performance in Afghanistan. Delaying a UOR until September would not </p>
<p>have an impact on the delivery schedule, given that the manufacturer was working at </p>
<p>maximum capacity to deliver the first tranche of vehicles. “Initial informal soundings” </p>
<p>from the Treasury were that: </p>
<p>“… not only would the requirement need to be robust (ie a clear explanation of why </p>
<p>Snatch, for which they have already provided UOR funding is not appropriate at </p>
<p>all for Op HERRICK, and that no other in&#8209;service vehicle … would not fill the gap), </p>
<p>but also that the costs would need to fall within our currently negotiated funding </p>
<p>envelope.”</p>
<p><b>532. </b> Raising an Equipment Programme enhancement option was an alternative route to </p>
<p>secure the vehicles which again would not have an impact on the delivery schedule. The </p>
<p>official advised that, whilst it was “likely” that procuring additional Vector vehicles would </p>
<p>be seen as “a high priority across Defence”, it was noted that “other competing priorities </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>in EP07” meant that there was no guarantee that funding would be found. The official </p>
<p>gave three examples of those priorities, one of which was additional FRES funding. </p>
<p><b>533. </b> The official did not recommend which option Lord Drayson should approve. It was </p>
<p>also stated that longer&#8209;term consideration was needed to understand “how this enduring </p>
<p>capability might be met, to replace the Snatch/Vector mix”.</p>
<p><b>534. </b> Lord Drayson was also informed that, of the £74.5m the DMB had allocated to the </p>
<p>PPV programme in FY 2005/06, £11m would not be spent. </p>
<p><b>535. </b> Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry that, from the time of the announcement in June 2004 </p>
<p>that the Headquarters ARRC would be deployed to Afghanistan in 2006, “whatever was </p>
<p>happening in Iraq and however Iraq was going to develop, there was going to be another </p>
<p>operation in Afghanistan in the middle of 2006”; and that:</p>
<p>“… everything as far as I was concerned to do with Iraq from the time that I became </p>
<p>Commander in Chief in March 2005 was not just in the context uniquely of Iraq, but </p>
<p>in the wider context of ‘… and we are going to be involved in Afghanistan as well’.”</p>
<p>277</p>
<p><b>536. </b> Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry that, in his view: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Afghanistan was “perhaps much more important to get right”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“resourcing the operation in Afghanistan was particularly important”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Afghanistan would always develop as being the main effort”.</p>
<p><b>537. </b> Referring to the decision to procure Vector vehicles, Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that one of the brigades going into Afghanistan “had no vehicles at all” and the Army </p>
<p>“knew that by spring 2007 we had to have something for them”.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> Gen Dannatt said that </p>
<p>the Vector programme was decided “in something of a hurry”.</p>
<p><b>538. </b> The procurement of the remaining 104 Vector vehicles, to bring the total to 166, </p>
<p>was progressed as part of Maj Gen Applegate’s response to the armoured vehicle </p>
<p>review in June 2006. That is addressed later in this Section.</p>

<p>284</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“This measure proved its worth as SAF [small arms fire] and RPG contacts also </p>

<p>armoured to provide protection against IEDs.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>547. </b> Lord Drayson responded that PPVs were:</p>
<p>“… only one of a range of vehicles available to commanders to allow them to </p>
<p>balance mobility, protection, and profile based on the threat, the terrain and the </p>
<p>task. PPVs offer a level of protection commensurate with their weight, size and role, </p>
<p>together with good mobility and a low profile.”</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Following a supplementary question from Lord Astor, stating that the Snatch </p>
<p>“was not remotely adequate for patrolling areas where insurgents used land mines” and </p>
<p>asking whether an assessment had been made of the RG31,</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> “which the Americans </p>
<p>had bought in large numbers”, Lord Drayson responded:</p>

<p><b>554. </b> Mr Browne met Mr Ingram and Lord Drayson to discuss the review on 27 June.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He asked Lord Drayson to:</p>
<p>“… set the necessary work in hand to provide Ministers with urgent, realistic, costed </p>
<p>advice on whether there is anything more we can do to protect troops … and to </p>
<p>enable them to achieve their mission(s). In particular, the review should examine </p>
<p>whether there are any vehicles with a higher level of protection than Snatch Land </p>
<p>Rovers which could be procured quickly (and if so, at what cost).”</p>
<p><b>555. </b> Maj Gen Applegate provided a paper to Lord Drayson on “the capability that might </p>
<p>be achieved with the investment of about £50m for the protection of soldiers in PPVs” </p>
<p>on 28 June.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> He recommended that Lord Drayson approve:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment of £2m for an “urgent study on options for an enhanced PPV”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the procurement of all 166 Vector vehicles for Afghanistan; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the purchase of additional armoured kits for FV430 for use in Iraq. The existing </p>
<p>UOR would begin to deliver up&#8209;armoured FV430s in October 2006 and </p>
<p>deliveries would be completed by January 2007.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Maj Gen Applegate advised Lord Drayson:</p>
<p>“PJHQ and LAND regard a broad systems approach to force protection as essential, </p>
<p>linking ISTAR, situational awareness, tactic techniques and procedures, ECM and </p>
<p>platform survivability. This systems approach seeks to defeat the system; if this fails </p>
<p>defeat [sic] the device, and finally defeat the attack.”</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Maj Gen Applegate highlighted that the UK had been criticised for not adopting </p>
<p>the RG31, variants of which were in service with US and Canadian forces and which </p>
<p>had been used by UK forces in the past. He wrote that RG31 had previously been </p>
<p>discounted as a suitable alternative to Snatch. Brig Moore would be briefed on its </p>
<p>development and growth potential when he visited South Africa on 29 June. </p>
<p><b>558. </b> In relation to the study into future PPV capability, Maj Gen Applegate wrote:</p>
<p>“The threat continues to develop and there is a requirement to assess urgently </p>
<p>how to sustain the PPV capability. The US is conducting a similar assessment. </p>
<p>New developments designed to meet this threat are currently at the demonstrator </p>
<p>stage and it would be prudent to examine these urgently to understand what </p>
<p>capabilities they might offer. In general if we are to combat the developing threat we </p>
<p>will require a heavier vehicle capable of carrying a higher payload in order to mount </p>
<p>additional armour. The ability of such a vehicle to operate effectively in the urban </p>
<p>environment will be part of the assessment.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>559. </b> Maj Gen Applegate recommended that additional funding be provided “to </p>
<p>develop concurrently an enhanced PPV capability to match the emerging threat, with </p>
<p>an anticipated fielding in the latter half of 2007”. In the interim, “and to provide the </p>
<p>commander with sufficient flexibility to mitigate the weakness of Snatch, additional </p>
<p>armour packs should be procured for FV430”. The possibility of accelerating the </p>
<p>modification of FV430 and Vector was also being explored.</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Lord Drayson approved the request the same day.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> He asked Maj Gen Applegate </p>
<p>to “engage with coalition partner to identify whether they may have excess PPV capacity </p>
<p>which would provide a greater level of protection which could be made available to the </p>
<p>UK”; and for further advice by 13 July.</p>
<p><b>561. </b> Following his visit to South Africa, Brig Moore advised on 3 July that, should </p>
<p>the Army decide that “a better protected PPV” was required, then the RG31 had “the </p>
<p>potential to meet that requirement”.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> In considering the requirement, Brig Moore wrote </p>
<p>that there was a “conundrum” between a heavier vehicle that was able to protect soldiers </p>
<p>against the mine or IED threat, and ensuring the vehicle was agile enough to access </p>
<p>built&#8209;up areas. He added that “if the UK wants to provide its soldiers with the protection </p>
<p>necessary to do their job, it will need a heavier PPV”.</p>
<p><b>562. </b> On RG31, Brig Moore stated:</p>
<p>“It is now apparent that RG31 … has sufficient stretch potential to take the additional </p>
<p>weight associated with protection against […]. In addition, LSSA [Land Systems </p>
<p>South Africa] has a rigorous testing regime … and this is fully compliant with DSTL </p>
<p>thinking. LSSA is innovative, front running and is at the leading edge of their trade. </p>
<p>Should the Army want a heavier and better protected PPV, RG31 would be a strong </p>
<p>contender.”</p>
<p><b>563. </b> In his summary, Brig Moore said that “the South Africans were open, engaging and </p>
<p>ready to help in any way possible. Notwithstanding the considerable attributes of RG31, </p>
<p>UK should exploit this opportunity.”</p>
<p><b>564. </b> In response to a question from the Inquiry, about whether he had asked about </p>
<p>potential alternatives to Snatch on the global market before June 2006, Lord Drayson </p>
<p>wrote in his statement:</p>
<p>“Yes … I was advised that there was no vehicle identified that could provide the </p>

<p>that the RG31 would be a strong contender should the Army want a heavier and </p>

<p>it was prepared to allocate funding to it was the key point. I pushed to try to make </p>

<p>Gen Dannatt was to take over as Chief of the General Staff in August. He wrote: </p>
<p>“The pace and changing dynamics in theatre have brought into sharp relief the </p>
<p>concerns that you and I have about support to current operations. In addition, </p>
<p>Ministers have recently faced difficult questions in the House. Given that there are </p>
<p>some important discussions in ECAB, Programme and Planning Strategy Group<b>, </b></p>
<p>and DMB in the next few days, I thought I should set out now very clearly my view </p>
<p>of the unacceptable areas of risk.” </p>
<p><b>566. </b> Gen Dannatt described four “major concerns as the Force provider”, protected </p>
<p>mobility and protected patrol vehicles being his “first and overriding concern”. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> Gen Dannatt wrote that the use of Vector, up&#8209;armoured FV430 and Warrior would </p>
<p>“provide a balanced capability” in the short term which could be “tailored to met the </p>
<p>different demands” of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was “accepted” that Vector </p>
<p>would not provide “full protection against all threats” but it would “increase survivability </p>
<p>compared with Snatch improved protection, greater mobility and larger capacity)” and </p>
<p>he believed that there was “no immediate or practicable alternative”.</p>
<p><b>568. </b> Gen Dannatt stated that there was therefore “an urgent need to complete the buy </p>
<p>of Vector now”. While plans in place meant that that “should achieve the immediate goal” </p>
<p>for Afghanistan, it would leave forces in Iraq with Snatch “for the foreseeable future”. </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“How the remainder of the PPV capability shortfall should best be addressed will </p>
<p>require further consideration. If a better PPV than Vector can be developed, and </p>
<p>delivered in the right timeframe, then clearly we should pursue this line. However, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>570. </b> On 4 July, Mr Browne sent Lord Drayson a note summarising a meeting they had </p>
<p>earlier that day to discuss PPVs.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> They agreed that Lord Drayson would pursue:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clear confirmation from military commanders that there was a requirement for </p>
<p>a medium weight armoured patrol vehicle as an alternative to Snatch or Tracked </p>
<p>Armoured Vehicles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>subject to that confirmation, a rapid investigation of options to deliver such a </p>
<p>capability as an interim solution (around 50&#8209;100 vehicles, although that would </p>
<p>need to be refined) whilst work continued on longer term solutions; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>subject to both points, deploying the vehicles alongside the forces due to be </p>
<p>deployed to Iraq in November 2006. </p>
<p><b>571. </b> Mr Browne reported that he had discussed funding with Mr Gordon Brown, </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer, following his meeting with Lord Drayson where it was </p>
<p>concluded that the MOD could initially use the UOR contingency of £30m to fund the </p>
<p>project; and that additional funds could be sought as required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>572. </b> On 5 July, Lord Drayson asked Lt Gen Houghton for clear confirmation, </p>
<p>“in consultation with Front Line Commands”, as to whether there was a requirement  </p>
<p>for a medium weight armoured patrol vehicle “as an alternative to use of Snatch or </p>
<p>Tracked Armoured Vehicles on current operations”.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>573. </b> Lt Gen Houghton provided that confirmation on 7 July, stating:</p>
<p>“I am clear that, in light of the increasingly sophisticated and potent asymmetric </p>
<p>threat that we now face, a requirement for a medium weight PPV, in addition to </p>
<p>the current and planned enhancements to light weight PPV and tracked armoured </p>
<p>vehicles exists …</p>
<p>“We need a medium weight PPV … to provide a significantly enhanced physical </p>
<p>protection against EFP IEDs and RPGs … to prosecute our missions successfully </p>
<p>without unnecessary casualties. Only a balanced force will give the operational </p>
<p>commander the optimum flexibility to meet the range of tasks based on an </p>
<p>assessment of threat and risk. The Frontline Commands share this assessment.”</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>574. </b> Lt Gen Houghton added that, as Lord Drayson was aware, physical protection was </p>
<p>“only part of a balanced systems approach to delivering a Force Protection capability”; </p>
<p>and that improvements to the ISTAR capability were “a key element in achieving the </p>
<p>overall protection that we need”. </p>

<p>95</p>
<p><b>575. </b> On the same day, Lord Drayson asked Maj Gen Applegate:</p>
<p>“… for advice … in consultation with CJO and Land by 1600 14 July setting out </p>
<p>the number of vehicles required to meet present operational commitments … [and] </p>
<p>project plans for delivering the requisite number of vehicles in time to deploy on </p>
<p>the next Iraq roulement in November 2006.”</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>576. </b> On 11 July, Mr Browne told the House of Commons Defence Committee that the </p>
<p>increased IED threat had “generated a set of circumstances” where, in his view, the </p>
<p>MOD needed “to look at whether there is a need for something between Snatch Land </p>
<p>Rovers as a form of land transport and the Warrior”.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> In ordering a review of the use of </p>
<p>the Snatch, he had “accepted in principle” the need “to see if we can identify resources </p>
<p>that can be procured and deployed in the timescale that would provide that [the required] </p>
<p>level of protection while we wait for other armoured options becoming available”.</p>
<p><b>577. </b> On 12 July, Brig Inshaw recommended that Maj Gen Applegate agree:</p>
<p>“Despite recent casualties, the requirement to operate PPVs on current operations </p>
<p>endures and may increase as Defence is likely to be required to conduct concurrent </p>
<p>… campaigns over the next 3&#8209;4 years.”</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>578. </b> Brig Inshaw advised that there was a requirement for a “balanced PPV capability”. </p>
<p>It should include a medium weight PPV, for which there was “an urgent requirement”, </p>
<p>and light, agile PPVs “such as Vector”, although “commanders recognise that such </p>
<p>a vehicle will never be protected against the most demanding threats”.</p>
<p><b>579. </b> Brig Inshaw advised that Brig Moore had examined “a number of options” that </p>
<p>were “either in development or in service elsewhere in the world”. Brig Inshaw wrote </p>
<p>that commanders accepted all of these could produce solutions that were “significantly </p>
<p>larger” or have “a more aggressive profile” than Snatch and Vector. It was accepted </p>
<p>that this was “a penalty” commanders would “have to pay for the improved levels of </p>
<p>protection”. Brig Inshaw added:</p>
<p>“To avoid confusion, it should be noted that PPVs will not deliver the capability or </p>
<p>overall protection levels we would expect of an in&#8209;service APC [Armoured Personnel </p>
<p>Carrier] (such as FV430 Mk 3) or of FRES, which will be designed to operate in </p>
<p>a less permissive environment (where issues surrounding size and posture are far </p>
<p>less important) and to defeat a significantly more demanding threat. A mixed fleet of </p>
<p>light and medium PPVs would allow commanders to force package appropriately to </p>
<p>the terrain and task.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>580. </b> In addition, Brig Inshaw wrote that there was “an urgent requirement for armoured </p>
<p>vehicles to provide protected transport to move personnel for administrative purposes” </p>
<p>because PPVs had “been used to fulfil this role” in the past. That would be addressed </p>
<p>by the deployment of FV430s in November 2006 and LAND was “deploying additional </p>
<p>up&#8209;armoured Warrior” vehicles to meet the requirement in “the very short term”. </p>
<p><b>581. </b> Brig Inshaw advised that improved physical protection was only part of the solution; </p>
<p>work was also under way to address battlefield helicopter and ISTAR shortfalls, and </p>
<p>TTPs would continue to be adapted. He noted that fielding a larger PPV would “require </p>
<p>some change to current operational practices”. </p>
<p><b>582. </b> Initial calculations highlighted a shortage of PPVs in Iraq, Afghanistan and the </p>
<p>training pool. Brig Inshaw wrote that the MOD was taking “some 30% risk in numbers </p>
<p>against the requirement” and that could worsen between 2007 and 2008 when Snatch </p>
<p>1.5 was removed from service. He suggested that 808 medium PPVs were needed </p>
<p>to meet the operational requirement, 510 of which would be for Iraq. He also advised </p>
<p>that all PPVs in Iraq should be medium weight (as opposed to a combination of light </p>
<p>and medium weight vehicles, which was the suggestion for Afghanistan). The planned </p>
<p>procurement of Vector and up&#8209;armouring of the FV430s should continue. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> On 13 July, Lord Drayson’s Assistant Private Secretary summarised a meeting </p>
<p>that had been held between Lord Drayson and Maj Gen Applegate that evening.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maj Gen Applegate had informed Lord Drayson that the requirement for 166 Vector and </p>
<p>additional armour packs for FV430 had been confirmed. Lord Drayson had confirmed </p>
<p>that the resources for those requirements “would not count against the new resources </p>
<p>being provided by the Treasury to meet the medium weight PPV requirement”. </p>
<p><b>584. </b> Maj Gen Applegate had advised Lord Drayson that 15 vehicles had been examined </p>
<p>and “the only option to borrow vehicles was 25&#8209;50 Bushmasters that Australia could </p>
<p>release” but there was no way of acquiring additional vehicles beyond this because </p>
<p>“there was no manufacturing line”. Two options were “worthy of further consideration”: </p>
<p>the Protector (a new variant of the RG31) and the Iraq Light Armoured Vehicle (ILAV) </p>
<p>(derived from the Cougar which was already being used by the US Marine Corps and </p>
<p>had survived around 1,000 IED attacks in Iraq). Both vehicles would meet the required </p>
<p>protection capabilities; the key for the MOD was which vehicle could be delivered </p>
<p>more quickly. The US was “willing to provide a couple of ILAV vehicles to the UK early </p>
<p>for testing”. </p>
<p><b>585. </b> Lord Drayson had suggested acquiring a number of both vehicles to reduce the </p>
<p>delivery time and Maj Gen Applegate undertook to investigate it further. There was </p>
<p>a discussion about “the difficulties posed” by Force Protection Inc being a new MOD </p>
<p>supplier. Two possible options had been identified for expediting matters: either acquiring </p>

<p><b>586. </b> Lord Drayson was grateful for the efforts which had been made and had stated </p>
<p>that the “pace of work must now be maintained”. He requested an update by 20 July, </p>
<p>including advice on how “to achieve the necessary commercial arrangement”. </p>
<p><b>587. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman visited Iraq from 9 to 13 July.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“On equipment, ISTAR and helicopters remain the key focus. Whilst clearly all </p>
<p>acknowledge the limitations of Snatch, feeling was not as strong … as I had </p>
<p>expected. Very striking was great confidence in ECM equipment … All I spoke to had </p>
<p>faith that this, coupled with rigorous execution of the now highly developed TTPs, </p>
<p>gave them confidence and a good level of protection. But they would welcome a </p>
<p>new PPV, though were clear that any vehicle would need to be able to access the </p>
<p>tight urban sprawl that characterises much of Basra – Vector, they felt, would take </p>
<p>the trick in this respect, but their point about utility in tight urban areas will need to </p>
<p>be taken into account in the Medium PPV work.” </p>
<p><b>588. </b> On 19 July, in the House of Commons, Mr Owen Paterson asked Mr Browne what </p>
<p>the performance specifications of the new Vector vehicle were and how its protection </p>
<p>levels compared to Snatch and the RG31.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> Mr Browne replied:</p>
<p>“The key performance requirements for Vector are improved mobility, payload and </p>
<p>capacity compared to Snatch. We do not comment on levels of armour protection …”</p>
<p><b>589. </b> The USUR for a medium weight PPV, for use in Iraq and Afghanistan, was </p>

<p>were personnel travelling in Snatch Land Rovers. </p>
<p><b>590. </b> The USUR stated: “The IED and RPG threats” in Iraq and Afghanistan “are here </p>
<p>and now; Snatch is both obsolete as a light weight PPV and the heightened EFP IED </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>591. </b> In explaining the justification for the requirement and the inadequacies of existing </p>
<p>equipment, the points made by Lt Gen Houghton included that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“EC advice suggests that we have reached the engineering and technological </p>
<p>limits of the physical protection that can be provided by Snatch and other light </p>
<p>weight PPVs.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ … Defence has a moral responsibility towards our servicemen to ensure we </p>
<p>have done everything that is reasonable to minimise loss to life and ensure </p>
<p>operational success; there is still some way to go before that assurance can </p>
<p>be offered.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ … [T]he public, political and media expectation is that military operations can </p>
<p>now be conducted without significant casualties”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A MPPV is needed in order to provide significantly enhanced physical protection </p>
<p>against IEDs (incl EFP) and RPGs … to prosecute the mission successfully </p>
<p>without unnecessary casualties.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Every effort should be made to enhance force protection measures – perversely </p>
<p>this may mean that as troop numbers go down, PPV numbers remain broadly </p>
<p>similar, thereby affording greater levels of protection to a larger part of the </p>
<p>deployed TELIC force.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ … [O]nly a balanced force will give the operational commander the optimum </p>
<p>flexibility to meet the range of tasks based on an assessment of threat and risk.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ … [H]elicopters are already in short supply and it is highly unlikely that </p>
<p>additional aircraft will be available to meet the increased demand without severe </p>
<p>impact on JHC [Joint Helicopter Command] ability to sustain the current and </p>
<p>emerging operational requirements.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Snatch is no longer fit for purpose as a light weight PPV and the increased </p>
<p>threat requires a MPPV.” </p>
<p><b>592. </b> When the Inquiry asked Lord Drayson why he had found it necessary to ask </p>
<p>Lt Gen Houghton for confirmation that there was a requirement for a medium weight </p>
<p>PPV, Lord Drayson wrote in his statement:</p>
<p>“It was necessary because I had become concerned about the growing casualties </p>
<p>to personnel travelling in Snatch from IEDs in Iraq. The military had identified </p>
<p>a requirement for a new light PPV for HERRICK (Afghanistan) which had been </p>
<p>approved via the core equipment programme by PJHQ in March 2006 (the Vector </p>
<p>vehicle) but no requirement had been identified for Iraq. I wrote to CJO to force the </p>
<p>issue. The push to procure a medium weight PPV in time for the Nov 06 roulement </p>
<p>of forces came from Ministers.”</p>

<p>99</p>
<p><b>593. </b> The Inquiry asked Lt Gen Fulton why he thought the push for a medium weight </p>
<p>PPV had to come from Lord Drayson instead of from the Defence Board or Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff:</p>
<p>“ … I think there’s a sort of relationship there between the commander on the ground </p>
<p>at whatever level, the commander in theatre, the Permanent Joint Headquarters, </p>
<p>the chiefs, the equipment customer and a series of examinations of what was </p>
<p>needed against what was … available in the sense of, you know, did it exist?</p>
<p>“I don’t think people were sitting on their hands saying, ‘It is all fine’. I think people </p>
<p>were saying, ‘this IED problem is a whole theatre problem …’”</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>594. </b> Lieutenant General Andrew Figgures, who succeeded Lt Gen Fulton as DCDS(EC) </p>
<p>in June 2006, told the Inquiry that the procurement of a medium weight PPV was not </p>
<p>possible before 2006 because there was not a vehicle that could meet the requirement:</p>
<p>“… my judgement would be that every waking hour people had they were attempting </p>
<p>to solve the problem in this area, but if there is no technical solution to it, however </p>
<p>much effort you put into it, you can’t solve it.”</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>595. </b> The Inquiry asked Lord Drayson why the military chain of command had not </p>
<p>identified the requirement earlier. He replied:</p>
<p>“I found it hard to understand why the military chain of command had not raised a </p>
<p>requirement for a medium weight PPV when it was clear that it was not technically </p>
<p>possible to procure a light weight PPV at that time with enough armour protection to </p>
<p>overmatch the IED then being used against our troops. The thinking of the military </p>
<p>throughout this period was that a small light weight vehicle of the size and weight of </p>
<p>Snatch was needed to patrol in the way the British Army operated in Iraq. I accepted </p>
<p>that buying a much bigger and better protected medium weight vehicle would not </p>
<p>be suitable for this type of patrolling in narrow streets but I believed that providing </p>
<p>commanders in theatre with the option of a bigger vehicle would allow them to </p>
<p>choose when and where to use it.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>597. </b> A business case for the procurement of 108 Cougar vehicles at an estimated cost </p>
<p>of £73.1m was submitted to the IAB on 20 July.</p>
<p>310</p>
<p> It was a joint case from the DEC(GM) </p>
<p>and SUV IPT teams. One company of vehicles would be delivered by November 2006 </p>
<p>and the remaining vehicles by April 2007. The total requirement was for 510 vehicles for </p>
<p>Iraq and 150 for Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>598. </b> The business case stated that a “significant proportion of IEDs are EFPs, which </p>
<p>have constantly changing initiation methods and are difficult to detect”.</p>
<p><b>599. </b> There were currently 380 Snatch vehicles in Iraq, against a theatre establishment </p>
<p>of 420:</p>
<p>“The Snatch PPV provide the deployed force with a level of manoeuvrability </p>
<p>and survivability in order to conduct operations, however, the rapidly evolving </p>
<p>asymmetric threat faced on Ops TELIC and HERRICK have overmatched the </p>
<p>capability envelope of the Snatch PPV. Moreover, the majority of Snatch deployed </p>
<p>on Op TELIC are the 1.5 variant which is due to go out of service from January </p>
<p>2007. With a host of obsolescence issues, Snatch is no longer capable of matching </p>
<p>the high level of threat faced in Iraq and Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>600. </b> The business case stated that there was “no specific operational analysis to </p>
<p>support the requirement” for a medium weight PPV but that it had been driven by the </p>
<p>“rapidly evolving threat”, namely EFPs. Work had been initiated by Brig Inshaw “to define </p>
<p>the longer term requirement to fulfil the future PPV capability”. </p>
<p><b>601. </b> The business case considered four options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To do the minimum: deploy additional assets “and/or” reallocate assets to </p>
<p>Op TELIC and Op HERRICK. In Iraq that was likely to mean more Warrior </p>
<p>vehicles were deployed but “the current high usage rates” were already having </p>
<p>a detrimental effect on the ability to sustain the Warrior fleet in the longer term. </p>
<p>That option had “been discounted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RG31: That solution was considered “immature” and had “been discounted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cougar 6x6: The preferred solution with “proven mine protection (in&#8209;service </p>
<p>US Army data)” and sufficient payload to mount armour necessary for better </p>
<p>protection.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>risk, the attached risk register said that there was “high level US military support for the </p>
<p>planned acquisition”. The business case proposed to adopt “a single source acquisition </p>
<p>strategy” that was based on “a world&#8209;wide market survey, paper technical assessment </p>
<p>and industrial visits to ascertain the most suitable and cost effective solution”.</p>
<p><b>603. </b> The business case stated that, although Cougar would provide a “significant </p>
<p>enhancement in survivability” over Snatch and Vector, it would still be defeated by </p>
<p>the most effective EFP and very large blast IEDs. It also highlighted that Cougar was </p>
<p>“a large platform with good cross country mobility but less agility and terrain accessibility </p>
<p>in the urban environment than Snatch and Vector”. It was reiterated that the chain of </p>
<p>command should understand and explain the strengths and limitations of the platform </p>
<p>to all potential users.</p>
<p><b>604. </b> On 20 July, Lord Drayson wrote to Mr Timms seeking his agreement for an </p>
<p>additional £89.2m of UOR funding to be found from the Reserve for Cougar vehicles and </p>
<p>FV430 vehicles.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> The £47.8m required for additional Vector vehicles for Afghanistan </p>
<p>could be found from within the Defence budget. </p>
<p><b>605. </b> Lord Drayson wrote that the review of protected vehicles announced by Mr Browne </p>
<p>on 26 June had “confirmed” there was a capability gap in Iraq and Afghanistan’s </p>
<p>protected vehicles. The “key threat in Iraq” was “now” the EFP IED. Warrior vehicles had </p>
<p>been up&#8209;armoured to help meet this threat but that had led to an “over&#8209;reliance” upon </p>
<p>it in theatre which meant that personnel in Warrior units were “significantly exceeding” </p>
<p>guidelines for operational tour intervals.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>606. </b> Lord Drayson stated that Snatch vehicles could not “be armoured sufficiently to </p>
<p>defeat the EFP IED or RPG threats”: “As the media and a number of politicians have </p>
<p>highlighted recently, there have been a significant number of deaths in Iraq from EFP </p>
<p>IED attacks on Snatch.”</p>
<p><b>607. </b> Lord Drayson said that, after “a very rapid evaluation” of “possible vehicles </p>
<p>available worldwide”, the Cougar variant was best placed to meet “both the time and </p>
<p>performance criteria”. He added:</p>
<p>“The fact that an early version is already in the UK service with Explosive Ordnance </p>
<p>Disposal troops and it is also in service with both the US Army and Marine Corps </p>
<p>gives us considerable confidence in it. We will be relying on the assistance of </p>
<p>the US Government and military to deliver it as rapidly as possible and this is an </p>
<p>excellent example of where the Special Relationship will have a direct impact on our </p>

<p><b>608. </b> Lord Drayson wrote that, given Mr Browne’s commitment to report back to </p>
<p>Parliament “as soon as possible” and the start of recess on 26 July, he would be grateful </p>
<p>for confirmation of the funding by the following day.</p>
<p><b>609. </b> Mr Timms replied to Lord Drayson on Sunday 23 July, saying he realised that </p>
<p>Mr Browne was “under pressure to make an announcement in the House on Monday” </p>
<p>and the “considerable work” undertaken by officials “in scoping the requirement” within </p>
<p>the tight deadline.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> Mr Timms wrote that he fully recognised the need to provide </p>
<p>“adequate protected mobility in these challenging environments” and that he supported </p>
<p>the proposals. </p>
<p><b>610. </b> While Mr Timms agreed that the MOD could enter into commercial arrangements </p>
<p>to up&#8209;armour the FV430s and procure Cougar vehicles, he was “not comfortable” that </p>
<p>the “commercial terms” had been reached for the requirements to be “properly costed”. </p>
<p>He asked for an update once the full costs were finalised, at which point he would </p>
<p>“formally uplift” the UOR funding.</p>
<p><b>The Cougar vehicle</b></p>
<p>The Cougar is described by the US Department of Defense as “a hardened engineering </p>
<p>vehicle that provides protection against armor&#8209;piercing rounds and high&#8209;explosive </p>
<p>devices”.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p> It is used for “ordnance disposal, communications, command and control, </p>
<p>and leading convoy missions”. It is available in two configurations: 4x4 and 6x6. </p>
<p>Both of these configurations have been integrated with UK systems to enable their use on </p>
<p>UK operations: the 4x4 became the Ridgback, and the 6x6 became the Mastiff. </p>
<p>The main distinction between the two is their size. The British Army refer to Mastiff as </p>
<p>Ridgback’s “bigger brother”.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p>The US Marine Corps contracted Force Protection Inc to provide 28 Cougar vehicles </p>
<p>in April 2004.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> Three further orders were placed by the US Army for Cougar vehicles </p>
<p>between May and June 2005, but for a Joint EOD Rapid Response Vehicle (JERRV) </p>
<p>variant. Those were in both configurations (4x4 and 6x6) and were delivered in 2005.</p>
<p>The JERRV variant was a type of vehicle also known as a Mine Protected Vehicle, or </p>
<p>more commonly a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (MRAP) which is specifically </p>
<p>designed to protect against landmine and IED attacks, making them suitable for Explosive </p>
<p>Ordnance Disposal tasks. </p>

<p><b>611. </b> In anticipation of his written statement on the armoured vehicle review, Mr Browne </p>
<p>was offered presentational advice on 21 July.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>612. </b> The advice stated that one of the key messages to convey was:</p>
<p>“With current vehicles, including Snatch (which will remain appropriate for some </p>
<p>tasks) this provides a coherent package of vehicles, offering a range of protection, </p>
<p>mobility and profile. Commanders will have a significantly increased choice of </p>
<p>vehicles to be used as they see fit to best meet the mission and counter the threat. </p>
<p>No one vehicle is appropriate for every task.</p>
<p>“It will be important to make clear that while we are confident that the Med[ium] </p>
<p>PPV being procured offers significantly greater protection against the key threats </p>
<p>in both Iraq and Afghanistan than the Snatch, as with any other vehicle, it cannot </p>
<p>be guaranteed to offer absolute protection …”</p>
<p><b>613. </b> According to the advice, the short timescales in which the medium PPV </p>
<p>programme had been developed meant that the usual “full testing” of the vehicle had not </p>
<p>been possible but the MOD was confident of its capability based on US use of the same </p>
<p>base vehicle in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>614. </b> The range of different vehicles would allow commanders “to balance protection </p>
<p>against the requirements of the mission”. Snatch was “still an appropriate vehicle for </p>
<p>some tasks” and the additional vehicles did not mean Snatch was “not used at all”.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> The advice recognised that the announcement marked a significant change of </p>
<p>direction. Answers to Parliamentary Questions in June had stated that the “requirement </p>
<p>was for small, light, highly mobile vehicle that could operate in urban areas and vehicles </p>
<p>such as RG31 and Cougar would not meet this requirement”. It added:</p>
<p>“At that time the ECC [Equipment Capability Customer] was considering whether </p>
<p>there was a long term answer to the need for a small, mobile but better protected </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>patrol vehicle … The review [announced on 26 June] established that there was no </p>
<p>small but better protected vehicle available now and the only immediate options for </p>
<p>better protection were vehicles such as Cougar.” </p>
<p><b>616. </b> The advice stated that the MOD “might be open to criticism” that it had only taken </p>
<p>action “when forced to by the media”. Draft briefing for Press Office included:</p>
<p>“<b>Q.  Why have you done this now, not a year ago?</b></p>
<p>“A.  As recent events have shown, the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan changes </p>
<p>rapidly and the threat is constantly evolving. In response, work was ongoing </p>
<p>within the department to examine options for the procurement of a medium </p>
<p>protected patrol vehicle. The review announced by the Secretary of State for </p>
<p>Defence on 26 June enabled the acceleration of this work including by securing </p>
<p>additional funding.”</p>
<p><b>617. </b> The advice also considered the potential question of why Cougar had not been </p>
<p>procured sooner, given that the US had been using it for “some time”. The suggested </p>
<p>response was that that was because the situation in the UK’s Area of Responsibility was </p>
<p>different to that of the US. </p>
<p><b>618. </b> The advice acknowledged that the UK had “some very early versions” of the </p>
<p>Cougar, such as the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) variant, which was </p>
<p>used for Explosive Ordnance Disposal tasks and deployed to Iraq in “2003&#8209;4”. It had </p>
<p>been bought in 2002 from Supacat Technical Solutions Group, a subsidiary of Force </p>
<p>Protection Inc. The advice said the MRAP vehicles were “very different” to the Cougar </p>
<p>vehicles being procured because the MRAP vehicle was not a patrol vehicle and would </p>
<p>not meet the UK’s requirements. It did not elaborate on any of those points.</p>
<p><b>619. </b> Mr Browne’s Written Ministerial Statement on 24 July said:</p>
<p>“It [the Armoured Vehicles Review] has confirmed that there is a growing </p>
<p>requirement for a protected vehicle with capabilities between our heavy armour, </p>
<p>such as Warrior, and lighter patrol vehicles, such as Snatch. The review has also </p>
<p>identified feasible options to address the gap in the short term. We have now </p>
<p>completed a very rapid assessment of those options and have identified three </p>
<p>complementary ways forward …”</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>620. </b> Mr Browne announced:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the purchase of an additional 100 Vector vehicles for Afghanistan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the up&#8209;armouring of a further 70 FV430s for Iraq by spring 2007, in addition </p>

<p><b>621. </b> Mr Browne concluded:</p>
<p>“The up&#8209;armoured FV430, the Cougar medium PPV, and Vector fill the requirements </p>
<p>for varying degrees of protection, mobility and profile … But I am confident that </p>
<p>together these vehicles provide commanders with the right range of options to deal </p>
<p>with the situations and threats they face.”</p>
<p><b>622. </b> The MOD IAB approved the Cougar business case on 25 July.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p> It warned:</p>
<p>“There is clear risk of cost and time growth given the focus on satisfying the </p>
<p>survivability requirement and the speed with which the case has been put together </p>
<p>… Due to the exceptional way in which this programme has been funded, it is </p>
<p>important that it is understood that there is no scope for cost growth. The Treasury </p>
<p>have indicated that they will pay no more than the stated cost of the vehicles … </p>
<p>Contrary to … the Business case it is not correct to assume that additional funding </p>
<p>will be available from the Department. Any cost growth must be contained within </p>
<p>the approved cost, if necessary by reducing numbers.” </p>
<p><b>623. </b> The IAB asked for a further note to be submitted following the examination of </p>
<p>Bushmaster vehicles “as soon as possible, and by Sep 06”. It should report the results </p>
<p>and, if necessary, seek the appropriate approval.</p>
<p><b>624. </b> On 5 August, the DIS produced a report on the EFP threat in MND(SE).</p>
<p>323</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“Since May 2005 the use of Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs) has become </p>
<p>increasingly common in MND(SE); 83 incidents have been reported with the monthly </p>
<p>number peaking at 12 in April 2006 … </p>
<p>“MND(SE) has a disproportionate number of EFP attacks in comparison to the rest </p>
<p>of Iraq … and they have accounted for […] IED related fatality in the region since the </p>
<p>end of May 2005.”</p>
<p><b>625. </b> The DIS concluded:</p>
<p>“The supply of EFPs in Iraq has recently increased with a four to five fold increase </p>
<p>in the number of EFPs in circulation for Apr to Jun 06 compared with the previous </p>
<p>three months … Recent incidents in MND(SE) have involved increasingly more </p>

<p>106</p>
<p><b>626. </b> In its report on UK operations in Iraq published on 10 August, the House of </p>
<p>Commons Defence Committee referred to its visit to Basra Palace in June: </p>
<p>“We heard that Snatch were very good vehicles, but they were old and could often </p>
<p>break down. Many had previously been used in Northern Ireland. They were fast and </p>
<p>manoeuvrable but not well armoured and were particularly vulnerable to IED attack. </p>
<p>Similar concerns were voiced by UK troops at the Shaibah Logistics Base.”</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>627. </b> The Committee stated:</p>
<p>“We are concerned at the increasingly sophisticated nature of the threat and </p>
<p>the consequent vulnerability of UK Forces travelling in Snatch Land Rovers. </p>
<p>We welcome the Secretary of State’s review of the use of Snatch vehicles in Iraq </p>
<p>and believe it is essential that this review be completed as quickly as possible. In the </p>
<p>long&#8209;term, FRES may offer a solution to the difficulties associated with the Snatch, </p>
<p>but its introduction is too far off to offer an answer to current operational needs in </p>
<p>Iraq. The MOD should consider an ‘off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf’ purchase as an immediate and </p>
<p>interim replacement for Snatch, even if it does not fulfil the long term capability </p>
<p>requirement. It is unsatisfactory that the lack of capability was not addressed </p>
<p>with greater urgency much earlier.”</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Gen Dannatt wrote to Mr Browne on 31 August:</p>
<p>“I wrote to my predecessor [Gen Jackson] in July expressing my concerns </p>
<p>about the levels of protection for our patrol vehicles, the shortage of intelligence </p>
<p>and surveillance capability, the pressure on helicopters … That said I am most </p>
<p>appreciative of Lord Drayson’s recent efforts on the vehicle issue, but we have </p>
<p>a deficit to make up and the threat/response cycle is very dynamic …”</p>
<p>325</p>
<p><b>629. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, whether there were any </p>
<p>requests for funding for armoured vehicles between 1997 and 2006, and if any concerns </p>
<p>were raised with him about Snatch Land Rovers.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p> Mr Brown said that the question of </p>
<p>expenditure in Iraq had to start from the “one fundamental truth” that “every request that </p>
<p>the military commanders made to us for equipment was answered. No request was ever </p>
<p>turned down.” </p>
<p><b>630. </b> With regards to Snatch vehicles, Mr Brown told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… the point at which the Ministry of Defence decided that, as a result of the change </p>
<p>in tactics by insurgents against them, that they wanted additional and other vehicles </p>
<p>to deal with the problems they faced in the Basra area, we immediately agreed with </p>
<p>the Ministry of Defence that they should have the money …</p>

<p>when and where they needed these new vehicles …” </p>
<p><b>631. </b> Sir Peter Spencer, the Chief of Defence Procurement from May 2003 to March </p>
<p>2007, told the Inquiry that he used to call regularly on the three single Service Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff, the Chief of the Defence Staff and the three Commanders in Chief and that: </p>
<p>“If there had been concerns about UORs, they would have been raised.”</p>

<p><b>632. </b> Sir Peter later observed:</p>
<p>“… if it had been a problem somebody would have come to me and said … Chiefs </p>

<p>let you know.”</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>633. </b> Several witnesses, in their evidence to the Inquiry, explained that hardening </p>
<p>vehicles was just one way of protecting troops and emphasised the importance of </p>
<p>tactics, techniques and procedures.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> Asked whether he had been concerned about the vulnerability of Snatch in Iraq, </p>
<p>ACM Stirrup replied: </p>
<p>“Very concerned. We wanted to get rid of Snatch outside the wire as quickly </p>
<p>as possible but you can’t get rid of it by using just a big, heavy vehicle … it is a </p>
<p>mistake to believe that simply by increasing the armour on a vehicle, you can defeat </p>
<p>an improvised explosive device. You have to take a broad spectrum approach. </p>
<p>You have to improve your detection of the devices … You have to provide as much </p>
<p>physical protection in terms of armour as is consistent with the mission … but, </p>
<p>crucially, you have … to attack the people who are doing this.”</p>

<p>“During my time as CJO we saw a gradual, although not dramatic rise in the </p>

<p>developing tactics, techniques and procedures to mitigate the threat … whilst at the </p>
<p>same time seeking improvements to equipment, particularly the introduction of new </p>
<p>electronic warfare equipment, additional vehicle armour and better body armour for </p>

<p>108</p>
<p><b>636. </b> Major General Jonathan Shaw, GOC MND(SE) from January 2007 to August 2007, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as a safe vehicle because if you look at … what protection </p>
<p>means, only a part of that … is actually the hardening of the vehicle itself. Most </p>
<p>protection is achieved by not being located or identified or targeted in the first place …</p>
<p>“… more heavy armoured vehicles were hit than Snatch … Snatch has come in for </p>
<p>a lot of criticism, but actually it was an extremely effective weapon, and the soldiers </p>
<p>really liked using it because, although it was risky, it avoided the damage [to roads </p>
<p>and streets].”</p>
<p>331</p>
<p><b>637. </b> For the PPV programme, Sir Peter Spencer told the Inquiry that Lord Drayson had </p>
<p>become “the catalyst” for moving it forward.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p> When asked if that was unusual, Sir Peter </p>
<p>replied that it was “a leadership issue for the top of the shop in defence”.</p>
<p><b>638. </b> The Inquiry asked ACM Torpy what direction he had provided about the appropriate </p>
<p>levels of risk. He responded:</p>
<p>“I honestly do not believe it is CJO’s role to be giving direction to the in theatre </p>
<p>commander as to the levels of risk he should be taking with his people … Clearly </p>
<p>we wanted to minimise risk to people, but recognising that we had a job to deliver </p>
<p>as well … So we would do the utmost we could possibly do in terms of providing </p>
<p>improvements in terms of capability … tactics and procedures, I have to say I left </p>
<p>very firmly to the GOC …”</p>

<p>So I would have hoped if there was concern about what they were seeing on the </p>
<p>ground that they would have put that in a visit report or come and tapped me on </p>
<p>the shoulder and said, ‘Torpy, why hasn’t this been addressed?’ and that never </p>
<p>happened.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>641. </b> Asked if he had discussed with Generals Jackson or Dannatt whether something </p>
<p>else was needed for Snatch or if he had ordered any review of Snatch, ACM Torpy said:</p>
<p>“There was work going on … Snatch had always been identified as a problem and </p>
<p>I was very aware of the work … going on in the equipment capability area and in the </p>
<p>Front Line Command to look at what alternatives there were. </p>
<p>“The message … of the equipment capability areas is that there is not another </p>
<p>vehicle on the market which can provide that sort of mobility which we could go out </p>
<p>and procure tomorrow … The Americans didn’t have anything. They were still using </p>
<p>Humvees … they were having similar problems …</p>
<p>“… from a PJHQ perspective … we rely on the expertise which is in the equipment </p>

<p><b>642. </b> The Inquiry asked ACM Torpy if he had received any requests for the provision of </p>
<p>a replacement for Snatch. He replied:</p>
<p>“No, not that I recall.”</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Snatch served a really useful purpose in built&#8209;up areas where it was not easy – </p>
<p>in some cases not even possible – to get more heavily armoured vehicles, so … </p>
<p>Snatch was not necessarily an unpopular vehicle … depending on what was </p>
<p>happening. But … I recall … there was a particularly nasty incident in Maysan, </p>
<p>where … soldiers … were killed and they were in Snatch Land Rovers and that was </p>
<p>IEDs, so it became obvious at that point that this vehicle was not optimised in any </p>

<p>“Yes, but there was an element of ‘You have got what you have got.’ So you might </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>645. </b> When asked by the Inquiry whether the need and subsequent requests for different </p>
<p>levels of armouring was a feature of his time as GOC, Lt Gen Dutton replied:</p>
<p>“It must have been, but I don’t actually sort of recall it now … we were certainly </p>
<p>aware that, once the EFP arrived – we either needed to move people more by air or </p>
<p>we needed different tactics, techniques and procedures or we needed more heavily </p>
<p>armoured vehicles.”</p>
<p><b>646. </b> The Inquiry asked Lord Drayson whether action to improve the effectiveness </p>
<p>of electronic countermeasures or the level of protection afforded by Snatch was </p>
<p>suggested to him when he took office in May 2005.</p>
<p>339</p>
<p> In a statement to the Inquiry </p>
<p>Lord Drayson wrote:</p>
<p>“The briefings at that time did not indicate that action was required on the </p>
<p>effectiveness of countermeasures against IEDs or the protection afforded by the </p>
<p>Snatch Land Rover … I was informed by the military advice that the Snatch was </p>
<p>essential to the UK’s style of operations in Iraq that required a small, light and highly </p>
<p>manoeuvrable vehicle to enable our troops to patrol in the narrow streets of Iraqi </p>
<p>towns. The view expressed by the military at that time was that a heavily armoured </p>
<p>tank like vehicle would not have been practical or consistent with the UK’s style </p>
<p>of patrolling ‘amongst the people’.”</p>
<p><b>647. </b> The Inquiry asked ACM Torpy whether the problem was that there was no </p>
<p>agreement on what an alternative vehicle should be able to do.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that different commanders had different views, but that was not the problem. The </p>
<p>problem was that “genuinely there was a lack of a product on the market” which could </p>
<p>replace Snatch.</p>
<p><b>648. </b> When asked if it was “ultimately pressure from Ministers” on the military chain </p>
<p>of command which had led to the acquisition of heavier patrol vehicles, ACM Torpy </p>
<p>replied that Lord Drayson had “created momentum for Mastiff to be introduced”, and </p>
<p>“provided leadership in the MOD to make sure something was delivered”. That provided </p>
<p>the in theatre commander with “another medium weight vehicle with a higher level </p>
<p>of protection”. There was “no doubt that Mastiff was welcomed by the people on the </p>
<p>ground” and that they “could undertake certain tasks”, but they “could not do what they </p>
<p>were doing with Snatch previously”.</p>
<p><b>649. </b> Asked why the pressure for a heavier vehicle had not come through the chain </p>
<p>of command, ACM Torpy added:</p>
<p>“I think there was always pressure from the … theatre … to the MOD. I think </p>
<p>the problem actually arises where you have an equipment programme which is </p>
<p>under&#8209;funded and a desire … on the one hand to make sure that the capabilities </p>

<p>going to do this’.”</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>650. </b> Asked whether he had been pushing for an alternative vehicle to Snatch for </p>
<p>deployment in Iraq, Gen Jackson told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“This is one of those areas where it can be very frustrating as a single service chief, </p>
<p>because you don’t have the chequebook and you don’t place the orders. At that </p>
<p>time we were somewhat – what is the word I seek – quaintly known as Customer </p>
<p>Two in the procurement construct, which says something about how the user was </p>
<p>regarded …”</p>
<p>342</p>
<p><b>651. </b> Gen Jackson added:</p>
<p>“… it leaves the single Services somewhat at arm’s length from the process of </p>
<p>acquiring equipment … we need something better to use than Snatch – you may </p>
<p>need something bigger … That’s the requirement from the user but it gets rather </p>
<p>tortuous: it’s a very arm’s length relationship and therefore a very frustrating one.”</p>
<p><b>652. </b> Gen Jackson stated that the Defence Procurement Agency wrote the </p>
<p>specifications; they were not handled by the service board and only in broad parameters </p>
<p>by the Equipment Capability staff. </p>
<p><b>653. </b> Responding to a comment from the Inquiry that General Kevin O’Donoghue, Chief </p>
<p>of Defence Logistics 2005 to 2007 and Chief of Defence Materiel 2007 to 2009, had said </p>
<p>Gen O’Donoghue only bought what the customer had requested, Gen Jackson replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, but who says ‘it must withstand an explosion of this size’? Who says ‘its </p>
<p>ground pressure must not be more than that’? Who says ‘it must not be more </p>
<p>than this weight’? That’s not the function of the Army Board. The Army Board </p>
<p>says ‘we want a vehicle that will do this’ without going into that sort of detailed </p>
<p>specification.”</p>
<p>343</p>
<p><b>654. </b> Asked specifically whether he had tried to push back against the processes he was </p>
<p>describing in relation to Snatch, Gen Jackson told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Yes, very much so. I have a recollection of what to me was a very important </p>
<p>meeting with the then Procurement Minister, Lord Drayson, because I just felt we </p>
<p>were not getting anywhere within the normal processes of the MOD, you know, and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>655. </b> In Gen Jackson’s view, Lord Drayson:</p>
<p>“… was able, using his ministerial authority, and to be fair his commercial </p>
<p>experience, to cut through some of the Gordian knots which seemed to surround </p>
<p>what otherwise was this complex process.”</p>
<p><b>656. </b> The Inquiry asked Gen Dannatt about Sir Peter Spencer’s comment that if the </p>
<p>Commanders in Chief had concerns about UORs they would have been raised, and </p>
<p>asked whether he was satisfied that the Army had had the equipment it needed to fight </p>
<p>in Iraq coming through the UOR process.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> Gen Dannatt replied:</p>
<p>“In general terms the answer is yes. There was a problem, though, which was … </p>
<p>that the process whereby the troops deployed on the front line saw a requirement </p>
<p>and reported it back to PJHQ, the action in the PJHQ and the staff there, which </p>
<p>were relatively small in number, were able to turn the opinion and the requirement </p>
<p>of soldiers on the ground into a rapidly staffed requirement for new and changed </p>
<p>equipment that could then be fired at the Defence Procurement Agency or whatever </p>
<p>it was at the time.</p>
<p>“I felt that there was a greater role that … Land Command, could have played to </p>
<p>help out at least the horse power of those on the equipment staff of PJHQ, and also </p>
<p>play our wider understanding of army requirements from our frequent involvements </p>
<p>informally with the troops on the front line. I thought we could actually get a greater </p>
<p>understanding, get it more quickly. I made several offers, and they were taken up </p>
<p>eventually, to have my own equipment staff help the PJHQ equipment staff to try to </p>
<p>convert the needs of the front line into identified requirements that the procurement </p>
<p>system could then get on and act upon.” </p>
<p><b>657. </b> Gen Dannatt added that he “was never convinced” that “we were actually doing </p>
<p>all we could be doing to make sure that we had the right equipment, in the right quantity </p>
<p>in … front line hands, as quickly as possible”; and that “there was a bit of deficiency in </p>
<p>leadership and energy at times”.</p>
<p><b>658. </b> When asked specifically about why it had taken so long to find a replacement </p>
<p>vehicle for Snatch, Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“All commanders have accepted there is the need to have a light patrol vehicle. </p>
<p>Narrow streets, small roadways and so on, that you have got a vehicle that can get </p>
<p>down these places.</p>
<p>“That has been used as a justification to keep the existing Snatch in small numbers </p>
<p>still in theatre for the present moment.</p>
<p>“Another line is … and I was strongly of this view, let’s get all the Snatch out as </p>
<p>quickly as we can, but if you accept there is a need for a light patrol vehicle, it was </p>
<p>345 </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>said by all those involved with industry and the procurement process that there </p>
<p>was nothing available on the market to replace the sort of Snatch&#8209;type dimension </p>
<p>very quickly. </p>
<p>“I think we have already … mentioned the fact that even now the Ministry of Defence </p>
<p>I understand is deliberating between two contenders for effectively a Snatch </p>
<p>replacement. This is 2010. That was 2003/4.”</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>659. </b> Gen Dannatt continued:</p>
<p>“… it was said by the people whose advice one had to take, ‘There is nothing else </p>
<p>out there’. I am not a scientist myself. If that’s what they say, one had to accept that.</p>
<p>“Therefore the next strand of argument was to really go for the work&#8209;arounds as </p>
<p>to how do we protect our people with other vehicles? That’s where we get into </p>
<p>the Mastiffs, the Bulldogs … Many of these have been very successful. Mastiff </p>
<p>very successful … In the context of Iraq something that I found counterintuitive </p>
<p>and had to agree to while I was Commander in Chief was the Bulldog. The old </p>
<p>430 lightly armoured personnel carrier that I grew up as a platoon commander </p>
<p>in the early 1970s and I thought had had its day in the battlefield. When I said, </p>
<p>‘We must have a better vehicle’, eventually they came to me in middle 2005 and </p>
<p>said, ‘Commander in Chief, the best option that we can get into the field quickly with </p>
<p>good protection is to slap modern armour around a re&#8209;engined 430 series vehicle. </p>
<p>That’s the best we can do’.</p>
<p>“I took a very deep breath and said, ‘If that’s the best we can do, then that’s what we </p>
<p>are going to do’. For Iraq I think it played a significant role.”</p>
<p><b>660. </b> When asked about the Ministerial review into PPVs in 2006, why it had taken </p>
<p>so long and why it was a political rather than a military initiative, Gen Dannatt told the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… it wasn’t money and was not industry capacity … I think it was a deficiency in </p>
<p>leadership and energy in solving this problem … but really frustrating not to be able </p>
<p>to get on with this, and the fact we have still not closed with the issue in 2010.”</p>
<p>347</p>
<p><b>661. </b> The Inquiry asked Gen Dannatt about where that lack of leadership and energy </p>
<p>resided. He replied:</p>
<p>“… if you were going to identify a requirement that needed resources thrown at it, </p>
<p>which couldn’t be funded immediately from the UOR process, it has to come from </p>
<p>somewhere else in the core MOD Equipment Programme. That meant something </p>
<p>else had to go and other people perhaps did not want to see other things they </p>
<p>thought were very important going.</p>

<p>person, I am not a scientist …”</p>
<p><b>662. </b> The Inquiry asked why the Mastiff programme had been initiated by Ministers </p>
<p>rather than the Defence Board providing the answers to what, by then, was recognised </p>
<p>every day in Iraq to be a serious problem.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> Gen Dannatt replied:</p>
<p>“I was purely a member of the Defence Board, and there were many people around </p>
<p>the table and many conflicting points of view. You can articulate your point of view as </p>
<p>clearly as you can. Others might be persuaded by your argument or choose not to </p>
<p>be persuaded by your argument. … In many cases they chose not to be persuaded </p>
<p>by my argument. So one had to accept the decisions that were taken, albeit with </p>
<p>a degree of frustration.”</p>
<p>CHANGES TO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR IDENTIFYING AND FUNDING UORS </p>
<p><b>663. </b> The earlier part of this Section, considering improvements in the MOD’s </p>
<p>procurement processes during Op TELIC, looks in more detail at the advice given by </p>
<p>Lt Gen Houghton in 2006 on how to improve the way in which capability gaps were </p>
<p>identified.</p>
<p><b>664. </b> At the same time, concern was growing about the MOD’s failure to control </p>
<p>expenditure on UORs for Iraq and Afghanistan, leading the Treasury to seek a new </p>
<p>arrangement for funding UORs. </p>
<p><b>665. </b> When ECAB discussed a review of the Equipment Programme on 5 July </p>
<p>2006, it was pointed out “that considerable work had been undertaken (including the </p>
<p>engagement of Ministers) on the PPV issue and protected mobility”, but there were </p>
<p>remaining concerns about: </p>
<p>“… the ability of the routine procurement process to react quickly enough to match </p>
<p>changing threats. The UOR process worked well at the start of a campaign, but was </p>
<p>not designed to support enduring operations.”</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>666. </b> On 24 November, Mr Browne wrote to Mr Timms to request an increase of £460m </p>
<p>in the combined UOR funding.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> Despite tight controls, the requirements for UORs </p>
<p>continued “at a rate higher than anticipated, and considerably above historical norms”, </p>
<p>because of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the intensity of operations in Afghanistan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the slow drawdown of forces from Iraq;</p>

<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the constantly evolving threat in both theatres; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a decreased willingness, at all levels, to ‘make do’ with sub&#8209;optimal solutions </p>
<p>and uncomfortable living and working conditions now that both operations </p>
<p>[Afghanistan and Iraq] have become enduring”.</p>
<p><b>667. </b> The size of the request prompted Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary to do </p>
<p>“a little digging” into the MOD’s UOR system.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> He reported to Mr Browne:</p>
<p>“The UOR system – the people who make bids on it and those who sanction </p>
<p>bids within it – are changing their attitude. There is greater willingness to ask for </p>
<p>technical solutions to reduce risk and discomfort and less inclination to block such </p>
<p>bids. Partly this is because there is a perception (rightly or wrongly) that the political </p>
<p>environment has changed, and money is no longer the constraint it was. Whilst it </p>
<p>never was for UORs/operations, many in the MOD became used to it as a constraint </p>
<p>in restructuring and that attitude bled across to other things …”</p>
<p><b>668. </b> Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary suggested a discussion of the UOR </p>
<p>culture that was forming, and “whether we need to re&#8209;steer a little or accept that this </p>
<p>is the new price of doing business”. </p>
<p><b>669. </b> The request on 24 November prompted a series of discussions between the </p>
<p>Treasury and the MOD about the adequacies of the UOR system. </p>
<p><b>670. </b> Mr Timms was advised by a Treasury official on 9 January 2007 that: </p>
<p>“At official level, MOD have indicated that the underlying reason for the sustained </p>
<p>high level of UORs is linked to a Ministerial judgement that soldiers must be </p>
<p>provided with the optimum equipment, especially where force protection is at stake. </p>
<p>“HMT [the Treasury] have never refused a request to fund a UOR. Once forces are </p>
<p>deployed and commanders are generating requirements it is difficult to deny the </p>
<p>resources … It follows that the mechanism for limiting the total cost of operations </p>
<p>is to resist any expansion of troops committed to operations, rather than UORs to </p>
<p>supply the troops already deployed in theatre.”</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Mr Timms was advised by a Treasury official on 20 April that the “step&#8209;change” </p>
<p>in the level of UOR funding made the current UOR arrangement “unsustainable”.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Treasury had provided £2.1bn to fund UORs relating to Iraq and Afghanistan since </p>
<p>2001, of which over half had been provided in the last two years:</p>
<p>“We [the Treasury] do not question the military judgment that there is a current </p>
<p>operational need – but we believe that many of these items seek to provide </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>a general capability that could have been provided through the Equipment </p>
<p>Programme. Many items appear to be kitting out the Army while the Equipment </p>
<p>Programme has invested in ships and aircraft … As such we think the UOR scheme </p>
<p>is becoming a straightforward supplement to the EP [Equipment Programme] in </p>
<p>a way that it was never intended to be, bailing out MOD of the need to prioritise </p>
<p>in the kit they purchase and compensating for bad decisions in the past.” </p>
<p><b>672. </b> The official advised that the UOR regime was not ideal for the UK military </p>
<p>either, as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>despite accelerated procurement, UORs were frequently not available until </p>
<p>several months after a need had been identified. It would be better to plan </p>
<p>to have the capability in advance; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that would also enable soldiers to be trained on new equipment before their </p>
<p>deployment to theatre, and for new equipment to be properly incorporated into </p>
<p>military doctrine; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>after one year, the ongoing costs of UORs reverted to the core defence budget. </p>
<p>Those unplanned costs could be difficult to accommodate. </p>
<p><b>673. </b> From June 2007, the process changed so that the Treasury cleared every UOR </p>
<p>individually (rather than only those above £10m).</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>674. </b> The outline of a new UOR regime was agreed in late July, as part of the MOD’s </p>
<p>settlement in the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Reserve would pay for the “first element” of total UOR costs each year;</p>

<p>118</p>
<p><b>684. </b> IED attacks in MND(SE) continued to cause casualties, with an increase in the </p>
<p>targeting of Warrior vehicles.</p>
<p><b>685. </b> On 28 December 2006, Sergeant Graham Hesketh was killed when the Warrior </p>
<p>vehicle in which he was patrolling hit a roadside IED in Basra City.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>686. </b> On 5 January 2007, PJHQ informed Mr Browne that a Warrior vehicle had been </p>
<p>penetrated by an IED attack on 27 December, resulting in seven minor casualties.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>687. </b> PJHQ said there had been an increasing number of larger EFPs used against MNF </p>
<p>vehicles over the last two months and, as a result, two further UORs to enhance the </p>
<p>Warrior’s armour had been submitted. A reserve pool of Warrior vehicles was maintained </p>
<p>to replace those damaged beyond repair in theatre.</p>
<p><b>688. </b> On 10 January, Mr Browne requested further advice on the nature of the advanced </p>
<p>armour, when it was likely to be fitted and any intelligence held on the increased threat.</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>689. </b> Private Michael Tench was killed on 21 January when his Warrior vehicle suffered </p>
<p>an IED attack while patrolling with three other Warrior vehicles.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> Four other soldiers </p>
<p>sustained injuries, one of which was very serious.</p>
<p><b>690. </b> PJHQ submitted further advice to Mr Browne on 26 January.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> It said that the </p>
<p>recent attacks were the first to penetrate the Warrior vehicles but, while the number </p>
<p>of EFP attacks had increased, “these large EFPs are not a new threat, as they were </p>
<p>first seen in MND(SE) in Jul 05”. Six Warriors had sustained serious damage since </p>
<p>1 November 2006. </p>
<p><b>691. </b> PJHQ assessed that the increased targeting of Warrior was likely to be a result </p>
<p>of their increased use in road convoys (due to the reduction in the use of Snatch Land </p>
<p>Rovers). The two UORs for enhanced armour were predicted to be in service by the end </p>
<p>of April. </p>

<p><b>694. </b> Lord Drayson visited Iraq on 8 March and discussed various equipment issues </p>
<p>in theatre, including force protection.</p>
<p>368</p>
<p> The report of his visit stated that “the overall </p>
<p>opinion” on Mastiff and Bulldog “seemed to be positive” although there were some </p>
<p>performance issues and suggestions for improvement. With Mastiff, there were </p>
<p>“a number of minor issues” that “could be easily solved” with a visit from IPT. Those </p>
<p>included: a lack of servicing schedule or handbook; radio batteries not generating </p>
<p>sufficient power for good communications; and air conditioning units not adequately </p>
<p>cooling the ECM, creating a risk of overheating. The “most significant concern” was </p>
<p>that “the vehicle would be a victim of its own success”; there had been cases of visitors </p>
<p>“insisting on travelling in Mastiff, relegating them to VIP taxis rather than the patrol tasks </p>
<p>they were bought to fulfil”. Lord Drayson “made it clear that they should not be abused </p>
<p>in this way”.</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Lord Drayson was told that there were “many problems” with the Snatch 2 platform. </p>
<p>The Snatch 2A was “a lot more reliable than the Snatch 2” but needed modifications to </p>
<p>improve night vision and communications equipment.</p>
<p><b>696. </b> The visit report highlighted that Mastiff was too large for use inside Basra City. </p>
<p>There were some areas where Bulldog was also too large to go and Snatch was </p>
<p>deployed because the threat of IED attacks in those areas was “minimal”. The US </p>
<p>was using less protected vehicles, Humvees, for that role but “protected them through </p>
<p>aircover”. The report stated: </p>
<p>“Given the scientific limits on the amount of armour that could be applied to a vehicle </p>
<p>the size of Snatch, any vehicle used to carry out tasks in confined urban areas was </p>
<p>inevitably going to be at risk – but it was safer than carrying out the tasks by foot, </p>
<p>or by helicopter.”</p>
<p><b>697. </b> Lord Drayson was told:</p>
<p>“Overall there was a clear perception in theatre that UK MOD was not taking account </p>
<p>of the rate of change. UORs too often sought to deliver a perfect capability, but in </p>
<p>doing so delivered so late the requirement had changed or theatre were without any </p>
<p>capability for too long. It was suggested that if there were greater dialogue between </p>
<p>theatre and the ECC/ABW [Equipment Capability Customer/Abbey Wood</p>
<p>369</p>
<p>] on </p>
<p>individual UORs then trades … could be made.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>698. </b> The report concluded by saying that “the lack of faith in the UOR process” and </p>
<p>the suggestion of a “fundamental mismatch” between theatre’s requirements and the </p>
<p>“ECC/IPTs endeavours to deliver the perfect capability in a more extended timeframe </p>
<p>was concerning”. Lord Drayson asked for advice, by 10 April, from Maj Gen Figgures </p>
<p>on how to address that and for him and the Chief of Defence Materiel “to reinforce the </p>
<p>urgency that everyone should attach to delivering UORs”.</p>
<p><b>699. </b> In his evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee on 20 March about </p>
<p>UK operations in Afghanistan, Lt Gen Houghton said that the deployment of Mastiff and </p>
<p>Vector was expected to be complete by the end of autumn.</p>
<p>370</p>
<p> He said that, by that time, </p>
<p>all Snatch vehicles would have been removed from theatre. </p>
<p><b>700. </b> On 18 May, Lord Drayson was advised that a total of 49 operational Mastiff </p>
<p>vehicles out of 108 had been delivered so far: 14 in Iraq, 16 in Afghanistan and 19 </p>
<p>in the UK.</p>
<p>371</p>
<p><b>Capacity to improve the UOR system</b></p>
<p>Following Lord Drayson’s request for advice on how to address the “fundamental </p>
<p>mismatch” between theatre’s requirements and the delivery of capability, Lt Gen Figgures </p>
<p>advised on 4 April that the UOR process continued to be “agile and reactive, with an </p>
<p>average of just seven months between the PJHQ endorsement of a requirement and the </p>
<p>in&#8209;service date of the UOR&#8209;ed equipment”.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> Those seven months included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identification of a solution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the drafting and approval of a business case;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the placing of a contract;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the manufacture and/or integration of the equipment; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the delivery of that equipment to theatre.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Figgures acknowledged the rise in USURs during FY 2006/07 and stated that </p>
<p>“the more heavily loaded” teams, the Departments of Equipment Capability (DECs) and </p>
<p>Directorate of Capabilities Resources and Scrutiny (DCRS), had augmented their staff </p>
<p>“so as to be able to continue to react rapidly to the increase in volume and not slow the </p>
<p>process down”.</p>
<p>Time was “the key driver for UORs” and it was “universally accepted” that UORs only had </p>
<p>to meet “an 80+ percent solution”, on the basis that it was “preferable to rapidly fill the </p>
<p>capability gap that exists in theatre rather than achieve a technically perfect outcome”.</p>
<p>Considering potential reasons for delay, Lt Gen Figgures wrote that there had been </p>
<p>“a gradual evolution” in the type of UORs being submitted over recent months from </p>
<p>“traditional” UORs that sought to modify or enhance existing equipment to UORs </p>
<p>“asking for entirely new systems” which inevitably would take longer to deliver.</p>

<p>121</p>
<p>Lt Gen Figgures added that perceived delays could also potentially be attributed to </p>
<p>optimism bias and the six&#8209;month duration of rotations, the latter meaning that some </p>
<p>personnel might not stay in theatre long enough to see equipment enhancements arrive </p>
<p>during their tour.</p>
<p>On communications between the UK and theatre, Lt Gen Figgures advised that PJHQ </p>
<p>remained “in constant <i>daily </i>contact” with Equipment Capability (EC) cells in theatre. </p>
<p>The DECs were also “in frequent dialogue” with the EC cells. There had been various </p>
<p>visits from teams engaged in the procurement chain and those would continue in balance </p>
<p>with theatre’s priorities. </p>
<p>Recognising that some improvements could be made, Air Commodore Brian Bates, </p>
<p>Director Directorate of Joint Capability, and Mr Guy Lester, Director DCRS, were </p>
<p>going to join PJHQ’s monthly video conference calls with theatre as of that month. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Figgures concluded:</p>
<p>“Indeed, this already regular dialogue with theatre made the concerns expressed to </p>
<p>the Minister all the more surprising as reports from theatre on UORs tend to be very </p>
<p>positive.”</p>
<p>On 23 April, Lord Drayson met Lt Gen Houghton and Lt Gen Figgures “to discuss </p>
<p>the apparent discrepancy between the view of troops in theatre and PJHQ/MOD on </p>
<p>equipment and UORs”.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> VAdm Style sent a note of the meeting to Lord Drayson on </p>
<p>21 May after consulting with PJHQ and EC cells.</p>
<p>VAdm Style reported that the average length of UOR delivery time had fallen over the </p>
<p>last three years from an average of 9.3 months to 7.5 months. A “longer term analysis” </p>
<p>indicated delivery times at the start of Op TELIC were shorter, taking 5 months in 2002 </p>
<p>and 3.1 months in 2003, but it was felt that “reflected the simpler nature of the UORs </p>
<p>processed”.</p>
<p>VAdm Style wrote that the overall feedback on UORs remained “very positive” with </p>
<p>“94 percent/100 percent” of Op TELIC and Op HERRICK UORs being rated as effective </p>
<p>or highly effective. </p>
<p>The recent comments about perceived failures in the UOR process were “a source of </p>
<p>concern”. VAdm Style suggested several ways to address the “causal factors” for those </p>
<p>comments:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a review of pre&#8209;deployment UOR training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>better communication of what had been done and what was being done;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clearer flow of information from theatre because direct communication between </p>
<p>theatre and the Equipment Capability Customer (ECC) was “still the exception rather </p>
<p>than the rule”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assessing staff shortfalls in “key” Integrated Project Team (IPT) posts; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>374</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To improve the communication flow with theatre, DEC desk officers had been encouraged </p>

<p>and the manufacturer”. The USMC held “considerable influence” over Force Protection </p>
<p>Inc’s production “as it accounts for a significant proportion of the manufacturer’s </p>
<p>order book”.</p>
<p><b>721. </b> DCRS advised that the MOD’s request for additional Mastiff vehicles would be </p>
<p>considered at the next US Joint Chiefs of Staff on 11 October. Without its approval, </p>
<p>Force Protection Inc was unable to make any commitment to the MOD.</p>
<p><b>722. </b> On presentational advice, DCRS stated that “any attempt to directly influence </p>
<p>the US Congressional process would be unhelpful and so an announcement” should </p>
<p>be “considered carefully”. It added that an announcement would, “however”, offer </p>
<p>“significant advantages” because it “would illustrate the Department’s intent to </p>
<p>procure additional protected mobility vehicles, in order to improve force protection </p>
<p>and operational effectiveness”.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> The UOR for an additional 147 Mastiff vehicles for Afghanistan was submitted to </p>
<p>the IAB by DEC(GM) and the Specialist Utility Vehicle IPT on 4 October.</p>
<p>393</p>
<p> That would </p>
<p>increase the total Mastiff fleet to 280: 76 for Iraq and 204 for Afghanistan. Of Iraq’s 76 </p>
<p>vehicle allocation, 54 would be deployed (including eight ambulances) and there would </p>
<p>be 22 vehicles in the training fleet (including two ambulances).</p>
<p><b>724. </b> The UOR stated that an additional 26 vehicles were to be deployed “to the user” </p>
<p>by 31 April 2008. That would meet Iraq’s requirement but would leave Afghanistan with </p>
<p>insufficient vehicles “to meet the operational, training and maintenance requirements”. </p>
<p>There were currently 49 Mastiff vehicles available in Iraq, with 18 vehicles in the UK in </p>
<p>a training pool shared with operations in Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>725. </b> While it had been “originally envisaged that Vector would be suitable to </p>
<p>provide the bulk of the protected mobility” in Afghanistan, it was “now clear that the </p>
<p>situation, threat, mission and nature of operations demand[ed] a different capability”. </p>
<p>A “comprehensive review of protected mobility” in Afghanistan had shown that “the </p>
<p>capabilities required for the bulk of the combat troops are best met by a combination of </p>
<p>ATV(P) Viking and Mastiff”.</p>
<p><b>726. </b> The UOR stated that Mastiff was “now essential to operations on Op TELIC”. </p>
<p>It was “the most appropriate vehicle for long distance convoy escort operations where </p>
<p>movement is canalised on the main supply routes” between the Contingent Operating </p>
<p>Base and Kuwait, where logistic elements were based. It was “not possible” to draw </p>
<p>down Iraq’s Mastiff fleet to support Afghanistan without an impact on operations. </p>
<p>It added: “The shortfall in ambulances with commensurate protection and mobility </p>
<p>is constraining commanders (or forcing them to take risk).”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p> </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION OF A NEW PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL </p>
<p>OF RISK IN OPERATIONS</p>
<p><b>728. </b> In September 2007, the DOC reported on its “extensive review and analysis of the </p>
<p>UK’s current Force Protection (FP) capability in order to expose risk, provide assurance </p>
<p>and present strategic recommendations to COS [Chiefs of Staff]”.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>729. </b> The review was not specific to Iraq or Afghanistan but drew heavily on the UK’s </p>
<p>experience there. The review focused on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>risk and governance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the application of theatre entry standards;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lines of communication;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>protection in the land, air and maritime environments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>operational level protection; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UOR procured equipment. </p>
<p><b>730. </b> The review stated:</p>
<p>“Before undertaking an operation, COS should collectively reach a judgement on </p>
<p>sensitivities, likely benefits and consequences as well as the appetite – amongst </p>
<p>public, politicians and ministers – for sustaining casualties and prosecuting </p>
<p>operations that carried a certain degree of risk. This risk/benefit analysis would be </p>
<p>articulated and reviewed through the Strategic Estimate process. Any guidance </p>
<p>would have to be balanced to ensure that it was not overly prescriptive … or, </p>
<p>conversely, too generic …” </p>
<p>“… The management of FP risk must be based on a thorough identification of </p>
<p>strategic and operational threats to ensure that a balance of research, investment </p>
<p>and training is achieved commensurate with the threat … </p>
<p>“In deriving an assessment of cumulative risk, PJHQ should have a clear </p>
<p>understanding of the totality of known risk in the forces declared to it. This should </p>
<p>include all the equipment and other limitations which were accepted in the </p>
<p>procurement of force elements; all the subsequent limitations evident in practice </p>
<p>together with manpower, training or logistic support issues. If this risk capture </p>
<p>process works efficiently, CJO will be able to form an accurate judgment of the risk </p>
<p>to the protection of UK forces, which in turn would allow him to engage on palliative </p>
<p>measures required early in the operational planning process.”</p>

<p><b>731. </b> One of the points the Chiefs of Staff were asked to note was that, while the UK had </p>
<p>“a first class capability to neutralise and mitigate the IED threat”, “significant continued </p>
<p>investment” was necessary “to keep pace” with its rapid development. The review </p>
<p>stated: “Physical protection levels against the more capable anti&#8209;armour IEDs are, </p>
<p>however, probably approaching engineering and material limits.”</p>
<p><b>732. </b> On protected mobility, the review stated: </p>
<p>“The commander needs a range of protected vehicles to provide different levels of </p>
<p>protection and mobility depending on the specific operation. This includes the need </p>
<p>to operate in urban areas where larger, tracked vehicles may not be able to enter.”</p>
<p><b>733. </b> The review stated that, while the Snatch Land Rovers had been upgraded, they </p>
<p>were “still very vulnerable to roadside bombs and RPG”.</p>
<p><b>734. </b> The review stated that “the need for a replacement wheeled protected vehicle </p>
<p>was previously identified and Vector … PPV was procured with money being pulled </p>
<p>forward from the programme that already sat within the EP. Vector delivers increased </p>
<p>protection and greater capacity in comparison to Snatch and a total of 166 vehicles </p>
<p>have been procured.” There were 34 vehicles in Afghanistan and 22 in the training fleet; </p>
<p>the remaining 110 were due to be delivered by 31 October 2007. </p>
<p><b>735. </b> The review also referred to Mastiff’s rapid procurement and said that early reports </p>
<p>suggested it was “performing well”. </p>
<p><b>736. </b> There was “still no clearly defined Theatre Entry Standard for minimum levels </p>
<p>of protection and equipment that must be fitted to all vehicles” and that “an overall </p>
<p>assessment of the protection levels” would be “appropriate”.</p>
<p><b>737. </b> The Chiefs of Staff endorsed the recommendations on 26 September, including </p>
<p>the need to understand and articulate the level of risk that was acceptable on any </p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>738. </b> As a result of the DOC audit, the MOD produced a force protection policy in </p>
<p>November 2007.</p>
<p>397</p>
<p> It stated: </p>
<p>“The central tenet of this Force Protection (FP) policy is that the application of FP </p>
<p>measures to achieve a tolerable level of risk … enables, rather than constrains, </p>
<p>our freedom of manoeuvre.”</p>
<p><b>739. </b> In the policy document, the MOD mandated “the employment of a standard risk </p>
<p>methodology across all activities to ensure a common approach to the implementation </p>
<p>of FP [Force Protection] measures”. Oversight across the department would be achieved </p>
<p>through an FP Co&#8209;ordinating Committee (FPCC) chaired by Air Commodore Brian Bates, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>Director Directorate of Joint Capability. The committee, with the DECs, would ensure </p>
<p>that FP development was “coherent across the DLODs [Defence Lines of Developments] </p>
<p>and prioritised in accordance with current and future vulnerabilities”.</p>
<p><b>740. </b> The risk management process was laid out as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Identify. </b>The key to efficient risk management is the identification of adversary, </p>
<p>natural and human threats to the Force, which, if not tempered, would </p>
<p>otherwise impact upon mission success. That includes the anticipation of </p>
<p>increasing and emergent threats, particularly where it may take time to develop </p>
<p>countermeasures.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Assess</b>” – assessing the probability and impact of the identified threats on </p>
<p>mission success.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Address.</b> Resource constraints inevitably mean that Defence cannot protect </p>
<p>against all threats at all times in all circumstances.” That meant that investment </p>
<p>in capabilities had to be prioritised. It added: “Where a lack of resources or </p>
<p>mitigation activity could impact adversely on mission success, commanders </p>
<p>must communicate, through the chain of command, the need to review the </p>
<p>risk level.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Review. </b>Staff and commanders must manage risk proactively by monitoring the </p>
<p>risk profile, assessing the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures and reporting </p>
<p>upwards FP shortfalls or unavoidable risk issues.”</p>
<p><b>741. </b> Although the policy did not refer specifically to Theatre Entry Standards for </p>
<p>minimum levels of protection, it did identify the leads for a comprehensive range of force </p>
<p>protection elements, and what their considerations should be.</p>
<p><b>742. </b> The policy lead for platform protection was the Directorate of Joint Capability </p>
<p>but responsibility for its capabilities was spread across the relevant DECs and was </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinated on behalf of DCDS(EC) through the Joint Capabilities Board. It said:</p>
<p>“Procurement staffs must balance key user requirements and forecast operational </p>
<p>exigencies against current and future threats to deliver the appropriate degree </p>
<p>of platform protection … Operational staffs must risk manage the employment </p>
<p>of platforms according to the threat and the level of tolerable risk.”</p>
<p><b>743. </b> The policy said that the Joint Commander</p>
<p>398</p>
<p> owned the operational risk for forces </p>
<p>under his command. The CDS was responsible for articulating the risk for specific </p>
<p>operations and the Defence Secretary owned the risk inherent in the activities of the </p>
<p>Armed Forces on behalf of the Government.</p>
<p><b>744. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that the latest iteration of the force protection policy, </p>
<p>dated 21 May 2015, “defines risk ownership and governance more clearly than </p>

<p>399</p>
<p> The MOD said this had been integrated into wider MOD risk </p>
<p>management processes which had also been revised.</p>
<p><b>745. </b> The MOD said that the Operational Commander (which for Iraq was the CJO), </p>
<p>is accountable to CDS for understanding, quantifying and reducing risk to the force and </p>
<p>mission respectively. This risk response may require changes to activities or capabilities.</p>
<p>THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN “URBAN” PPV</p>
<p><b>746. </b> Fatalities in Afghanistan meant the continued use of Snatch Land Rovers remained </p>
<p>the subject of media and political debate.</p>
<p><b>747. </b> Baroness Taylor of Bolton became the Minister of State for Defence Equipment </p>
<p>and Support in November 2007.</p>
<p><b>748. </b> On 22 April 2008, a junior officer from DCRS advised Mr Browne that the </p>
<p>requirement for light PPVs was likely to continue in Afghanistan, albeit at a reduced </p>
<p>level, and with the introduction of more heavy and medium PPV variants.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p> The advice </p>
<p>had been prompted by a series of fatalities on Op HERRICK where personnel had been </p>
<p>travelling in General Service Land Rovers; vehicles that offered less protection than </p>
<p>Snatch Land Rovers.</p>
<p><b>749. </b> While operations in Iraq were not addressed in the note, the junior officer did </p>
<p>cover broader protected mobility issues and “the constant need to balance protection </p>
<p>against mobility”: “A range of vehicles, with different protection and mobility capabilities </p>
<p>is required.” The choice of vehicles available to commanders had been increased </p>
<p>significantly, and the delivery of more Mastiff, combined with the introduction of </p>
<p>Ridgback, would “harden” the Op HERRICK force considerably.</p>
<p><b>750. </b> A summary of the UK’s current and planned PPV range was provided in an </p>
<p>annex, where the Mastiff was described as a “heavy” PPV as opposed to the “medium” </p>
<p>Ridgback, and “light” Vector and Snatch vehicles. It stated that the Force Protection Inc’s </p>
<p>Cougar vehicle, the 4x4 variant, had been selected as the model for the Ridgback in </p>
<p>December 2007. Its expected interim operating capability date was October 2008.</p>
<p><b>751. </b> On Baroness Taylor’s copy of the minute, her Assistant Private Secretary had </p>
<p>written: “This useful note … has been triggered by Matt Cavanagh [Special Adviser to </p>
<p>Mr Brown] who wants to see zero use/casualties of Snatch …”</p>
<p>401</p>
<p><b>752. </b> In April 2008, the UK began to deploy Military Training Teams (MiTTs) alongside </p>
<p>the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). The roles of those teams and the rationale behind them </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>753. </b> In his weekly report on 17 April, Major General Barney White&#8209;Spunner, GOC </p>
<p>MND(SE) from February 2008 to August 2008, wrote that one of the lessons learned </p>
<p>about “MiTTing” was that the MiTT teams “must have the same mobility as their Iraqi </p>
<p>partners”.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p> Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner said that AFVs were perceived as “too aggressive </p>
<p>(by both the Iraqi leadership and by Basrawis)” and whilst the Mastiff had a reduced </p>
<p>profile, it was “still too large” to manoeuvre around “a complex urban environment”. </p>
<p>He described it as “an elephant compared to the Humvees of the US and Iraqis”.</p>
<p><b>754. </b> Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner wrote that “the mobility challenges presented by Mastiff” </p>
<p>also increased the risk of it being “vulnerable to attack”. He concluded: “There is an </p>
<p>urgent requirement to consider if there are protected mobility vehicles that might best </p>
<p>suit this task, although we are now clear that the solution is not Humvees.”</p>
<p><b>755. </b> On 20 April, the EC Branch in MND(SE) submitted a USUR for an “urban” PPV </p>
<p>that provided better manoeuvrability around Basra City than what was possible with the </p>
<p>existing, larger PPVs.</p>
<p>403</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>756. </b> The USUR stated that both Warrior and Bulldog were considered to be unsuitable </p>
<p>because tracked vehicles were unable to operate in urban areas. There was a concern </p>
<p>that Bulldog would “be considered as a tank” and affect the local perception about the </p>
<p>nature of the tasks being undertaken. </p>
<p><b>757. </b> The USUR described Mastiff as being used “through necessity, not choice” </p>
<p>because of restrictions on Warrior and Snatch. Mastiff’s size, kerb weight and </p>
<p>manoeuvrability made it unsafe in urban areas. Snatch was assessed as providing </p>
<p>insufficient force protection. </p>
<p><b>758. </b> On Snatch the USUR said:</p>
<p>“There would be political concern associated with the use of SN2A [Snatch 2A] in </p>
<p>the city. SN2A was withdrawn from use in the city in 2006 due to the high rate of </p>
<p>fatalities when vehicles were attacked. The equipment is not suitable for the task </p>
<p>in its current form and is not considered further.” </p>
<p><b>759. </b> The EC Branch identified the Cougar Ridgback as its preferred solution; US MiTTs </p>
<p>were using the US version of the Ridgback, the Cougar 4x4, and “generally” did not </p>
<p>have any problems accessing Iraqi Army units within the city. It also had good levels </p>
<p>of protection and some commonality with the Mastiff.</p>
<p><b>760. </b> In reviewing the potential vehicle solutions, the EC Branch said that the Australian </p>
<p>Bushmaster had good protection and mobility comparable with the Ridgback but </p>
<p>required “another Foreign Sales agreement”, had no commonality with the Mastiff and </p>
<p>the Australian fleet was being withdrawn in June 2008.</p>

<p><b>761. </b> On 29 April, Lieutenant General Peter Wall, DCDS(C), briefed the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>that the protected mobility options for the MiTTs in Basra “had been investigated and </p>
<p>Bulldog had been determined as the most applicable solution”.</p>
<p>404</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>762. </b> The minutes do not record that that was said to be the best option in the interim, </p>
<p>but the documents that follow suggest that Bulldog was only ever intended to be </p>
<p>a short&#8209;term solution until Ridgback came into service at the end of 2008.</p>
<p><b>763. </b> In his weekly report, on 2 May 2008, Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner stated:</p>
<p>“The provision of suitable vehicles for the remaining MiTTs is going to be a tricky </p>
<p>one and we are grateful for all the hard work being done in the UK to find a solution. </p>
<p>We have accepted … that we will have to manage with Mastiff and Bulldog in the </p>
<p>short term, and at least until Ridgback becomes available later in the year. This </p>
<p>is not ideal, as you know; Mastiff, as well as being in short supply, are having </p>
<p>considerable difficulty keeping pace with IA [Iraqi Army] Humvees through narrow </p>
<p>obstructed streets and Bulldog, being tracked, will be unpopular with both the Iraqi </p>
<p>chain of command and … with the Baswaris. </p>
<p>“I understand that Ridgback simply cannot be delivered in the required timeframe </p>
<p>even if diverted from their original target in Afghanistan, and my point is simply to </p>
<p>emphasise the urgency of procuring them as fast as possible. In the meantime, </p>
<p>we can make up some of our Mastiff shortfall for MiTTs if we are prepared to replace </p>
<p>some of those Mastiff on less vulnerable tasks (such as in Umm Qasr) with Vector, </p>
<p>which we understand are readily available in the UK.”</p>

<p><b>764. </b> Ministers continued to take a close interest in the provision of protected mobility </p>
<p>for deployed forces.</p>
<p><b>765. </b> On 6 May, the Chiefs of Staff were told that Vector would be used from the UK </p>

<p>the MiTTs.</p>
<p>406</p>
<p> Options for the use of Ridgback in the longer term were being investigated.</p>
<p><b>766. </b> On 22 May, a junior official advised Mr Browne that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s PPV requirement for “comprehensive MiTTing” was 60 vehicles. </p>
<p>Mastiff was “the most appropriate vehicle” to fulfil the task, of which MND(SE) </p>
<p>had 51 employed across a range of tasks and 43 could be re&#8209;allocated to </p>
<p>MiTTing.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Chiefs of Staff had endorsed military advice that, in order to make the </p>
<p>43 vehicles available, Mastiff vehicles operating elsewhere in Iraq would be </p>
<p>replaced with Vector, “at manageable risk to personnel on those tasks”. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The shortfall of 17 vehicles would be met by Bulldog in the short term “to provide </p>
<p>the best protection available”, although this could “have a negative effect on </p>
<p>Baswaris and ISF consent”.</p>
<p>407</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>767. </b> The junior official’s advice recognised that re&#8209;allocating Mastiff vehicles to </p>
<p>MiTTing would “inevitably incur greater risk elsewhere” but that PJHQ and GOC </p>
<p>MND(SE) considered that “to be acceptable”. The use of Vector vehicles would </p>
<p>be restricted to lower threat areas where the risk was “manageable” and would be </p>
<p>subject to “a continuous MND(SE) intelligence&#8209;based threat assessment” based on </p>
<p>Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner’s recommendation.</p>
<p><b>768. </b> The advice recognised that the decision to deploy Vector would reduce the number </p>
<p>of vehicles in Afghanistan’s regeneration pool but that was seen as “manageable in the </p>
<p>short term”.</p>
<p>408</p>
<p> If the consent for using Bulldog vehicles in the MiTT role deteriorated </p>
<p>“to an unacceptable level”, Mastiff vehicles planned for Afghanistan could be diverted </p>
<p>to Iraq, albeit creating a delay of one to two months for Mastiff vehicles to reach </p>
<p>Afghanistan. The impact of using Bulldog vehicles in a MiTT role would be assessed </p>
<p>at the end of July.</p>
<p><b>769. </b> Mr Browne was advised that industry could not produce “an adequately protected </p>
<p>vehicle” in less than six to nine months. Ridgback vehicles were being procured </p>
<p>for Afghanistan but the earliest those could be deployed was “early 2009” and the </p>
<p>provisional timeline for completing MiTTing in Iraq was May 2009 (see Section 12.1). </p>
<p>DCRS had advised that the Treasury was “most unlikely to fund a new vehicle or </p>
<p>modifications to existing vehicles” given the timelines.</p>
<p><b>770. </b> On presentation, the junior official warned that as Vector was “originally procured </p>
<p>to meet a lesser threat” in Afghanistan, it had “considerably lower levels of ballistic </p>
<p>protection than either Mastiff or Bulldog”. That potentially meant that “accusations could </p>
<p>be levelled” that Vector was “providing unacceptably low levels of protection to UK </p>
<p>forces”. A handling plan was being developed to address that.</p>
<p><b>771. </b> On the same day, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary replied to an MOD official, stating </p>
<p>that Mr Browne had discussed the note with HQ MND(SE) and was “not clear” that </p>
<p>Maj Gen White&#8209;Spunner’s intent on the use of Vector was “indeed as set out”.</p>

<p><b>773. </b> On 23 May, an MOD official submitted revised advice to Mr Browne, reducing </p>

<p><b>775. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner explained to the Inquiry that the difficulty of using Mastiff </p>
<p>vehicles for a MiTT role was:</p>
<p>“… for MiTT to really work well, it wants to always be slightly unobtrusive … and we </p>
<p>had large protective vehicles because of the dangers we had been facing …”</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>776. </b> Lt Gen White&#8209;Spunner commented that a vehicle which balanced protection needs </p>
<p>with the desired military profile was not possible: “Industry just can’t do this, they are not </p>
<p>in the showroom.” He added:</p>
<p>“So we had to use the Mastiff vehicles, which … is an excellent vehicle … it is just </p>
<p>slightly large for going down the more delicate bits of the Hanaya.”</p>

<p>urban areas in Helmand province, however much we would like it to.”</p>
<p><b>780. </b> Mr Ainsworth said that he was “aware of some of the opinions about Snatch” </p>
<p>but that he had received military advice that Snatch vehicles were still necessary. </p>
<p>Mr Ainsworth was also challenged by Mr Mike Penning, who argued that commanders </p>
<p>could only use what vehicles they have available. </p>
<p><b>781. </b> Mr Ainsworth said that commanders were provided “with a range of vehicles” </p>
<p>that allowed them “to select the platform most suited to the immediate task in hand”. </p>
<p>Protected mobility requirements were kept “under review” and that was why Mr Brown </p>
<p>had announced the procurement of Ridgback. </p>
<p><b>782. </b> On 25 June, Mr Browne called a meeting with senior military figures and Baroness </p>
<p>Taylor “at short notice” to “discuss future plans for the protected vehicle fleet, particularly </p>
<p>in Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>415</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>783. </b> While the meeting had “in part been prompted” by the recent Snatch fatalities, </p>
<p>Mr Browne “recognised that the issue ran wider” and there were vulnerabilities </p>
<p>associated with other patrol vehicles such as Vector that “were stories waiting to </p>
<p>happen”. </p>
<p><b>784. </b> Mr Browne had:</p>
<p>“… made clear his intent: namely, to deliver as quickly as possible a balanced and </p>
<p>sustainable protected vehicle capability in Afghanistan, with all patrol vehicles … </p>
<p>mine&#8209;protected, commensurate with their weight. This might infer [sic] the removal </p>
<p>from theatre of Snatch, Vector, Pinzgauer and GS Land Rover.”</p>
<p><b>785. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, who had become Chief of the Defence Staff in </p>
<p>April 2006, said that they “needed to start” by understanding the operational requirement </p>
<p>for lighter vehicles in Afghanistan and Iraq, and what the impact would be if PPVs with a </p>
<p>lower weight and protection level than Ridgback were no longer used. </p>
<p><b>786. </b> Sir Jock said that if a light PPV was “mission critical, whether to secure access, </p>
<p>increase flexibility or avoid the corrosion of popular consent, then the second question </p>
<p>was whether Snatch was the best vehicle available on the market to fulfil any of that </p>
<p>requirement”. If it was, then they “could collectively stand behind its continued use;  </p>
<p>if not, it should be replaced”.</p>
<p><b>787. </b> It was agreed at the meeting that “all vehicles had their vulnerabilities” but: </p>
<p>“ … if we were able to demonstrate that we had replaced, or had clear plans to </p>

<p>men and women that vehicle vulnerabilities are being addressed.” </p>
<p><b>788. </b> A discussion followed about the options for replacing the current fleet of light </p>
<p>armoured and unarmoured vehicles “in full” and it was agreed that those should be </p>
<p>pursued. The deployment of Ridgback into theatre was “Ministers’ first priority”.</p>
<p><b>789. </b> Mr Browne “emphasised the need for a clear and coherent public narrative” </p>
<p>about what had been achieved and what was being done “to enhance the robustness” </p>
<p>of the PPV fleet. He asked for a Written Ministerial Statement to be produced before </p>
<p>Parliament rose for the recess on 22 July.</p>
<p><b>790. </b> A Written Ministerial Statement on protected mobility was not made until </p>
<p>29 October 2008.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>791. </b> Mr John Hutton, who had succeeded Mr Browne as Defence Secretary earlier </p>
<p>in October, stated:</p>
<p>“We have already achieved a great deal in improving the protected mobility options </p>
<p>available to commanders on operations. Mastiff is unquestionably a success story. </p>
<p>For its role, Mastiff is delivering the very highest levels of protection available </p>
<p>anywhere in the world. Where it can be used, and its size and weight mean it has </p>
<p>its limitations, it is clearly the vehicle of choice. That is why the Prime Minister </p>
<p>announced a further order of these vehicles last year …</p>
<p>“It is not only through Mastiff that we are delivering a world class protected vehicle </p>
<p>capability; we are also delivering Ridgback. Using the smaller Cougar 4x4 chassis, </p>
<p>and innovative, cutting&#8209;edge UK armour technologies, we will be able to deliver </p>
<p>protection levels close to that of Mastiff in a package that is able to better access </p>
<p>urban areas, increasing the survivability of troops in these roles …”</p>
<p><b>792. </b> On Snatch Land Rovers, Mr Hutton said:</p>
<p>“Inevitably, any statement on protected mobility must address the role of the </p>
<p>Snatch Land Rover, a vehicle which has received considerable criticism. First, to </p>
<p>be absolutely clear, I can inform the House that – in addition to the regular reviews </p>
<p>that are conducted into protected mobility – senior operational commanders were </p>
<p>asked to specifically consider the requirement for the Snatch Land Rover and its </p>
<p>importance to operations. The response was clear: commanders need a vehicle of </p>
<p>the size, weight and profile of Snatch Land Rover, capable of transporting men, to </p>
<p>fulfil their tasks in theatre. Further, the availability of such a vehicle is considered </p>
<p>mission critical …”</p>
<p><b>793. </b> Mr Hutton said that that did not mean there was “no action” to be taken on Snatch. </p>

<p>Ridgback and the Snatch vehicle would continue to be modified, although, as with any </p>
<p>vehicle, it could never be made “invulnerable”. </p>
<p><b>794. </b> The latest variant, the Snatch Vixen,</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> had been especially configured for </p>
<p>Afghanistan, and the MOD had “already fielded a small number of these vehicles”.</p>
<p><b>795. </b> On 7 November, Lt Gen Houghton advised Sir Jock Stirrup on “an urgent review </p>
<p>of the impact of limiting the use of all variants of Snatch Land Rover”.</p>
<p>418</p>
<p> The advice </p>
<p>suggested that Lt Gen Houghton had issued separate, earlier advice in July to Sir Jock </p>
<p>following the meeting with Mr Browne on 25 June and the 7 November advice was </p>
<p>because he had been asked again to consider the impact of limiting the use of all </p>
<p>variants of Snatch in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>796. </b> Lt Gen Houghton wrote that the justification for retaining Snatch had not changed </p>
<p>since his previous advice in July; Snatch vehicles remained “mission critical” in both </p>
<p>theatres due to their profile, manoeuvrability and carrying capacity.</p>
<p><b>797. </b> Lt Gen Houghton said that limiting the use of Snatch outside secure bases in </p>
<p>Iraq would have a “significant impact” on operations by reducing patrols’ situational </p>
<p>awareness and restricting movements.</p>
<p><b>798. </b> The “interim solution” of Snatch Vixen in Afghanistan had “started to deliver”. </p>
<p>DEC(GM) was “working towards a final solution” but there was no light PPV “on the </p>
<p>market that could be delivered within a year”. The Ridgback and Mastiff programmes </p>
<p>for Afghanistan had been delayed and were not now likely to be delivered until the </p>
<p>beginning of 2009.</p>
<p><b>799. </b> Lt Gen Houghton added:</p>
<p>“Given the wider political and media sensitivity, however, we should maintain our </p>
<p>intent to deliver the planned SN2A [Snatch 2A variant currently in use] replacement </p>
<p>as quickly as possible, increase the numbers of PM [Protected Mobility] vehicles </p>
<p>in UORs and conduct rapid work on operational solutions to remove SN2A from </p>
<p>outside secure bases as quickly as possible. SN3&#8209;Vixen would appear to be the </p>
<p>fastest way of achieving this.”</p>
<p><b>800. </b> Major General Andrew Salmon, GOC MND(SE) from August 2008 to March 2009, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that, when he arrived in Iraq, “security was getting better”.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p> The number </p>
<p>of rocket attacks “was down to about four or five a month”, compared with over 200 a </p>
<p>month before the Charge of the Knights (see Section 12.1). There were still IEDs set on </p>

<p><b>801. </b> Maj Gen Salmon wrote in his post&#8209;tour report:</p>
<p>“The determination of the most appropriate mobility platform for any environment </p>
<p>requires a delicate balance between speed, manoeuvrability, firepower and </p>
<p>protection. Presentational constraints over the employment of Snatch were well </p>
<p>understood and acknowledged. Nonetheless, while offering good protection, Mastiff </p>
<p>generated other risks: heightened profile; regular collateral damage (with associated </p>
<p>cost to local approval) while manoeuvring in tight confines; and an inability to keep </p>
<p>up with ISF HMMVs [Iraqi Security Forces’ Humvees] in the City. This was set in </p>
<p>the context of CG MNF&#8209;I’s (Gen Petraeus) determination that troops should ‘get out </p>
<p>and walk’ – in order to influence the population directly. The solution was found in </p>
<p>a command decision to strip MiTTs down to the bare minimum and travel with Iraqi </p>
<p>counterparts in ISF in Iraqi vehicles. The ability to mentor improved immediately and </p>
<p>markedly and the level of protection afforded by ISF paintwork arguably exceeds </p>
<p>that of CF protective technology. It worked well.”</p>
<p>420</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>802. </b> Maj Gen Salmon said that that was a “defining decision” for building relationships </p>
<p>but that “the UK political sensitivities over any trade off between protection and </p>
<p>manoeuvre should not be underestimated”. He added: “Strategic risk aversion over </p>
<p>casualties was a real planning consideration that routinely shaped tactical operations.”</p>
<p>FRES AS A DISTINCT REQUIREMENT</p>
<p><b>803. </b> On 23 July, a note about FRES highlighted the capability gap that would remain </p>
<p>until FRES was delivered: </p>
<p>“PPVs do have some utility … but not in areas where they are likely to have to </p>
<p>operate within the range of enemy medium or heavy forces. PPVs do not meet the </p>
<p>protection, capacity, or tactical mobility requirements of FRES as a whole, although </p>
<p>it is possible that they could meet part of the requirement in the FRES BCU [Basic </p>
<p>Capability Utility] family …”</p>
<p>421</p>
<p><b>804. </b> The note added: </p>
<p>“Current operations show that we need to use a combination of armoured vehicles </p>
<p>… and PPVs … to operate in different roles, in different areas, to meet different </p>
<p>circumstances. However, PPVs are particularly important at the moment because, </p>
<p>in many cases, we have to use them where we would use FRES if it were available. </p>
<p>Therefore if FRES was in service now we would need to deploy fewer PPVs.”</p>

<p>422</p>
<p> It asked the Government to set out how the acquisition of Mastiff vehicles </p>
<p>for Iraq and Afghanistan had impacted on the FRES requirement.</p>
<p><b>806. </b> In response, the MOD stated that there was “no impact on the FRES programme </p>
<p>resulting from the procurement of Mastiff”.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p> The department had “a coherent two track </p>
<p>approach” to AFVs which made “a clear distinction between the urgent, short term need </p>
<p>for Protected Patrol Vehicles, such as Mastiff, designed for peace support operations” </p>
<p>and AFVs needed to “provide an effective FRES capability across the full spectrum of </p>
<p>future operations”. The MOD stated that Vector and Mastiff were designed to address </p>
<p>the risks faced by service personnel in the short term; FRES was always seen as a </p>
<p>longer&#8209;term requirement. </p>
<p><b>807. </b> Sir Peter Spencer told the Inquiry that there had been a difficulty in specifying a </p>
<p>requirement for PPVs as the threat developed; and that “one of the major problems the </p>
<p>Army had had for over a decade was deciding what it wanted its new fleet of armoured </p>
<p>fighting vehicles to be”.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p><b>808. </b> When asked about the procurement strategy for PPVs, Sir Peter referred to the </p>
<p>FRES programme: “ … a hugely ambitious programme which was never going to be </p>
<p>delivered in this decade … There were very difficult requirements stated for mobility and </p>
<p>protection and weight.”</p>
<p>425</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>809. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir Peter whether the issues with FRES had made it harder </p>
<p>to deal with PPVs. He replied:</p>
<p>“… the difficulty became in the amounts of money which were available and if you </p>
<p>were going to use money from the capital equipment programme to deal with the </p>
<p>short term … then that had a fratricidal effect on your ability to move the FRES </p>
<p>programme forward.”</p>
<p>426</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>810. </b> Lt Gen Fulton told the Inquiry that FRES and the replacement for Snatch were </p>
<p>“two completely different questions”.</p>
<p>427</p>
<p> He said that “to put something in” to the Defence </p>
<p>programme, “something ha[d] to come out”; the resources had to be balanced out. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fulton did not think that created a reluctance to give a Snatch replacement </p>

<p><b>811. </b> Lt Gen Figgures told the Inquiry that “FRES had been used as a regulator for </p>
<p>the defence programme. Money had actually been taken out of the FRES programme </p>
<p>in order to attempt to balance the programme.”</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>812. </b> Mr Hutton told the Inquiry that, if it had gone ahead on the original timescale, some </p>
<p>of the equipment from FRES would have been available for deployment in Iraq.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p><b>813. </b> In Mr Hutton’s view, the problem had been:</p>
<p>“We couldn’t settle on the specification. We changed our mind about certain aspects </p>
<p>of how we wanted to go ahead with the procurement. We started, we stopped.” </p>
<p><b>814. </b> ACM Stirrup told the Inquiry that the FRES programme was “overcomplicated and </p>
<p>overcomplex”.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p> He said that the “critical battleground” was the need to “interact with </p>
<p>the population”. That required “smaller and lighter vehicles”; “commanders need a wide </p>
<p>range of vehicles”. FRES “would not have solved the problems that we had been facing </p>
<p>in Iraq and Afghanistan, with, perhaps, one exception, which is the Scout variant … our </p>
<p>top priority at the moment … to replace the CVR(T)”.</p>
<p><b>815. </b> Gen Jackson told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“As the situation deteriorated in southern Iraq of course the vulnerabilities of the </p>
<p>Snatch Land Rover became tragically more and more apparent, and we then enter  </p>
<p>a difficult and muddled story as to the replacement, or the addition of better protected </p>
<p>vehicles into the deployed army’s inventory, and the whole FRES story comes into </p>
<p>this as well.</p>
<p>“… there is a limit to the amount of metal you can stick on a vehicle … and the ability </p>
<p>of the opposition to up the kinetic energy that can be applied can go rather faster </p>
<p>than our ability to withstand that. So the amount of metal on a vehicle is important </p>
<p>but it is not the complete answer, and you would finish up with a vehicle which is far </p>
<p>too large often to go down small streets in an urban area. So again the picture is not </p>
<p>black and white, and there is not some sort of fence you can jump over and all of a </p>
<p>sudden you have a vehicle which is immune to whatever your opponents may try </p>
<p>to do.”</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>816. </b> Gen Dannatt suggested to the Inquiry that FRES had been delayed by the MOD so </p>
<p>that funding originally allocated in the Equipment Programme for the FRES in 2007&#8209;2009 </p>
<p>could be used for other priorities.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>817. </b> Gen Dannatt referred the Inquiry to the ECAB meeting in January 2006</p>
<p>433</p>
<p> where </p>
<p>the Board was informed that there would be further delays to the FRES programme: </p>
<p>“What we decided to do was to persuade Lord Drayson, then the Defence </p>
<p>Procurement Minister, that we had a major problem, and it was decided to lay on </p>
<p>equipment demonstration on Salisbury Plain and get him to come and see it on the </p>
<p>basis seeing is believing, and then come to Headquarters Land and discuss the </p>
<p>issues. As Commander in Chief I was given the task to put that together.</p>
<p>“We took one of everything that we had and Lord Drayson saw what we had and </p>
<p>saw what we didn’t have and quite clearly what we didn’t have was anything in that </p>
<p>medium bracket … on the one hand we had these good heavy equipments, on the </p>
<p>other hand some good light equipments. In the middle we had nothing.</p>
<p>“In the car on the way back from Salisbury Plain to Headquarters Land he said to </p>
<p>me, ‘I didn’t know the army had a problem. Since I have become Minister of Defence </p>
<p>Procurement I have been focusing on jets and on aircraft carriers. I didn’t realise </p>
<p>the army had a problem’. To his great credit he then realised we had a problem and </p>
<p>began to put some leadership and energy into it.”</p>
<p>434</p>
<p><b>818. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that FRES was the programme “that was interesting the </p>
<p>military the most”, but his understanding was that “even if it had been carried out in full”, </p>
<p>it would “not have given us the right vehicles … for Iraq”.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p><b>819. </b> The Inquiry asked Lord Drayson about the concerns about FRES expressed by </p>
<p>Generals Jackson and Dannatt, and the relationship between progress on FRES and </p>
<p>concerns about Snatch.</p>
<p>436</p>
<p> Lord Drayson replied:</p>
<p>“The FRES project had become delayed, partly because the experience on </p>
<p>operations … led to repeated changes to the specification, and partly because the </p>
<p>user requirement had become much too complicated … </p>
<p>“The project to improve/replace Snatch was always separate … The Generals </p>
<p>stressed the urgent need to replace the ageing fleet of Army Fighting Vehicles as a </p>
<p>whole when voicing their concerns over delays to FRES … Snatch was a Protected </p>
<p>Patrol Vehicle rather than an AFV … In terms of augmenting Protected Patrol </p>
<p>Vehicles such as Snatch the focus in early 2006 for the Army was … Vector which </p>
<p>in March 2006 I was told was General Dannatt’s highest priority … </p>
<p>“Progress on FRES and concerns about Snatch should not have been connected </p>
<p>in theory … In reality however, I believe the Army’s difficulty in deciding upon a </p>
<p>433 </p>
<p>Gen Dannatt’s evidence during his public hearing was that this meeting was in 2005. Based on the </p>
<p>papers provided, the Inquiry has concluded this must have been an error in his recollection.</p>

<p>141</p>
<p>replacement to Snatch was in part caused by their concern over the likelihood of </p>
<p>FRES budgets being cut to fund a Snatch replacement vehicle.</p>
<p>“The impression I gained was the delivery of FRES by 2012 was a higher priority  </p>
<p>for the Army than finding funding for Snatch from the core equipment budget.  </p>
<p>I was concerned that the Army were focusing on the Vector … for Afghanistan and </p>
<p>upgrading the FV430 (Bulldog) and that no requirement had been identified for </p>
<p>a new medium weight protected patrol vehicle.</p>
<p>“The push to replace Snatch or to procure a new medium weight PPV so that </p>
<p>commanders would not have to use Snatch came from Ministers, not the military …”</p>
<p><b>820. </b> General Sir Michael Walker, CDS from 2003 to 2006, told the Inquiry that there </p>
<p>was no difficulty in securing funding for Iraq UORs but that the spending round in 2004 </p>
<p>threatened longer&#8209;term “big ticket items”.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> He said that there was “a list of stuff” where </p>
<p>decisions had to be made but he could not recall what was included.</p>
<p><b>821. </b> Gen Walker told the Inquiry that the procurement process for the FRES </p>
<p>programme had been “horrid” and a “sorry saga of debates and delays; delays because </p>
<p>of the lack of money”:</p>
<p>“… it was not as advanced as many other projects, it seemed to me to get delayed </p>
<p>and delayed and delayed, time after time, because the funding, and … if we had </p>
<p>gone with it originally, we might well have saved ourselves quite a lot of pain and </p>
<p>agony and death by having a vehicle that we could have used in the appropriate </p>
<p>circumstances in places like Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>438</p>
<p><b>822. </b> Lord Drayson was explicit that the decision to fund the Mastiff programme as </p>
<p>a UOR had been an important factor in reaching agreement on the requirement for </p>
<p>a medium weight PPV:</p>
<p>“There was concern that the FRES programme would be delayed or lose resources </p>
<p>as a result of buying a new vehicle. Ministers ensured that the funding … came from </p>
<p>a new UOR funded separately by the Treasury thus ensuring that the purchase … </p>
<p>had no detrimental impact on the FRES project.”</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>823. </b> Lord Drayson wrote that there was resistance from within the MOD to </p>
<p>reprioritisation of the core Equipment Programme to support current operations:</p>
<p>“… because the Services were concerned that their long term programmes would </p>
<p>be cannibalised and lose funding to short term operational needs … it was quite </p>
<p>unusual for core equipment funding to be redirected to operational needs. This only </p>
<p>happened when the military had a strong desire for it – for example with Vector …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>CALL FOR A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO THE USE OF SNATCH</p>
<p><b>824. </b> On 7 November 2008, Hodge Jones &amp; Allen solicitors wrote to Mr Hutton on behalf </p>
<p>of Ms Susan Smith, requesting a public inquiry into the use of Snatch Land Rovers in </p>
<p>the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> Ms Smith’s son, Private Phillip Hewett, was killed </p>
<p>on 16 July 2005 in an IED attack in al&#8209;Amara whilst travelling in a Snatch Land Rover. </p>
<p><b>825. </b> Treasury Solicitors replied on 15 December, enclosing a letter from Mr Hutton </p>
<p>to Ms Smith.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> Mr Hutton’s letter said that, “after thinking very carefully about what </p>
<p>has been said on this issue … a public inquiry would not be the right way to proceed”. </p>
<p>He would be issuing a Written Ministerial Statement the following day but had wanted </p>
<p>to write to Ms Smith personally.</p>
<p><b>826. </b> Mr Hutton explained that the reasons for not holding a public inquiry into the use </p>
<p>of Snatch were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The clear advice from military commanders, unanimously endorsed by the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff, was that Snatch vehicles were “essential to the success of </p>
<p>operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Heavier vehicles such as Warrior or Mastiff could not replace Snatch because </p>
<p>they could not “be used for all purposes” and were “simply unable to access” the </p>
<p>necessary places to deliver the UK’s objectives.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Better armoured vehicles, which tended to be larger and heavier, were “viewed </p>
<p>by the local population as aggressive and intimidating”. That made it more </p>
<p>difficult for the military to engage with local people and win their confidence. </p>
<p>The larger vehicles also could cause “serious damage” to local infrastructure </p>
<p>such as roads, buildings and drainage systems. Those factors could “inflame </p>
<p>local opinion against UK troops” and increase the threat level overall. </p>
<p><b>827. </b> Mr Hutton said that that meant “a critical requirement” for a light PPV such as </p>
<p>Snatch remained. He referred to the “number of technical enhancements” to Snatch </p>
<p>since its first deployment to Iraq in 2003. He stated that the introduction of its new </p>
<p>variant, the Snatch Vixen, along with the procurement of additional Mastiff vehicles, </p>
<p>would enable the UK “to continue reducing the scope of the Snatch 2A vehicle’s role </p>
<p>until it is used only within [UK] camps”.</p>
<p><b>828. </b> In his Written Ministerial Statement on 16 December, Mr Hutton referred to the </p>
<p>“widespread public concern over the thirty&#8209;seven deaths of British servicemen and </p>
<p>women in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of injuries sustained while using Snatch </p>
<p>Land Rovers”.</p>

<p>143</p>
<p><b>829. </b> Mr Hutton repeated the reasons he had provided to Ms Smith as to why he had </p>
<p>decided not to hold a public inquiry into the matter. He said it was “also important to </p>
<p>be clear” that it could not be assumed that the 37 servicemen and women would have </p>
<p>survived if they had been in more heavily armoured vehicles. Any vehicle could be </p>
<p>overmatched and armour was only one part of the tactics, techniques and procedures </p>
<p>that were used to protect troops.</p>
<p><b>830. </b> On 10 July 2009, Ms Smith won a right to a judicial review, on limited grounds, </p>
<p>of the Government’s decision not to hold a Snatch Inquiry.</p>
<p>443</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>831. </b> A letter from the Treasury Solicitors to Ms Smith’s solicitors on 15 September </p>
<p>stated that that had prompted a “fresh decision” by Mr Bob Ainsworth, who became the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary in June 2009. He had again considered the question of whether an </p>
<p>inquiry should be held and decided that an inquiry would be an inappropriate use of </p>
<p>public resources given the extent to which the subject had already been examined. </p>
<p><b>Legal action taken by families over the use of  </b></p>
<p><b>Snatch Land Rovers</b></p>
<p>On 19 June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that relatives of three soldiers killed in Iraq, </p>
<p>and two others seriously injured, had a right to sue the Government for negligence and </p>
<p>pursue damages under human rights legislation.</p>
<p>444</p>
<p> In doing so, the Court rejected the </p>
<p>MOD’s arguments that the principle of combat immunity applied; the MOD had a duty of </p>
<p>care over soldiers regardless of whether they had left the British base in the line of duty.</p>
<p>The proceedings concerned three sets of claims, one of which was brought by Ms Smith </p>
<p>(the mother of Private Phillip Hewett) and the relatives of Private Lee Ellis over the </p>
<p>MOD’s alleged breach of Article 2, the Human Right to Life, in the preventative measures </p>
<p>available to protect the lives of troops travelling in Snatch vehicles. Private Ellis’s relatives </p>
<p>also brought a claim of negligence against the MOD.</p>
<p>The case against the Government for damages and negligence was still continuing at the </p>
<p>time of the Iraq Inquiry’s publication.</p>
<p>The Iraq Inquiry has considered material provided by Hodge Jones &amp; Allen solicitors and </p>
<p>has taken account of that when putting questions to witnesses during the public hearings </p>
<p>and when drafting its Report. </p>

<p>ruled that the right was limited in that the past use of Snatch could be investigated, but its present and </p>

<p>SNATCH AFTER IRAQ</p>
<p><b>832. </b> Ridgback entered service in June 2009 in Afghanistan. It was not deployed to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>833. </b> On 6 March 2010, the BBC reported that Mr Brown visited troops in Afghanistan </p>
<p>and said that 200 new patrol vehicles would arrive in late 2011 to replace the Snatch </p>
<p>Land Rover.</p>
<p>445</p>
<p><b>834. </b> That new patrol vehicle was the Foxhound, which arrived in Afghanistan on </p>
<p>17 June 2012.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p> The MOD’s announcement about its arrival did not refer to the Snatch </p>
<p>Land Rover, or any other PPVs.</p>
<p><b>835. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The Foxhound is a Protected Patrol Vehicle. It underwent final testing in the </p>
<p>Helmand desert before being deployed on operations. Foxhound was specifically </p>
<p>designed and built in Britain to protect against the threats faced by troops in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, but it is an agile and versatile vehicle which will be a mainstay in the </p>
<p>Army for years to come. Being lighter and smaller than other protected vehicles, </p>
<p>Foxhound brings a new capability to the Army and is ideal for soldiers operating </p>
<p>in mentoring and partnering roles.”</p>
<p>447</p>
<p><b>836. </b> The Snatch 2 Land Rover remains in service with the British Army.</p>
<p>448</p>
<p> The British </p>
<p>Army’s website states that it is “deployed for general patrolling in low threat areas” and </p>
<p>is “being extensively replaced by Vector and Mastiff”.</p>
<p><b>The impact of Afghanistan on the equipment available in Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>837. </b> In June 2004, the UK had made a public commitment to deploy HQ ARRC to </p>
<p>Afghanistan in 2006, based on a recommendation from the Chiefs of Staff and Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>and with Mr Straw’s support. HQ ARRC was a NATO asset for which the UK was the </p>
<p>lead nation and provided 60 percent of its staff. That decision is described in Section </p>
<p>9.2. By October, that decision had become an important factor in considering resources </p>
<p>for Iraq.</p>
<p><b>838. </b> In July 2005, the DOP agreed proposals for both the transfer of the four provinces </p>
<p>in MND(SE) to Iraqi control and for the deployment of the UK Provincial Reconstruction </p>
<p>Team then based in northern Afghanistan to Helmand province in the South, along </p>
<p>with an infantry battlegroup and full helicopter support – around 2,500 personnel. </p>
<p>That decision is described in Section 9.4.</p>

<p><b>Existing capability gaps before 2006</b></p>
<p>ISTAR</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) is a </p>
<p>key military capability that generates and delivers specific information and intelligence </p>
<p>to decision&#8209;makers at all levels in support of the planning and conduct of operations.</p>
<p>449</p>
<p><b>842. </b> In 2008, the House of Commons Defence Committee defined three broad </p>
<p>categories of ISTAR:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>strategic – </b>including systems that provide early warning of ballistic missile </p>
<p>threats to the UK and the Nimrod R1 system that provided Manned Airborne </p>
<p>Surveillance (MAS);</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>operational –</b> systems that can operate from naval platforms or land and </p>
<p>provide air and surface surveillance using a mix of sensors; and</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>tactical –</b> man&#8209;portable and vehicle&#8209;mounted systems that provide electronic </p>
<p>surveillance for land forces.</p>
<p>450</p>
<p><b>843. </b> ISTAR is delivered through “two distinct but inter&#8209;related capability areas”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>The collection side – </b>which aims to provide capabilities that can gather </p>
<p>accurate and timely information across the environments and can detect, track </p>
<p>and identify enemy, neutral and friendly entities within a defined area, day and </p>
<p>night, and in all weathers.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The direction, processing and dissemination side – </b>which aims to provide </p>
<p>capabilities that can direct collection effort and then process and disseminate </p>
<p>derived information and intelligence to all levels in national and coalition </p>
<p>operations.”</p>
<p><b>844. </b> An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an important means of collecting ISTAR </p>
<p>information.</p>
<p><b>845. </b> The<i> Strategic Defence Review</i> (SDR) in 1998 had emphasised the importance of </p>
<p>ISTAR assets, “not only to maintain a qualitative edge in combat but to facilitate the often </p>
<p>rapid decision&#8209;making needed in complex political circumstances”.</p>

<p>147</p>
<p><b>854. </b> On 28 April 2003, MND(SE) produced a USUR for an “enhanced enduring ISTAR </p>
<p>capability for the UK land component”.</p>
<p>457</p>
<p> It explained that Phoenix had been supporting </p>
<p>Phase III operations at “rates far greater than previously foreseen in sustainability </p>
<p>planning guidance, and in temperatures exceeding the design specification”. </p>
<p><b>855. </b> The USUR noted that experience in Bosnia and Kosovo had demonstrated that </p>
<p>ISTAR systems that were “flexible, responsive, not manpower intensive, and with a </p>
<p>low ground footprint” were key to maintaining the Commander’s situational awareness </p>
<p>and protecting UK forces. In those areas, “with small AORs”, Phoenix had been used </p>
<p>“to great effect”.</p>
<p><b>856. </b> The USUR stated that 75 Phoenix UAVs had been deployed or moved into theatre </p>
<p>since operations started. By 15 April 2003, only 29 of those were still “fit” for use in </p>
<p>theatre. Seven had been lost to hostile action and 24 had crashed because of a fault in </p>
<p>the Phoenix’s system. </p>
<p><b>857. </b> There was no explanation of what had happened to the remaining 15 UAVs.</p>
<p><b>858. </b> Without “corrective action”, the USUR stated that current attrition rates meant </p>
<p>that there would be no Phoenix UAVs left in theatre by 6 May (without deploying War </p>
<p>Maintenance Reserve (WMR) stock), or that stocks would reduce to zero by 10 June </p>
<p>(if the WMR stock was fully deployed).</p>
<p><b>859. </b> A package of measures were “in train” to fix the fault causing Phoenix crashes </p>
<p>and to increase its availability in high temperatures. Neither set of measures would, </p>
<p>however, increase its endurance or the range at which it could be used. While Phoenix </p>
<p>would continue to be used in Iraq “by necessity”, there was an operational requirement </p>
<p>for an ISTAR system to support the duration of Op TELIC “with the required levels of </p>
<p>persistence, flexibility, responsiveness and in all climatic conditions, with the required </p>
<p>resolution to be able to identify and monitor difficult and often fleeting targets”.</p>
<p><b>860. </b> An initial operating capability was required “as soon as possible” with full operating </p>
<p>capability “not later than mid October 2003”.</p>
<p><b>861. </b> The covering minute, sent on behalf of Major General Graeme Lamb, GOC </p>
<p>MND(SE), recorded:</p>
<p>“The GOC sees provision of an enhanced UAV capability as essential to mitigate </p>
<p>reduced force structures in an extensive and complex AO [Area of Operations]. </p>
<p>CJO [Lt Gen Reith] was briefed on this requirement during his visit to the Division on </p>

<p><b>862. </b> An email exchange between PJHQ officials on 2 May stated that Major General </p>
<p>Peter Wall, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations (Operations), had “now approved the </p>
<p>progression of this” and the USUR should proceed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>458</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>863. </b> The UOR update to Lord Bach on 9 May highlighted the urgent requirement </p>
<p>for “a longer&#8209;range, more persistent UAV platform” and such a UAV was “seen as an </p>
<p>enduring requirement that would allow a reduction in force levels”.</p>
<p>459</p>
<p><b>864. </b> A footnote stated:</p>
<p>“To date Phoenix losses on Op TELIC have been 20 airframes lost in action and a </p>
<p>further 16 damaged beyond local repair (with a further three reported missing in the </p>
<p>last few days). This attrition rate leaves a capability gap of at least 36 air vehicles </p>
<p>against medium scale operations until Phoenix OSD [Out of Service Date]. Phoenix </p>
<p>is still being deployed therefore the attrition rate could rise.”</p>
<p><b>865. </b> At Lord Bach’s UOR meeting on 12 May, it was reported that options being </p>
<p>considered to meet the UAV requirement included “an off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf solution” and bringing </p>
<p>forward the Watchkeeper programme.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p><b>866. </b> AM Stirrup’s UOR update to Lord Bach on 30 May included a progress report on </p>
<p>the UAV UORs from the ISTAR Directorate of Equipment Capability (DEC(ISTAR)).</p>
<p>461</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>867. </b> It stated that, prior to the USUR being articulated, “a number of possible solutions” </p>
<p>had been identified that “could be delivered within six months, including advancing </p>
<p>certain hardware elements of Watchkeeper, but stopping short of providing an early </p>
<p>Watchkeeper capability”.</p>
<p><b>868. </b> The DEC also explained that UOR action had previously been “put on hold” while </p>
<p>an engine modification for Phoenix was pursued, to try and improve its performance </p>
<p>in extreme temperatures. </p>
<p><b>869. </b> The DEC proposed a “layered” system to meet the requirement:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Nimrod Mk2 would be used to provide wide area surveillance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“other air&#8209;based assets (such as fast jet tactical reconnaissance) would provide </p>
<p>medium/low level surveillance”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “small UAV system” would be procured to provide “low level ‘through the </p>
<p>window’ surveillance”. That could be implemented, “at least in part, almost </p>
<p>immediately”.</p>

<p>149</p>
<p><b>870. </b> The DEC’s proposal would “relieve some of the pressure” on the Phoenix Out of </p>
<p>Service Date (OSD) but there was a risk of a capability gap between the Phoenix OSD </p>
<p>and the Watchkeeper ISD:</p>
<p>“An analysis of the availability of Phoenix for future operations (whatever they may </p>
<p>be) when considered in light of the introduction of Watchkeeper, has indicated that </p>
<p>there is a risk of a capability gap developing. We will not be able to quantify this </p>
<p>fully until the repair situation on Phoenix is better understood. However, work is </p>
<p>in hand to look at options for mitigating this risk, including re&#8209;opening the Phoenix </p>
<p>production line …”</p>
<p><b>871. </b> AM Stirrup warned Lord Bach that the DEC’s update must be “put in context”, </p>
<p>noting the “considerable success” of UAVs during combat operations and indicating </p>
<p>that the capability gap had arisen because UK forces had entered a new phase in </p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p><b>872. </b> On 25 June, the House of Commons Defence Committee took evidence from Lord </p>
<p>Bach, Sir Peter Spencer and Lt Gen Fulton on the progress of the MOD’s Equipment </p>
<p>Programme.</p>
<p>462</p>
<p><b>873. </b> Asked why the Watchkeeper programme could not be accelerated, Lord Bach said </p>
<p>that “some elements” would be in service by “late 2005”. Concern was expressed by the </p>
<p>Committee that the MOD should not put its “head in the sand”, delaying the introduction </p>
<p>of Watchkeeper to the extent that “by the time it comes out, the concept has already </p>
<p>moved on”.</p>
<p><b>874. </b> The Chairman finished the line of questioning by saying that the project should </p>
<p>be watched closely “because the military requires it and requires it to be done pretty </p>
<p>damned quickly”.</p>
<p><b>875. </b> In its subsequent report, the Committee stated that the Watchkeeper and FRES </p>
<p>programmes both exemplified the MOD’s efforts to “bring important new capabilities into </p>
<p>service more quickly”. They also highlighted that, in conflict with the desire to speed up </p>
<p>progress, the MOD had maintained a cautious approach in both with a view to reducing </p>
<p>project risks. That demonstrated that the MOD was still finding it difficult to balance </p>
<p>“increased agility against decreased risk”.</p>
<p><b>876. </b> On 26 June, the DMB endorsed a paper from Mr Colin Balmer, MOD Finance </p>
<p>Director, on investment priorities for 2004’s Equipment Programme (STP/EP04).</p>
<p>463</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Network&#8209;enabled capability and deployable ISTAR were two areas of “vital ground” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>877. </b> An annex to the paper stated that enhancement of Intelligence Surveillance </p>
<p>Reconnaissance capability had emerged as “a priority Op TELIC lesson”.</p>
<p><b>878. </b> On 1 September, MND(SE) produced a Forces and Resources Review to examine </p>
<p>the resources required in MND(SE), for both short&#8209;term and enduring operations.</p>
<p>464</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>879. </b> The Review reiterated the requirement for greater surveillance capability. It stated: </p>
<p>“The evolving threat from terrorism in Basra City leads to the urgent requirement for </p>
<p>airborne surveillance of urban areas. Force protection measures limit the ability to </p>
<p>observe a situation from the ground, or to track vehicles/people along busy streets, </p>
<p>or to observe the situation remotely. Airborne surveillance would clearly enhance </p>
<p>both force protection and the ability to catch or kill terrorists … A surveillance </p>
<p>capability … could be fitted to the existing allocation of helicopters on Op TELIC.”</p>
<p><b>880. </b> On UAVs, the Review cited the USUR submitted to PJHQ in May. It added:</p>
<p>“The increasing significance of the international borders and the need for pylon </p>
<p>line surveillance has re&#8209;emphasised the importance of this capability. In addition, </p>
<p>counter&#8209;terrorist operations in urban areas and more focused operations against </p>
<p>both border activity and organised crime indicate that HQ MND(SE) will confirm the </p>
<p>value of redeploying Phoenix once the weather becomes sufficiently accommodating </p>
<p>in the Autumn.”</p>
<p><b>881. </b> The Review also identified a protected mobility requirement which is addressed </p>
<p>earlier in this Section.</p>
<p><b>882. </b> Major General Robin Brims, the Deputy Chief of Joint Operations, provided </p>
<p>a written update to the Chiefs of Staff on the Forces and Resources Review on </p>
<p>2 September.</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> He wrote that one of the “key elements” was the enduring requirement </p>
<p>to “increase force protection, commence ICDC [Iraqi Civil Defence Corps] training and </p>
<p>to improve the ISTAR capability in MND(SE)”.</p>
<p><b>883. </b> Maj Gen Brims recommended the Chiefs agree that “DEC(ISTAR) should do all </p>
<p>that is possible to accelerate the introduction of a new UAV, Desert Hawk, not currently </p>
<p>believed to be available until Dec 03 at the very earliest”. Phoenix UAVs would be </p>
<p>deployed in the interim when the weather conditions became “appropriate”.</p>

<p><b>888. </b> ISTAR was also an area identified for savings and included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£4m to delay the practical experimentation of UAVs by six months, which would </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>delaying the Watchkeeper Assessment Phase, due to be concluded in </p>
<p>April 2004, by six months. The interim operating capabililty would consequently </p>
<p>be delayed by a year to 2007.</p>
<p><b>889. </b> On 6 October, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to No.10, confirming </p>

<p><b>893. </b> On 18 November, Mr David Williams, MOD Director of Capabilities, Resources </p>
<p>and Scrutiny, wrote to Mr John Dodds, Head of the Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence </p>
<p>Team in the Treasury, seeking advice on how to take forward new force protection </p>
<p>measures within the agreed UOR “ceiling”.</p>
<p>472</p>
<p> Mr Williams flagged a new requirement </p>
<p>for £22m of UOR funding for area surveillance. Mr Williams’ request for the funding </p>
<p>of electronic countermeasures is addressed earlier in this Section with regards to </p>
<p>protected mobility.</p>
<p><b>894. </b> Mr Williams described the need for air surveillance assets as “effectively a ‘force </p>
<p>multiplier’ in that a greater effect could be achieved by cueing and focusing fewer ground </p>
<p>assets than by maintaining large bodies of troops in static guarding roles”. The existing </p>
<p>arrangement, whereby UK military personnel were guarding key sites within MND(SE), </p>
<p>had prevented troops from being employed in more “proactive, deterrent or offensive </p>
<p>security tasks” and raised more suspicion than would be the case with more remote </p>
<p>surveillance, such as helicopters and UAVs.</p>
<p><b>895. </b> Mr Williams wrote:</p>
<p>“The potential solution to the requirement is to seek area surveillance capabilities </p>
<p>since our forces lack UK&#8209;dedicated, persistent (in terms of time/duration over the </p>
<p>areas/targets we wish to watch) near real&#8209;time and long&#8209;range capabilities, suited </p>
<p>to the differing requirements in urban and rural areas, that can produce pictures …” </p>
<p><b>896. </b> Mr Williams stated that, to date, the MOD had deployed a combination of assets </p>
<p>in its inventory but only as an interim solution and this had not been effective for urban </p>
<p>areas. In addition, the interim systems would suffer in spring when the weather became </p>
<p>hotter and some aircraft would be required to return to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p><b>897. </b> Mr Williams wrote that this was being addressed by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a surveillance solution based on a UAV that would cost approximately £10m </p>
<p>for which three potential suppliers had been sent an Invitation To Tender; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>potentially using Lynx helicopters with a surveillance pod for the urban </p>
<p>requirement; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a manned surveillance platform for the “pan&#8209;Iraq” requirement.</p>

<p><b>The impact of savings measures between 2004 and 2005 </b></p>
<p><b>on ISTAR provision</b></p>
<p>On 26 February 2004, the Defence Management Board (DMB) agreed a large number </p>
<p>of service enhancements and savings measures that should be offered as part of a </p>
<p>Spending Review.</p>
<p>474</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DMB considered a paper by Mr Trevor Woolley, MOD Finance Director, which </p>
<p>detailed all the measures.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> It proposed cutting the budget of £33m for the practical </p>
<p>experimentation of UAVs over the following two financial years, which would retain a team </p>
<p>to conduct trials and inform future CONOPS development but:</p>
<p>“… there would be significantly reduced pull&#8209;through to programmes addressing </p>
<p>capability gaps in the persistent deep ISTAR of land and close or complex terrain. </p>
<p>This option is entirely dependent on the deferral of £4m from 03/04 …”</p>
<p>That measure was one which the DMB felt needed further consideration because of the </p>
<p>impact on other programmes. </p>
<p>On 26 January 2005, the DMB discussed proposals in a paper by Mr Woolley on the </p>
<p>‘Future Defence Programme’.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On network&#8209;enabled capability and ISTAR, Mr Woolley wrote that it had been “necessary </p>
<p>to assume significant savings” within the Equipment Programme, despite attempts to </p>
<p>mitigate them “as far as possible”. Those savings would require “careful consideration” </p>
<p>and included the decision to defer Watchkeeper by one year, “but with a planned limited </p>
<p>interim capability to support deployments from 2006”.</p>
<p>The minutes from the DMB meeting recorded that the measure to defer Watchkeeper </p>
<p>would incur additional short&#8209;term costs for supporting “older, less capable equipment” </p>
<p>but those had been allowed for.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> The measure was approved.</p>

<p>It was noted that pursuing the Hermes system could also potentially “disrupt” the </p>
<p>Watchkeeper programme because it could involve the same contractor.</p>
<p><b>902. </b> Mr Ingram was advised that a third option had emerged: the creation of a Joint </p>
<p>Predator Task Force with the US, using US equipment but drawing on UK manpower </p>
<p>to support an additional US Predator in the UK’s Area of Responsibility (AOR). It was </p>
<p>viewed as “the most promising option” in terms of performance, cost and time.</p>
<p><b>903. </b> As training on the Predator took at least 40 days, it had already been agreed that </p>
<p>RAF personnel would begin the next available course starting on 2 February.</p>
<p><b>904. </b> Mr Ingram received an update on what became the Combined Joint Predator UAV </p>
<p>Task Force (CJPTF) on 30 April.</p>
<p>479</p>
<p> An official wrote that a drawback of the proposal had </p>
<p>been “the inability to provide a full capability until the turn of 2004/05”, largely because </p>
<p>sufficient Predator ground stations were “not available until then”.</p>
<p><b>905. </b> While the US expected, “depending on the circumstances”, to allocate increasing </p>
<p>amounts of existing Predator time to the UK AOR as the UK’s participation in the </p>
<p>CJPTF grew from June 2004, “there would be no immediate solution to the existing </p>
<p>capability gap”. </p>
<p><b>906. </b> The official wrote that it had “therefore been agreed” to provide an interim solution </p>
<p>by fitting a datalink to five Nimrod MR2 equipped with the necessary sensors. The </p>
<p>datalink equipment would be loaned by the US and would “enable the Nimrod to provide </p>
<p>near real time imagery to ground stations in a manner very similar to Predator”. </p>
<p><b>907. </b> That solution could not be sustained “beyond the turn of the year” because all five </p>
<p>Nimrods required “major servicing” and the official accepted it was not a cost&#8209;effective </p>
<p>solution to the capability gap.</p>

<p><b>910. </b> Lt Gen Ridgway warned that, despite those initiatives, “this major capability gap” </p>
<p>was likely to prevail until “end 04 with a particular shortfall over the summer months”.</p>
<p><b>911. </b> In considering solutions, the provision of a new UK UAV system had “been </p>
<p>discounted”. That included options provided by the Watchkeeper contractors and </p>
<p>the loan of a number of Predator systems from the US because: </p>
<p>“Detailed work identified that current MOD policy for airworthiness and safety for </p>
<p>UAV systems would not allow the use of a new system or the use of Predator under </p>
<p>UK regulation in a timely and cost&#8209;effective manner.”</p>
<p><b>912. </b> Lt Gen Ridgway wrote that the Watchkeeper programme was expected to proceed </p>
<p>to Main Gate later that year, with “an element of capability to be available from 2006”.</p>
<p><b>913. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office replied on 23 June that Mr Hoon had:</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“The conclusion is that the UK needs an all&#8209;weather airborne UAV in sufficient </p>
<p>numbers to guarantee availability in operations of this nature.” </p>
<p><b>916. </b> In October, there was a suggestion that the Apache attack helicopter should </p>
<p>be deployed to Iraq as an additional ISTAR asset but it was decided that the attack </p>
<p>helicopter programme was not of sufficient maturity and there was no immediate </p>
<p>operational requirement for such a measure.</p>
<p>483</p>
<p><b>917. </b> In his post&#8209;operation tour report on 4 December, Major General William Rollo, </p>
<p>GOC MND(SE) from July to December 2004, wrote:</p>
<p>“There is a constant demand across the Division for airborne imagery. NIMROD </p>
<p>MR2 does an excellent job, but it is in short supply due to a finite number of </p>
<p>aircraft and insufficient flying hours. P4 [Puma] is available and in high demand, </p>
<p>but is difficult to maintain and although there is a surge capacity to use two, it is </p>
<p>constrained by lack of spares. Phoenix can only fly from November to April due to </p>
<p>temperature restrictions. It is also restricted to rural areas. Predator is technically </p>
<p>available, but only if the division has a mission of sufficiently high priority … This </p>
<p>means that there is a continual shortage of overhead ISTAR within the Division </p>
<p>resulting in operations being planned around ISTAR availability, rather than </p>
<p>ISTAR being available for operations. There is a requirement for more airborne </p>
<p>reconnaissance platforms with greater endurance to allow for observation of pattern </p>
<p>of life of both people and places and to assist asset tracking.”</p>

<p>“Military activities within a continuum of operations have varied widely, but </p>
<p>after an upsurge in the level of violence, the campaign has become a unique </p>
<p>Counter&#8209;insurgency (COIN) operation – an evolution that fits no neat recent </p>
<p>historical or doctrinal model.”</p>
<p><b>919. </b> The report highlighted ISTAR as one of the five key lessons for the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>to consider:</p>
<p>“Future ISTAR procurement strategies should recognise the UK’s limited capability </p>

<p>represents the most significant capability shortfall on Operation TELIC Phase IV and </p>
<p>is likely to remain an enduring requirement, particularly for asymmetric warfare.”</p>
<p><b>920. </b> The report stated:</p>
<p>“UK forces lack sufficient ISTAR capability to provide persistence and the ability </p>
<p>to stream imagery in real time and cross&#8209;component, over a wide range of </p>
<p>climatic conditions … This capability shortfall has been highlighted on all recent </p>
<p>UK operations … Some rotary platforms have proved too vulnerable to ground </p>
<p>attack, and whilst the covert characteristics of UAVs make them well suited to the </p>
<p>ISTAR role, the Phoenix UAV can only operate for half the year in&#8209;theatre due to </p>
<p>temperature restrictions.”</p>
<p><b>921. </b> The report highlighted that use of US Predator and “several UORs” to increase </p>
<p>manned airborne surveillance capabilities had helped to alleviate the capability gap. </p>
<p><b>922. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the DOC Report on 22 February.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>923. </b> The minutes recorded that “connectivity was key to bridging the ISTAR capability </p>
<p>gap and enhancing the overall operational agility”. Lt Gen Fry had advised that “a </p>

<p>represented a significant step forward in connecting the many previously stove&#8209;piped </p>
<p>collection assets into a coherent ISTAR plan. Much work was still required and three </p>
<p>key investment decisions were identified:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The balance of investment between ISTAR and other military capabilities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The apportionment of investment between collection, data management and </p>

<p>SUPPORT HELICOPTERS</p>
<p><b>929. </b> During operations, the role of a support helicopter can involve transportation of </p>
<p>personnel and supplies, surveillance or medical evacuation. That is different from the </p>
<p>role of an attack helicopter which delivers fire support to troops on the ground. This </p>
<p>Section focuses on support helicopters and how they complemented the land operation </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>930. </b> The term “battlefield helicopter” can cover both types but in the material that </p>
<p>follows it appears to refer largely to support helicopters.</p>
<p><b>931. </b> The UK’s campaign in Iraq, following the invasion, was classified as a medium </p>
<p>scale operation in terms of MOD planning assumptions. The MOD told the Inquiry that, </p>
<p>in 2003 for a medium scale ground operation, the maximum number of helicopters </p>
<p>would be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>21 heavy support helicopters;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>41 medium support helicopters; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>44 light support helicopters.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p><b>932. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that the UK’s support helicopter fleet in 2003 comprised </p>

<p>31 Chinook Mk2/2a;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>comprising Chinook, Sea King, Puma and Gazelle”.</p>
<p><b>936. </b> The DMB was advised on 26 June that the recuperation of helicopters deployed </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>940. </b> On 6 February, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, the Chief of Air Staff, replied:</p>
<p>“The RAF can sustain its current commitments, but with the likely increased </p>
<p>involvement in Afghanistan our air transport, support helicopters and possibly </p>
<p>RAF Regiment forces will be seriously stretched.”</p>
<p>497</p>
<p><b>941. </b> The minutes of the DMB on 26 February 2004 agreed a large number of service </p>
<p>enhancements and savings measures as part of the Spending Review.</p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>942. </b> The DMB recognised that rotary capability “had been a constraint for some </p>
<p>time”. Helicopters were “used everywhere, and were one of the key ingredients of </p>
<p>lower intensity operations”. On that basis, several proposed measures affecting </p>
<p>“key operational enablers (Puma, Gazelle, Sea King, Chinook) had already been </p>
<p>reprieved” but a number of remaining measures reduced DLO support capability. </p>
<p><b>943. </b> The DMB considered a paper by Mr Woolley which detailed all the measures.</p>
<p>499</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>944. </b> Mr Woolley wrote: “The Army’s current and planned operational tempo </p>
<p>exceeds Defence Planning Assumptions.” His paper had taken into account work </p>
<p>from commitments and programmes staff, in conjunction with Front Line Commands </p>
<p>and PJHQ, to assess the UK’s current and likely future military commitments over the </p>
<p>following 30 months. That assessment was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq would continue to be a medium scale operation until the end of March 2006 </p>
<p>when it would downsize to a small scale operation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Afghanistan commitment would remain small scale until January 2005 when </p>
<p>it would increase to a “small(+) to medium scale(&#8209;)” until the end of January </p>
<p>2006. It would become a small scale operation from the end of January 2006. </p>
<p><b>945. </b> Mr Woolley wrote that Land Command had previously taken a number of measures </p>
<p>into its core programme to contain expenditure within control levels, including the </p>
<p>reduction of rotary environmental training by 25 percent which had “impaired battlefield </p>
<p>helicopter readiness and constrained operational flexibility in Northern Ireland”. There </p>
<p>had been further reductions in rotary wing activity in Northern Ireland as part of a </p>
<p>deliberate switch in operational focus to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>946. </b> Mr Woolley wrote:</p>
<p>“Collectively, these measures have already started to erode the Army’s core </p>
<p>competencies in war&#8209;fighting at formation level, and overall readiness levels. </p>
<p>The cumulative effect of this will be to progressively degrade the effective delivery </p>
<p>of force elements within the Land component.”</p>

<p>161</p>
<p><b>947. </b> The recommended savings measures included further reductions in rotary wing </p>
<p>activity that would “restrict the support to Land collective training to 60 percent of the </p>
<p>requirement, impacting directly on operations and tour intervals for pilots”. Mr Woolley </p>
<p>added:</p>
<p>“This conflicts with an increased rotary wing requirement to support the likely uplift </p>
<p>in operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan over the next two years.”</p>
<p><b>948. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that, until 2004, it had been planning to replace its Puma </p>
<p>and Sea King fleets through the Support Amphibious Battlefield Helicopter (SABR) </p>
<p>programme.</p>
<p>500</p>
<p> The Initial Gate business case in late 2003 had suggested that “the most </p>
<p>likely solution” was the procurement of 50 to 60 additional Chinook aircraft with the first </p>
<p>six expected in 2012/13 and the full order by 2025.</p>
<p><b>949. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that, during the planning round in 2004, as part of a </p>
<p>broad departmental affordability exercise, a £1.4bn saving was taken from the total </p>
<p>helicopter programme.</p>
<p><b>950. </b> The MOD abandoned the SABR programme and, following a revision of the </p>
<p>wider helicopter procurement strategy, created the Future Rotorcraft Capability (FRC) </p>
<p>programme. </p>
<p><b>951. </b> The Inquiry asked the MOD whether the £1.4bn referred to in its statement was </p>
<p>the result of the savings measures proposed in Mr Woolley’s paper. It replied:</p>
<p>“Not quite. The paper presented by [Mr] Trevor Woolley … explored ways of </p>
<p>removing costs from the first two years of the Defence Programme. Among the </p>
<p>proposals it recommended were measures intended to save some £420m from </p>
<p>helicopter acquisition and support. These savings were spread across the ten year </p>
<p>equipment programme and the four year equipment support programme but … were </p>
<p>heavily weighted towards the years 2004/05 and 2005/06. Separate work, known as </p>
<p>the Medium Term Workstrands, looked at ways to balance the defence programme </p>
<p>against available resources in the years beyond 2005/06. The outcome of this work </p>
<p>was presented to the Defence Board in April 2004. It included recommendations </p>
<p>to reduce spending on helicopter acquisition and support by a further £1bn. The </p>
<p>£1.4bn saving mentioned in our statement of 1 March 2011 therefore arose from two </p>
<p>separate but closely related exercises.”</p>
<p>501</p>
<p><b>952. </b> On 26 January 2005, the DMB discussed proposals on the ‘Future Defence </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>953. </b> For battlefield helicopters, Mr Woolley wrote that “planned activity levels over the </p>
<p>next two years remain at or above the maximum concurrency assumed in provisional </p>
<p>DPAs”. Commitments were only being met by compromising the Harmony Guidelines</p>
<p>503</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and using crews and key support staff at tour intervals of “1on/2off or less” instead of </p>
<p>“1on/4 off”. </p>
<p><b>954. </b> Mr Woolley concluded:</p>
<p>“Increasing significantly the size of rotorcraft fleet and training more crews are </p>
<p>not realistic options, nor in the short term is reducing the level of operational </p>
<p>commitment. The only viable strategy is to accept a reduced harmony ratio of </p>
<p>1on/2 off over the next two years, requiring careful management of key personnel. </p>
<p>The Puma and Chinook fleets are currently under the greatest pressure.”</p>
<p><b>955. </b> The £3.2bn across 10 years for investment in the FRC programme had also been </p>
<p>affected, with £60m from the first eight years having been re&#8209;profiled. Mr Woolley wrote </p>
<p>that “considerable effort” had gone into identifying the consequences of that decision </p>
<p>for existing helicopter fleets and “the most significant risk” would be sustaining Puma </p>
<p>and Lynx through to the introduction of their replacements. Additional funding had been </p>
<p>allocated to Lynx to extend its time in service until its replacement was available, albeit </p>
<p>at a reduced fleet size of 66 (from 82).</p>
<p><b>956. </b> The DMB agreed that a measure to reduce Joint Helicopter Command (JHC) </p>
<p>activity levels should be offset by measures to restore Chinook and Puma funding </p>
<p>because “it was felt that these additional costs were an acceptable financial risk, given </p>
<p>the significant operational benefits”.</p>
<p>504</p>
<p><b>957. </b> A proposed reduction in Gazelle activity was rejected, with compensating savings </p>
<p>to be found elsewhere in the land budget. The activity reductions for other helicopters </p>
<p>“although unwelcome, were acceptable”.</p>
<p><b>958. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that it withdrew its Chinook helicopters from Iraq in 2005 </p>
<p>in order to prepare for operations in Afghanistan and replaced them with the Merlin </p>
<p>helicopters.</p>
<p>505</p>
<p> The MOD stated that was because Chinook helicopters were better suited </p>
<p>to the challenging conditions found in Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>959. </b> In a statement to the Inquiry, ACM Torpy explained:</p>
<p>“… as confidence in Merlin grew it was possible to withdraw Chinook from Iraq to </p>
<p>allow the force to recuperate from a prolonged period on operations. It also gave </p>
<p>the force the opportunity to prepare for operations in Afghanistan, where the hot </p>
<p>503 </p>
<p>Harmony Guidelines described the maximum time that Service Personnel should spend away from </p>
<p>their families (known as Individual Separated Service) and the minimum time that they should have </p>
<p>between operational deployments (known as tour intervals). Harmony Guidelines are addressed in detail </p>

<p>507</p>
<p><b>961. </b> In Iraq, the developing threat in MND(SE) meant that ground movement had </p>

<p><b>962. </b> The impact on civilian personnel is addressed in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>963. </b> On 5 July, General Sir Timothy Granville&#8209;Chapman, the Vice Chief of Defence </p>

<p>the “logistics related factors” affecting flying hours and operating fleet size for support </p>
<p>helicopters.</p>
<p>508</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>964. </b> On 27 July, the minutes from the Chiefs of Staff meeting stated:</p>
<p>“Following the recent attacks in Maysan, procedures have been modified to counter </p>
<p>the threat … The current cycle of attacks had ‘fixed’ CF [coalition forces] in the area </p>
<p>and, as a result, progress on SSR had stagnated; PJHQ had therefore asked for an </p>
<p>urgent review of UK SH [support helicopters] priorities, to see if further assets could </p>
<p>be allocated to MND(SE). Given that SH were always in short supply, DCDS(C) </p>
<p>[Lt Gen Fry] highlighted the need to ensure that current asset availability was </p>
<p>maximised.”</p>

<p><b>965. </b> Air Vice&#8209;Marshal Kevin Leeson, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Logistic </p>

<p><b>966. </b> On 8 September, MOD officials provided Gen O’Donoghue with an estimate of </p>
<p>what increases in output were available from the existing support helicopter fleet.</p>
<p>510</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The officials advised that, “given appropriate funding”, there was potential to increase </p>
<p>both flying hours and the operating fleet size for all types of support helicopter, with the </p>
<p>exception of Merlin. </p>
<p><b>967. </b> The officials advised Gen O’Donoghue that several factors had to be taken into </p>
<p>account, including that any increase in operational flying would require an increase </p>
<p>in Deployable Spares Packs (DSPs), the lack of which had been a recognised issue </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>968. </b> The MOD officials wrote that “for some platforms deployability and sustainment on </p>
<p>operations would be enhanced through the provision of sufficiently ranged, scaled and </p>
<p>supported DSPs; for those platforms currently deployed on operations, CPF [Conflict </p>
<p>Prevention Fund] claims mechanisms and Urgent Sustainability Requirements are </p>
<p>already in place”. </p>
<p><b>969. </b> Gen O’Donoghue wrote to Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman about those findings on </p>
<p>14 September to say that the MOD was “currently missing a clear statement of the </p>
<p>operational requirement for SH – both readiness and sustainment”.</p>
<p>511</p>
<p><b>970. </b> Gen O’Donoghue wrote that a paper was being produced for a meeting on </p>
<p>7 October. It was “an extensive piece of work” which was expected to clarify the </p>
<p>requirements. Gen O’ Donoghue wrote that he would “therefore concentrate this minute </p>
<p>on the art of the possible and focus on what can be ‘sweated’ from our current fleet”.</p>
<p><b>971. </b> There were three groups of factors which had to be addressed to deliver </p>
<p>improved availability:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“depth maintenance and support”, including the need to accelerate Repair and </p>
<p>Overhaul (R&amp;O) output and better utilisation of the sustainment fleet;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“forward logistic factors” such as DSPs and maintenance manpower; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>aircrew availability and requirement, which was “an issue for the FLCs [Front </p>
<p>Line Commands]”.</p>
<p><b>972. </b> On 12 September, the Private Office of Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, </p>
<p>sought confirmation from Gen Walker whether, “in the event of a slower than expected </p>
<p>drawdown of UK forces in Iraq”, the planning assumptions for deployment to Afghanistan </p>
<p>would be achievable.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p><b>973. </b> Gen Walker’s Office replied on 19 September.</p>
<p>513</p>
<p> The “short answer” was “yes” but </p>
<p>with the warning that “such a situation would lead to some pain and grief”. In particular:</p>
<p>“The hoped for easement of pressure on our current ‘pinch points’, especially </p>
<p>helicopter support … would be delayed.” </p>
<p><b>974. </b> On 19 September, two UK soldiers were involved in what became known as </p>
<p>“the Jameat incident”; an incident where they were arrested and mistreated by Iraqi </p>
<p>Police Service (IPS) personnel and only released after a second rescue operation was </p>
<p>successful. That incident is covered in detail in Sections 9.4 and 12.1, along with its </p>
<p>implications for security in Basra.</p>
<p><b>975. </b> A paper considering those implications, produced jointly by the FCO, the MOD </p>

<p>“<b>We will need to allocate more resources, which may include military </b></p>

<p>515</p>
<p> wrote to PJHQ, agreeing to provide additional Merlin helicopters.</p>
<p>516</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>978. </b> AM Nickols also agreed an uplift of 180 Merlin hours per month for JHF&#8209;I </p>
<p>until mid&#8209;December. He cited JHC’s declaration that the previously agreed support </p>
<p>surge commitment had to end by 5 December for “fleet sustainability issues”. The </p>

<p><b>982. </b> On 24 October, Maj Gen Wall sent Major General James Dutton, GOC MND(SE), </p>
<p>the Terms of Reference for an aviation Force Level Review that had been directed by </p>
<p>AM Torpy because of the heightened IED threat.</p>
<p>521</p>
<p> Its aims were to identify aviation </p>
<p>requirements in MND(SE) between December 2005 and April 2006 and recommend how </p>
<p>to meet them. It would also identify “broad resource requirements” between May and </p>
<p>November 2006.</p>
<p><b>983. </b> The planning assumptions for the Review included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“threat levels remain broadly constant at current levels”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a mandate for Coalition presence will endure into 2006”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“development of ISF [Iraqi Security Forces’] capability will proceed to projected </p>
<p>timelines”. </p>
<p><b>984. </b> Following the Review, on 17 November Maj Gen Wall recommended to  </p>
<p>AM Nickols that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Only one of the two surge Merlin deployed in October 2005 (to support Security </p>
<p>Sector Reform (SSR) in Maysan) be returned to the UK after the December </p>
<p>elections, leaving a total of five in theatre. That should “reduce the risk of road </p>
<p>movement” for certain tasks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The surge Sea King remain in theatre as an enduring requirement but a utility </p>
<p>Sea King be withdrawn after the elections leaving five utility variants.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Three [Helicopter Broadsword]</p>
<p>522</p>
<p> would also remain in theatre.</p>
<p>523</p>
<p><b>985. </b> The seventh Merlin had already been withdrawn following the completion of the </p>
<p>troop rotation but it was likely that another short&#8209;term surge of helicopter capacity would </p>
<p>be required for the following troop rotation in April 2006. </p>
<p><b>986. </b> Maj Gen Wall wrote that “a significant proportion of aviation” was used  </p>
<p>for “administrative movements within theatre” and for “wider ISTAR tasking”.  </p>
<p>He stated that the Review had highlighted “a range of potential procedural, technical  </p>
<p>and tactical measures” to reduce the demand for helicopters but this was “subject to </p>

<p> His visit report recorded:</p>
<p>“… levels of consent from MNF presence were slowly declining throughout the </p>
<p>AOR [Area of Operations]. When considering military activity in the AOR, broadly </p>
<p>60 percent of our effort was devoted to force protection and sustainment of the UK </p>
<p>laydown, 30 percent to SSR [Security Sector Reform] and just 5 percent or so to </p>
<p>UK COIN [counter&#8209;insurgency]. Notwithstanding the planned reduction in British </p>
<p>infantry companies, the AOR geography and operational situation meant that there </p>
<p>could not be a proportional reduction in enablers, particularly support helicopters </p>
<p>and ISTAR …”</p>
<p><b>989. </b> On the JHF&#8209;I, Gen Walker wrote:</p>
<p>“… the weight of force protection and administrative tasking was such that the JHF&#8209;I </p>
<p>was unable to achieve any significant stabilisation or security tasking; the position </p>
<p>was exacerbated during the two months of the TELIC roulement when the JHF&#8209;I </p>
<p>had no spare capacity; it was questionable whether this fixing of precious support </p>
<p>helicopter (SH) capability made tactical, operational or logistical sense.”</p>
<p><b>990. </b> In his Hauldown Report on 12 December, Maj Gen Dutton wrote to AM Torpy: </p>
<p>“Helicopters have always been important in this area, half the size of England and </p>
<p>Wales, but the EFP threat has made them essential. I have been grateful for the </p>
<p>readiness to support us with extra when required and we have reciprocated by </p>
<p>readily agreeing to a reduction when the immediate crisis passed. However this </p>
<p>should not disguise the national lack of helicopters to service the operations that we </p>
<p>are now conducting. Massaging airframes and hours can only go so far: the simple </p>
<p>fact is that we need more helicopters (and aircrew) urgently.”</p>
<p>525</p>

<p><b>991. </b> In his post&#8209;tour report on 18 January 2006, Maj Gen Dutton reiterated the point:</p>
<p>“The hours available to the aircraft in theatre are simply inadequate to reduce </p>
<p>routine administrative ground movement in a period of heightened IED threat and </p>
<p>to conduct helicopter&#8209;borne operations. The GOC has to personally authorise </p>
<p>coach moves and the FP [force protection] measures required for even the short </p>
<p>move between BAS [Basra Air Station] and SLB [Shaibah Logistics Base] requires </p>

<p>527</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>993. </b> The impact of that decision was summarised neatly by Gen Walker as:</p>
<p>“Militarily, the UK force structure is already stretched and, with two concurrent </p>

<p>areas.”</p>

<p><b>994. </b> On 31 January, Lieutenant General Robert Fulton, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Equipment Capability) (DCDS(EC)), wrote to Gen Walker outlining the options for </p>
<p>getting “better operational utilisation” from support helicopters.</p>
<p>529</p>
<p> He stated: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Work to increase the utilisation of existing support helicopters was already under </p>
<p>way as part of a Chinook Operational Effectiveness Study. That represented the </p>
<p>only short&#8209;term option to improve the availability of support helicopters within </p>
<p>existing resources.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Utilisation of a simpler, cheaper aircraft”, such as the recovered Sea King Mk6, </p>
<p>to meet non&#8209;operational tasking had some potential to alleviate pressure on the </p>
<p>operationally&#8209;equipped fleet. Equipment Programme funding could be “made </p>

<p><b>995. </b> Lt Gen Fulton advised Gen Walker that the view of “Customer Two”, the Front </p>
<p>Line Commands, was that the problems in managing a larger number of recovered </p>
<p>Sea King would “probably outweigh any advantage”. They thought the best way to </p>
<p>“leverage better performance” was to continue seeking to “fly the existing aircraft harder </p>
<p>by improving servicing, processes and spares delivery”.</p>
<p><b>996. </b> Customer Two was keen to explore the potential merits of “running on either </p>
<p>Puma or Sea King” to achieve the Equipment Programme “stagger required to introduce, </p>
<p>in affordable tranches, a future new helicopter”.</p>
<p><b>997. </b> In his post&#8209;operation tour report on 18 January 2006, Maj Gen Dutton wrote:</p>
<p>“The importance of ISTAR platforms within this theatre cannot be overstated.”</p>
<p>530</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>998. </b> Maj Gen Dutton referred to helicopters fitted with Broadsword capability. He stated </p>
<p>that [Helicopter Broadsword] was good but suffered availability limitations as with all </p>
<p>aircraft in theatre. Nimrod was also good but orientated towards [UK theatre forces]</p>
<p>531</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and therefore not dedicated to MND(SE). He highlighted the need to maintain and </p>
<p>possibly increase ISTAR coverage as the UK moved towards Operational Overwatch.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1000. </b> The aviation support to MND(SE) was provided by: five Merlin, five Sea King, </p>
<p>three [Helicopter Broadsword] and four Lynx. Lt Gen Houghton wrote that there was </p>
<p>a requirement for Merlin and Lynx to remain throughout Operational Overwatch but </p>
<p>changes to tasking lines and servicing routines enabled a reduction of two Sea King as </p>
<p>an “efficiency measure”. He highlighted the possibility of further helicopter reductions </p>
<p>following the anticipated transition to Provincial Iraqi Control in Maysan, Muthanna and </p>
<p>Basra provinces.</p>
<p><b>1001. </b> On ISTAR, Lt Gen Houghton stated that “Full Motion Video” (FMV) capability was </p>
<p>provided by Nimrod (Iraq&#8209;wide), [Helicopter Broadsword] (MND(SE)&#8209;wide) and Phoenix </p>
<p>(locally).</p>
<p><b>1002. </b> Phoenix would again be withdrawn for the summer months and would not be </p>

<p> The minutes recorded that one of the points highlighted by Lt Gen Houghton </p>
<p>was that, despite the withdrawal of two helicopters, helicopter flying hours would be </p>
<p>“sustained by the more efficient use of other assets”. </p>
<p><b>1004. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that “the withdrawal of Phoenix would leave an ISTAR </p>
<p>deficit” and MND(SE) had “already been tasked to review its ISTAR requirements”. </p>
<p>Possible “mitigation was by the availability of unused Nimrod MR2 hours and the </p>
<p>possibility of negotiating US Predator tasking”. Gen Jackson would explore the </p>

<p>THE DOC’S THIRD REPORT, 4 APRIL 2006</p>
<p><b>1006. </b> On 4 April, the DOC published its third report of Op TELIC lessons to cover the </p>
<p>period from 1 December 2004 to 28 February 2006.</p>
<p>536</p>
<p><b>1007. </b> The report contained a section on “National Issues” described as “issues that </p>
<p>warrant MOD’s attention due to the impact on operational capability”. Such issues </p>
<p>affected “not only Iraq but may have a wider significance for other operations, including </p>
<p>Afghanistan”. Those issues included: counter IED capability (as addressed earlier in this </p>
<p>Section with regard to protected mobility), ISTAR, helicopters, air transport and force </p>
<p>protection engineering.</p>
<p><b>1008. </b> On ISTAR, the DOC stated that within Iraq there remained “a serious gap </p>
<p>in current ISTAR capability – particularly in urban areas”. That was “a regular DOC </p>
<p>observation that has been highlighted on all recent operations”. </p>
<p><b>1009. </b> The report cited “a specific problem with surveillance generally and with </p>
<p>UAVs specifically”, referring to the “identified gap” between the Phoenix OSD and </p>
<p>Watchkeeper ISD of two years. That situation “had changed again” and the Watchkeeper </p>
<p>ISD had slipped to “Not to Extend (NTE) beyond January 2011”. </p>
<p><b>1010. </b> The MOD Investment Approvals Board (IAB) had directed that the gap should </p>
<p>be viewed in two parts: theatre&#8209;specific in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2008, and the </p>
<p>generic contingent war&#8209;fighting tactical UAV capability from 2007 to 2010. There was the </p>
<p>additional, shorter&#8209;term problem that Phoenix could only operate in winter, and Desert </p>
<p>Hawk was incompatible with electronic countermeasures. The Combined Joint Predator </p>
<p>UAV Task Force (CJPTF) provided “limited coverage of MND(SE)”. </p>

<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>1011. </b> The DOC recommended:</p>
<p>“… we should reconsider addressing the ISTAR capability requirements, particularly </p>
<p>in addressing surveillance generally and UAVs specifically.”</p>
<p><b>1012. </b> On battlefield helicopters, the report stated that their capacity to support </p>
<p>operations had “become parlous at times during 2005”. </p>
<p><b>1013. </b> The DOC added: </p>
<p>“The requirement for an air bridge between Baghdad International Airport and the </p>
<p>International Zone because of the increases – and sustained – threat on Route </p>
<p>Irish, and the requirement to provide enhanced IED ‘top&#8209;cover’ have together </p>
<p>compounded the situation. The matter is compounded further by shortcomings in the </p>
<p>contracted servicing of mission critical equipment … JHF(I) has struggled to meet its </p>
<p>tasks even with rigorous prioritisation. There are several factors that exacerbate the </p>
<p>problem but it is apparent that the UK’s BH [battlefield helicopter] force is stretched </p>
<p>to meet the requirement of the current operation.” </p>
<p><b>1014. </b> The DOC quoted Maj Gen Dutton’s assertion from his Hauldown Report </p>
<p>that more helicopters were urgently needed in theatre and added that, with the </p>
<p>“significant deployment to Afghanistan”, that situation was “predicted to worsen </p>
<p>throughout 2006”. That highlighted “the serious overall shortcomings in the UK’s </p>
<p>battlefield helicopter capacity”. </p>
<p><b>1015. </b> The DOC report stated: “There is an urgent requirement to assess and improve </p>
<p>our BH capacity as an operational priority in the short and medium term.”</p>
<p><b>Force Protection Engineering (FPE)</b></p>
<p>The Directorate of Operational Capability (DOC) report on 4 April 2006 stated that </p>
<p>FPE should be viewed in relation to investment in protected mobility and counter IED. </p>
<p>It highlighted data from PJHQ that indicated that 24 percent of all attacks had been </p>
<p>against camps and other static locations, resulting in 44 percent of all wounded in action.</p>
<p>The DOC explained that, to that date, FPE expertise had resided largely in Northern </p>
<p>Ireland. Technical designs and construction standards had then been provided to other </p>
<p>theatres (including Iraq) for implementation. Additional FPE Research and Development </p>
<p>(R&amp;D) was funded by the Equipment Capability Customer but the two strands were “not </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinated”. </p>
<p>There was “an enduring need to provide security forces (and other government </p>
<p>departments when required) with secure and protected operating bases from which they </p>
<p>can effectively control the ground and interface with the indigenous population”. The need </p>
<p>for an “appropriately resourced FPE capability (for the Land environment)” had been </p>
<p>endorsed by the Executive Committee of the Army Board.</p>
<p>The DOC recommended: “Short term action is required to fill the funding gap for FPE </p>
<p>development and in the longer term, policy must be developed to ensure that FPE is </p>
<p>brought into core business post Northern Ireland ‘Normalisation.’”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>1016. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the DOC Report on 4 April 2006.</p>
<p>537</p>
<p> The lessons </p>
<p>about counter IED, ISTAR and air transport capability were repeated in the minutes.</p>
<p><b>1017. </b> The Chiefs discussed ISTAR further, the minutes recording that if the report’s </p>
<p>identification of a serious ISTAR capability gap was “true”, it would need “to be </p>
<p>addressed, possibly through the UOR process, but perhaps more realistically by </p>
<p>reviewing and adjusting as necessary the overall surveillance plan”.</p>
<p><b>1018. </b> The minutes stated that not only was ISTAR critical for operations in Afghanistan, </p>
<p>but “a lack of surveillance capability had constrained operations in MND(SE) and would </p>
<p>be critical for maintaining situational awareness in MND(SE) during strategic overwatch”. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the US was “being pressed to provide the UK with a proportional share </p>
<p>of their Predator surveillance output, given that the UK contributed a significant amount” </p>
<p>of the operating costs.</p>
<p><b>1019. </b> In discussion the Chiefs of Staff agreed that:</p>
<p>“… appropriate priority and resources were being given to the development of </p>
<p>national Counter Improvised Explosive Device capability … including the possible </p>
<p>use of the UOR process, the criticality of gaps in the UK’s surveillance plan for both </p>
<p>Iraq and Afghanistan … required further analysis, and CDS [Gen Walker] asked </p>
<p>VCDS [Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman] to scope the issue.”</p>
<p><b>1020. </b> As “a first step”, Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman wrote to Lt Gen Houghton and </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fulton on 7 April.</p>
<p>538</p>
<p> He requested Lt Gen Houghton’s ISTAR assessment for Iraq </p>
<p>and Afghanistan, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What is the requirement now, what are the shortfalls, how <i>critical </i>are they, and </p>
<p>what is being done to ameliorate them?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Given the shift to Operational Overwatch in Iraq and the UK’s enduring </p>
<p>commitment in Afghanistan, what was the “projected requirement likely to be” </p>
<p>and might it even increase when there were fewer boots on the ground? What </p>
<p>plans were in place to address these?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“How coalition/alliance assets may realistically be able to assist.”</p>
<p><b>1021. </b> Looking at how gaps could be filled, Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman suggested </p>
<p>Lt Gen Houghton should consider “the full range of potential solutions”, including </p>
<p>Merlin Mk1F and attack helicopters.</p>
<p><b>1022. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman wrote that ISTAR had also been raised during a </p>
<p>meeting about Afghanistan on 4 April and Gen Walker had “accepted that any new </p>
<p>substantial request for UOR funding in relation to Predator B should not be pursued </p>
<p>for the moment”. </p>

<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>1023. </b> Given that discussion, Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman asked Lt Gen Fulton to consider </p>
<p>what could realistically be delivered “to address known and projected shortfalls in the </p>
<p>timescales we are talking about”.</p>
<p><b>1024. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman sent a copy of the DOC report to Mr Ingram on 21 April, </p>
<p>noting that the Chiefs of Staff’s discussion of the report was based “almost exclusively </p>
<p>around the issue of re&#8209;addressing our operational ISTAR capabilities”.</p>
<p>539</p>
<p><b>1025. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman wrote that it would have implications in both Afghanistan </p>
<p>and Iraq and that “resolution of this issue always came back to operational priorities </p>
<p>within a limited Departmental budget”. Despite that, ISTAR remained an “<i>enduring</i>” </p>
<p>lesson that had been raised in all three DOC reports.</p>
<p><b>1026. </b> On 10 May, Air Commodore Nick Gordon, Director Directorate of Equipment </p>
<p>Capability (ISTAR), advised Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman on the possibility of using Predator B </p>
<p>to address shortfalls in UK ISTAR capability.</p>
<p>540</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1027. </b> Air Cdre Gordon stated that from “a standing start” it would take 24 months before </p>
<p>a Predator B could be fielded in theatre. In 2005, the DEC ISTAR team had investigated </p>
<p>procuring a demonstrator for trial in Afghanistan but, at a cost of around £60m, it was </p>
<p>deemed unaffordable within the available equipment funding. He also advised that </p>
<p>“alternative approaches” to procurement and platform operation could reduce cost and </p>
<p>time boundaries.</p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Lt Gen Houghton produced his assessment of ISTAR shortfalls on operations on </p>
<p>18 May.</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> He explained that FMV was “probably the most widely sought” ISR capability </p>
<p>in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>1029. </b> For both theatres, Lt Gen Houghton explained that the UK operated within </p>
<p>a coalition management process that afforded the UK “relatively low priority” for the </p>
<p>allocation of ISTAR assets. The agreement to provide MND(SE) with “12 hours of </p>
<p>daily Predator Feed” had been a “recurrent topic of bilateral discussion over the past </p>
<p>few months” but it was unlikely that there would be any significant change to the UK’s </p>
<p>apportionment. Any allocation of US Predator should be regarded as “a bonus” and, </p>
<p>if the UK concluded it was needed, it should aspire to acquire its own.</p>
<p><b>1030. </b> Lt Gen Houghton stated that MND(SE) had sought to offset the lack of US </p>
<p>Predator support by generating other FMV feeds. The FMV requirements were satisfied </p>
<p>in part with theatre&#8209;level manned platforms but MND(SE) could not fully exploit that </p>
<p>capability due to a lack of ground terminals to download the data. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>1031. </b> FMV coverage therefore remained “the most significant ISR gap in MND(SE)”. </p>
<p>In “general terms”, the UK was “50 percent” short of the requirement across both theatres.</p>
<p><b>1032. </b> Addressing Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman’s specific questions on attack helicopters </p>
<p>and Merlin Mk1, Lt Gen Houghton stated that attack helicopters would have “some </p>
<p>utility as an ISTAR platform” but could not distribute imagery to other users. The Merlin </p>
<p>Mk1 would be a capable platform, with some modifications, but “these debates” needed </p>
<p>closure in the context of “a comprehensive analysis of our aviation capability gaps”. </p>
<p><b>1033. </b> In the short term, Lt Gen Houghton would pursue an extension of Nimrod MR2 </p>
<p>support for Afghanistan and support the procurement or loan of terminals from the US </p>
<p>to receive FMV feeds in theatre. His staff would continue to “press for greater access to </p>
<p>Predator coverage” and he believed “we should look again at bridging the gap between </p>
<p>Phoenix OSD and Watchkeeper ISD, potentially with an extension of the former”.</p>
<p><b>1034. </b> Lt Gen Houghton stated that the identification of ISTAR requirements and </p>
<p>critical shortfalls for the medium term had proved “more problematic”. It was clear </p>
<p>that the UK was “only beginning to develop a full understanding of the national ISTAR </p>
<p>requirements for transition in both theatres” and the ways in which they could be met. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Houghton wrote:</p>
<p>“I am led to the judgement that the complexity of a Coalition and national ISTAR </p>
<p>architecture requires a dedicated MOD led ISTAR review to fully examine emerging </p>
<p>requirements … Such a review should draw together a pan&#8209;agency solution to </p>
<p>address our current shortfalls and define our long term goal for the provision of </p>
<p>a coherent Defence&#8209;wide ISTAR capability.”</p>
<p><b>The Lynx helicopter crash, 6 May 2006</b></p>
<p>On 6 May, a Lynx helicopter crashed in Basra, killing all five personnel</p>

<p> on board.</p>
<p>543</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 10 May, it was noted that “the FCO had suspended </p>
<p>flights by its personnel whilst the cause of the helicopter crash was investigated but </p>
<p>military flights continued subject to the revision of tactics, techniques and procedures”.</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>The Board of Inquiry into the crash concluded that the helicopter had been shot down by </p>

<p>Brigadier James Everard, Commander 20 Armoured Brigade, explained the effect </p>
<p>this had: </p>
<p>“The successful attack on the Lynx … resulted in the cessation of all daytime … </p>
<p>movement over Basra City. Critically, the Brigade was therefore unable to conduct </p>

<p> </p>

<p>“… I do have some concerns as I look ahead over the balance of the year … </p>
<p>If we are to match the wider campaign desire for a decisive six months we need </p>
<p>to balance ourselves accordingly.”</p>
<p>547</p>
<p><b>1036. </b> The elements of that balancing included protected mobility and ISTAR. He wrote:</p>
<p>“Resolve the issue of ISTAR. A plan that depends upon intelligence&#8209;led precision </p>

<p>176</p>
<p><b>1039. </b> On 12 June, Lt Gen Houghton wrote to Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman summarising the </p>
<p>operational requirement for battlefield helicopters in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>550</p>
<p> While there </p>
<p>was an endorsed requirement for an uplift in support to Afghanistan, on Iraq he wrote:</p>
<p>“At present there is no endorsed requirement for an increase in BH [battlefield </p>
<p>helicopters] support to Op TELIC, but operations have been constrained at times </p>
<p>by a lack of available BH support. This is partly related to the limited performance </p>
<p>and reliability of the Sea King Mk4 when compared with larger and more modern </p>
<p>BH. Any potential benefits from transition in Op TELIC may be fully absorbed </p>
<p>by emerging requirements to support Operational Overwatch and OGDs [Other </p>
<p>Government Departments].”</p>
<p><b>1040. </b> Lt Gen Houghton added that the withdrawal of Italian forces in Iraq “could present </p>
<p>an additional requirement for battlefield helicopter lift and ISTAR in Dhi Qar Province”. </p>
<p>Further work was being done to define that.</p>
<p><b>1041. </b> Lt Gen Houghton concluded:</p>
<p>“With no reductions on the horizon in Op TELIC and escalating requirements in </p>
<p>Op HERRICK, our national aviation requirements now need departmental scrutiny to </p>
<p>determine the concurrent requirement to resource both theatres and define how our </p>
<p>national aviation resources should be realigned.”</p>

<p>ACM Stirrup’s “O Group” meeting on 16 June stated in relation to Iraq:</p>
<p>“The UK required its own persistent surveillance capability if it was to deliver mission </p>
<p>success. CDS’ clear preference was for an ‘off the shelf’ solution which could be </p>

<p><b>1044. </b> On 29 June, Air Commodore Brian Bates, Director Directorate of Joint Capability, </p>
<p>produced two papers for Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman; one on rotary wing operational </p>
<p>shortfalls and one on ISTAR operational shortfalls.</p>
<p><b>1045. </b> The paper on rotary wing shortfalls stated:</p>
<p>“The Department’s BH [battlefield helicopter] capability is a finite resource that is </p>
<p>required to support a number of concurrent Military Tasks overseas and a variety </p>
<p>of Standing Home commitments. Currently the BH force is heavily committed on </p>
<p>operations and is recognised as a Defence pinch point …”</p>
<p>“A range of factors have contributed to the current pressures on the BH force; not </p>
<p>least, a legacy of underinvestment in BH sustainability and the fact that a significant </p>
<p>proportion of BH fleets are operating in excess of DPAs [Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions]. The enduring nature of today’s operations, allied to a presumed need </p>
<p>for BH during any drawdown or overwatch period, suggests that this situation is </p>
<p>unlikely to change in the medium term. Other complicating factors include: … the </p>
<p>increased IED threat that had led to a tendency to revert to the use of helicopters as </p>
<p>the default option for protection where other means, such as properly protected road </p>
<p>moves, may be possible; and, a paucity of ISTAR assets, leading to an increased </p>
<p>demand on BH platforms.”</p>
<p>553</p>
<p><b>1046. </b> The paper went on to summarise the operational requirements in each theatre. </p>
<p>For Operation TELIC it stated:</p>
<p>“Five Merlin …, three Sea King .., four Lynx …, and 3 [Helicopter] (Broadsword </p>
<p>[ISTAR]) are currently deployed on Op TELIC. The CABHWG [Capability Area </p>
<p>Battlefield Helicopter Working Group], drawing on PJHQ&#8209;led AFLRs [Aviation </p>
<p>Force Level Reviews], has established that current support is sufficient for the </p>
<p>task. This was subsequently confirmed by CJO, although circumstances that could </p>
<p>necessitate an increase in BH have been identified. The early stages of transition to </p>
<p>Operational Overwatch (OOW) may free up some lift but this is likely to be absorbed </p>
<p>by emerging tasks in support of OOW forces, OGDs and the need to maintain </p>
<p>situational awareness …”</p>
<p><b>1047. </b> The ISTAR paper stated that the key shortfall in FMV was “likely to increase </p>
<p>rather than diminish” with the move to Operational Overwatch and the evolving concept </p>
<p>of operations in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>554</p>
<p> Without additional resources, the opportunities to </p>
<p>make substantial improvements to the delivery of ISTAR on operations were limited </p>
<p>to “process enhancements” or securing greater access to coalition assets.</p>

<p><b>1048. </b> The paper continued:</p>
<p>“ISTAR issues are often inextricably linked to a multitude of other lines of </p>
<p>development or capabilities, which may, in turn, also be pinchpoints and subject </p>
<p>to considerable pressure; helicopters are a prime example. Equally, the solution </p>
<p>may not be equipment based. Rather it might be process or enabler specific. For </p>
<p>example, access to existing information, bandwidth or capability through exploitation </p>
<p>of frequency, downlink or a particular National/Coalition product or database.”</p>
<p><b>1049. </b> The options for mitigating short&#8209;term shortfalls were broken down into five areas, </p>
<p>recognising that getting ISTAR right required more than a suite of dedicated ISTAR </p>
<p>assets, but that it relied upon “all aspects of the network&#8209;enabled capability”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Improving processes for collecting, storing and processing intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Improving access to coalition capability such as the CJPTF. Lt Gen Houghton </p>
<p>had been tasked separately with improving apportionment, co&#8209;ordination and </p>
<p>liaison with US and other MNF forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Re&#8209;apportionment of national assets including: the deployment of Northern </p>
<p>Ireland based Islanders to Iraq or Afghanistan; increasing the number of </p>
<p>Defender aircraft; increasing the number of Nimrod MR2, although those were </p>
<p>unlikely to become available before November 2006; UOR action to bring Merlin </p>
<p>Mk1 up to “theatre&#8209;entry standard”; and redeploying Phoenix to Iraq after the </p>
<p>summer – an option that would have “painful implications” for a UAV regiment </p>
<p>in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Extant and emerging UORs: a USUR had been submitted and endorsed by </p>
<p>PJHQ for the provision of a “long range, long loiter, real time FMV surveillance </p>
<p>system” in May. That was similar to the USUR produced in April 2003 that led to </p>
<p>the CJPTF. Further action was awaiting the outcome of Lt Gen Houghton’s work </p>
<p>on getting greater access to coalition capability. Other UORs were in train to </p>
<p>address the lack of ground terminals able to downlink ISTAR data. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>New capabilities: options included fitting additional Defender aircraft with the </p>
<p>necessary sensors and downlink capability; further increasing the number </p>
<p>of ground ISTAR terminals; using commercially owned UAV systems such </p>
<p>as the US had done with Scan Eagle which could deliver capability quickly </p>
<p>(“within about nine months”) but did raise liability issues; advancing commercial </p>
<p>off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf UAVs such as Predator B under the DABINETT programme or </p>
<p>leasing Hermes 450/Hermes 180 air vehicles. There was no potential to bring </p>
<p>forward elements of the Watchkeeper programme. </p>
<p><b>1050. </b> Future equipment programmes would deliver improved ISTAR effect within the </p>
<p>next few years, but none before November 2006.</p>

<p><b>1051. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that Phoenix was withdrawn from theatre in June 2006 </p>
<p>and, although it had been suggested that it might be redeployed that September, it did </p>
<p>not re&#8209;enter service.</p>
<p>555</p>
<p><b>1052. </b> In July, Gen Dannatt wrote to Gen Jackson about “four major concerns” he had </p>
<p>as “the Force provider”.</p>
<p>556</p>
<p> His “first and overriding concern” was protected mobility which </p>
<p>is addressed earlier in this Section. Two of those other concerns related to ISTAR and </p>
<p>battlefield helicopters.</p>
<p><b>1053. </b> Gen Dannatt wrote that he shared Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman’s concern about </p>
<p>ISTAR support for land operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He stated that there was </p>
<p>“an urgent need for a full estimate process to ascertain the requirement” and judged </p>
<p>that “such an estimate would identify the need for an easily deployable UAV capable of </p>
<p>operating beyond the line of sight, under the control of the tactical ground commander, </p>
<p>and responsive to his information requirements”.</p>
<p><b>1054. </b> Gen Dannatt saw this “as complementary to the more immediate re&#8209;allocation </p>
<p>of current resources and longer&#8209;term Equipment Programme solutions. Such a capability </p>
<p>was always within the original vision for the Watchkeeper programme; the need is </p>
<p>now acute.”</p>
<p><b>1055. </b> Gen Dannatt acknowledged that the paper on battlefield helicopters would be </p>
<p>considered by the Chiefs of Staff that week but wrote that he “would be remiss if I failed </p>
<p>to stress the importance of resolving this issue as a matter of urgency”. He stated:</p>
<p>“Operational experience continues to drive home the inextricable linkages </p>
<p>between ISTAR, protected mobility and BH. When the two former capabilities are </p>
<p>under stress … we invariably place a higher call on the latter, a call that we find </p>
<p>increasingly difficult to meet, given the limited resources at our disposal. The issue </p>
<p>is one of flying hours as well as the provision of sufficient numbers of aircraft and </p>
<p>their spares. The key and developing role of AH [attack helicopters] on operations </p>
<p>in Afghanistan, coupled with significant shortfalls in support funding, brings this into </p>
<p>even sharper focus.”</p>
<p><b>1056. </b> Gen Dannatt wrote that action was urgently needed to continue operations and </p>
<p>“minimise casualties to our soldiers”. He stated: “Process must not be allowed to stand </p>
<p>in the way.”</p>
<p><b>1057. </b> On 4 July, the Chiefs of Staff discussed the papers on rotary wing and ISTAR </p>
<p>operational shortfalls.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>1058. </b> The minutes of the meeting recorded:</p>
<p>“In the short term, pressure on Rotary Wing (RW) assets in Afghanistan and Iraq </p>
<p>could only be alleviated by releasing assets from other tasks, or by extracting </p>
<p>more from the assets in theatre. The situation was complicated by differences </p>
<p>between helicopters in lift and Defensive Aids Suites (DAS) … In addition the paper </p>
<p>recognised that any increase in helicopter flying hours would be limited by the </p>
<p>availability of spares, crew hours and harmony guidelines …”</p>
<p><b>1059. </b> In discussion, ACM Stirrup stressed that the Chiefs of Staff “needed to focus </p>
<p>on the problem they faced between now and the end of the year. The UK was fighting </p>
<p>a war in two theatres which demanded urgent innovative work to deliver capability </p>
<p>quickly, rather than waiting for a 100 percent (or even 80 percent) solution over a longer </p>
<p>timeframe.”</p>
<p><b>1060. </b> Amongst the measures agreed by the Chiefs of Staff were taking greater risk </p>
<p>on other operations to release assets for use in Iraq and Afghanistan and taking </p>
<p>“further action with our Allies” to ensure that their helicopter assets remained in theatre, </p>
<p>specifically the US and Italians.</p>
<p><b>1061. </b> The Chiefs of Staff also agreed that additional resources were to be identified </p>
<p>in the next planning round to deliver an improved rotary wing capability. That would </p>
<p>include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “fix to field” requirement for the eight Chinook Mk3s (see Box, ‘The eight </p>
<p>modified Chinooks’);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of Defensive Aids Suites across the deployable helicopter fleet </p>
<p>so that it was “adaptable to the changing threat”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support helicopter lift over the next five years; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support helicopter and attack helicopter sustainability over the next five years.</p>
<p><b>1062. </b> On ISTAR the Chiefs agreed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Merlin Mk1 should replace Nimrod in Oman, freeing Nimrod to “ameliorate </p>
<p>ISTAR shortfalls elsewhere”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Predator B “represented the most coherent ISTAR capability for the UK’s needs” </p>
<p>and should be procured “as soon as possible” for use in Afghanistan, but without </p>
<p>prejudice to the Watchkeeper programme; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a PJHQ&#8209;led ISTAR Task Team should identify theatre&#8209;specific ISTAR </p>
<p>requirements and how the UK might better utilise the entire coalition theatre </p>
<p>ISTAR process. Air Marshal Stuart Peach, Chief of Defence Intelligence, would </p>
<p>lead that work with a view to informing the EP/STP07 by 1 October 2006.</p>
<p><b>1063. </b> ACM Stirrup asked Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman to produce an action plan to deliver </p>
<p>the measures agreed on rotary wing and ISTAR “as a matter of urgency” by 7 July. </p>

<p><b>1064. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman produced those plans on 7 July.</p>
<p>558</p>
<p> His covering minute </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“a.  Nothing is to get in the way of achieving the timetables shown, whatever the </p>
<p>hours – we are at war in two theatres and lives depend on the capabilities being </p>
<p>delivered on time. If seemingly insuperable issues arise I am to be informed </p>
<p>immediately.</p>
<p>b.  Planning <i>aficionados</i> will spot that we are departing from the programme in </p>
<p>some areas – intentionally. Less than perfect solutions are sometimes required </p>
<p>to attend to immediate needs, albeit at the expense of other projects.</p>
<p>c.  In the slightly longer term context of EP07 we shall need to make adjustments </p>
<p>to reflect the current scene, notably in the RW (DAS for far more of the fleet) </p>
<p>and ISTAR realms – DCDS(EC) [Lt Gen Fulton] will handle this and will issue </p>
<p>guidance by the end of this month.”</p>
<p><b>1065. </b> The plan to address helicopter shortfalls included releasing assets by </p>
<p>“rationalising aviation support” to counter&#8209;terrorism operations in the UK and releasing </p>
<p>helicopters from other theatres, both of which were planned to be complete by the end </p>
<p>of July 2006. Equipping all battlefield helicopters to “theatre&#8209;entry standard” was listed </p>
<p>as a 2007 Equipment Programme measure.</p>
<p><b>1066. </b> The plan to address ISTAR shortfalls included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>fully replacing Nimrod MR2 with Merlin Mk1 in Oman by the end of September;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>delivering Predator B to Afghanistan by 1 May 2007 (noting the potential loss </p>
<p>of other projects within the Equipment Programme);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assessing the requirement for a short&#8209;range tactical UAV by the end of July and </p>
<p>exploring options to meet any confirmed requirement by 15 September 2006;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reviewing the output of CJPTF by 31 July;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deploying Oakbank</p>
<p>559</p>
<p> to Iraq by 15 August;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expediting delivery of 26 ground terminals to receive coalition FMV feed, 18 of </p>
<p>which were to go to Iraq, between July 2006 and March 2007 depending on the </p>
<p>time needed to obtain an export licence; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>capturing the national requirements via an ISTAR Task Team by 31 August. </p>
<p>It would cover Iraq and Afghanistan but also take account of other commitments </p>

<p><b>1067. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman visited Iraq and Afghanistan between 9 and 13 July.</p>
<p>560</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Iraq, he reported that ISTAR and helicopters remained “the key focus” for equipment.</p>
<p><b>1068. </b> In July 2006, in his post&#8209;operation tour report, Maj Gen Cooper wrote that, </p>
<p>in relation to the UK’s understanding of militia groupings: </p>
<p>“The paucity of specialist ISTAR capability is also a concern. In order to prosecute </p>
<p>routine operations more effectively and specific strike operations accurately we need </p>
<p>better or additional UAV capability, full&#8209;motion video [and] geo&#8209;location equipment … </p>
<p>capabilities are available on the market and would be real value for money.”</p>
<p>561</p>
<p><b>1069. </b> Major General Richard Shirreff, the new GOC MND(SE), wrote in his first report </p>
<p>on 21 July about two recent “significant operational successes”.</p>
<p>562</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“… we have been lucky not to take more casualties … The message is that we </p>
<p>cannot rely on luck and that the critical shortage of key enablers exposes our </p>
<p>soldiers to significant risk. Despite the good work done by the Nimrod MR2 and </p>
<p>the two [Helicopter] Broadsword, we are woefully short of airborne surveillance </p>
<p>capability. We are unable to strike with precision from the air, which we emphatically </p>
<p>need to do, without attack helicopters or a similar capability.” </p>
<p><b>1070. </b> Forwarding the report to No. 10, Mr Browne’s Private Office wrote that it raised:</p>
<p>“… a number of issues that have subsequently been discussed in the Defence </p>

<p>183</p>
<p><b>1074. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman responded on 7 September.</p>
<p>567</p>
<p> He wrote that it was </p>
<p>worth recognising that the UK was operating above concurrency levels “(which did </p>
<p>not envisage two medium scale enduring operations over extended LOCs [Lines of </p>
<p>Communication] and did not plan for a helicopter fleet to match)”. He also stated that </p>
<p>the MOD had “postponed rectifying the acknowledged 15&#8209;20 percent helicopter shortfall </p>
<p>until at least 2010” when it had taken £1.5bn of savings against the Future Rotorcraft </p>
<p>Capability (FRC) programme in 2004.</p>
<p><b>1075. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman wrote that Lt Gen Houghton’s “current battlefield </p>
<p>helicopter requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan” were being met by the deployment </p>
<p>of additional aircraft and the resourcing of additional flying hours in both theatres. </p>
<p>That increased level of activity was, “on the face of it, sustainable” and the requirement </p>
<p>had been confirmed by the recent Force Level Review. </p>
<p><b>1076. </b> In Iraq, there was little potential for reducing the “aviation bill” in the short term.</p>
<p><b>1077. </b> The nature of both campaigns required a “critical theatre entry standard” to </p>
<p>be imposed, principally the fitting of DAS and long&#8209;range secure communications. </p>
<p>That meant, even with UORs to date, 65 percent of the battlefield helicopter fleet was </p>
<p>“not deployable”. Planned UORs would reduce that figure to 40 percent. </p>
<p><b>1078. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman stated that flying hours were limited by the availability </p>
<p>of trained crews as much as airframes. The demand was being met by “redistributing </p>
<p>airframes and sweating the assets to the maximum degree” but, he warned:</p>
<p>“There is not likely to be any let&#8209;up in BH tempo for at least the next five years which </p>
<p>leaves us with virtually no capacity to meet increased or new demands and a real </p>
<p>‘harmony’ problem for our BH people.” </p>
<p><b>1079. </b> Four options to add capability were considered:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Leasing – an option with “limited mileage” because the resolution of indemnity </p>
<p>and financing issues, coupled with delivery timescales meant that significant </p>
<p>new deployable capability would take at least a year but more likely three. </p>
<p>Leased civilian helicopters in the UK could be used for training but would not </p>
<p>generate competent crews for operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Contracting – using contractor aircraft flown by civilians was an option but the </p>
<p>aircraft were not “DAS’d to our standards”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further developments to the existing fleet – Puma was scheduled to go out of </p>
<p>service in 2010 and Sea King Mk4 in 2012. To keep both models going beyond </p>
<p>those dates would cost £155m. Options were being considered to make some </p>
<p>Merlin Mk1s “dual capable as BH” and to make other aircraft into “a basic SH”.</p>

<p>Chinook Mk3 airworthy.</p>
<p><b>The eight modified Chinooks</b></p>
<p>In 1995, the MOD ordered 14 Chinook Mk2a helicopters from Boeing: six were retained </p>
<p>as Mk2 but eight were modified as Mk3 to meet a longstanding requirement for special </p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p>571</p>
<p> Those eight helicopters cost £259m and were delivered to the MOD in </p>
<p>December 2001.</p>
<p>Although Boeing had met its contractual obligations, the avionics software fell short of UK </p>
<p>military airworthiness standards and the helicopters were left in storage while solutions </p>
<p>were considered.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Public Accounts Committee described it as “one of the worst examples of </p>
<p>equipment procurement” that it had seen.</p>
<p>Following increases in troop numbers to Afghanistan, the MOD started looking for ways to </p>
<p>increase its helicopter capacity. As a result, in March 2007, Mr Browne took the decision </p>
<p>to “revert” the Chinooks back to the Mk2 standard to make them available for use in </p>
<p>operations as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In March 2009, the Public Accounts Committee described that decision as having been </p>
<p>made in haste in “a matter of days”.</p>
<p>572</p>
<p> The MOD did not consult Boeing about the </p>
<p>risks, costs and timescales which ultimately led to a 70 percent increase in the cost of </p>
<p>the project. The final cost for the helicopters on entering service would be £422m, or </p>
<p>£52.5m each.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>1088. </b> On 11 October, Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman produced an update on helicopter and </p>
<p>ISTAR shortfalls.</p>
<p>575</p>
<p> The updates that involved Iraq were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Four additional Nimrod MR2 would be deployed in “Iraq/Afghanistan” from </p>
<p>1 November 2006 to 30 April 2007.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A business case for a mini&#8209;UAV was being developed to provide surveillance </p>
<p>capability at “company/battlegroup level” by June 2007. In parallel, MND(SE) </p>
<p>was running trials on Raven, a US system, to inform the choice.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MND(SE) had produced a USUR for a tactical UAV. DEC ISTAR had already </p>
<p>received proposals from engagement with industry and was in the process of </p>
<p>selecting the most appropriate option. The initial operating capability depended </p>
<p>on the system selected but was “likely to be around by June 2007”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The installation of a “layered and networked surveillance” capability at fixed sites </p>
<p>was moving forward.</p>
<p><b>1089. </b> Further meetings and discussions took place in October with a clear focus on </p>
<p>increasing helicopter availability, primarily in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>576</p>
<p> The only action discussed </p>
<p>in relation to Iraq was the possibility of using two of the six Danish Merlin that the UK </p>
<p>was intending to purchase to replace Sea King, with a view to modifying and redeploying </p>
<p>those Sea Kings to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>577</p>
<p><b>1090. </b> On 24 October, Mr Jonathan Lyle, Director Air and Weapons Systems, wrote to </p>
<p>Lord Drayson advising that acquiring six Danish Merlin aircraft would increase the fleet </p>
<p>of Merlin support helicopters to a total of 28 aircraft, “enabling an enduring deployment </p>
<p>of 7 Merlin and an uplift of 40 percent on those currently deployed to Op TELIC”.</p>
<p>578</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That would provide a “more robust and enduring capability than, for example, modifying </p>
<p>Merlin Mk1 aircraft”. </p>
<p><b>1091. </b> Mr Lyle wrote:</p>
<p>“Merlin is a success on Op TELIC and is the aircraft of choice for Iraq. To minimise </p>
<p>the logistic footprint within JHF(I), the JHC favour an all Merlin force in Op TELIC. </p>

<p><b>1093. </b> On 26 October, Lord Drayson and Mr Ingram wrote to Mr Browne with a joint </p>
<p>proposal on how to increase helicopter availability.</p>
<p>579</p>
<p> Their minute highlighted that </p>
<p>the issue had arisen on “the assumption that there was a shortfall of lift capability </p>
<p>in Afghanistan” but there had been “very few occasions when tasks could not be </p>
<p>supported”, and theatre had not requested additional assets.</p>
<p><b>1094. </b> Despite that, the Ministers said that the UK was “currently breaking crew harmony </p>
<p>guidelines”, and the current level of operations was unlikely to be sustainable in the </p>
<p>medium term so even if forces were not increased in Afghanistan, “action taken now </p>
<p>will improve the current situation”.</p>
<p><b>1095. </b> The measures proposed by the Ministers included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increasing Chinook flying hours in Afghanistan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>procuring new blades for Sea King Mk4s to enable them to fly in Afghanistan </p>
<p>conditions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>procuring six Danish Merlin to backfill the Sea Kings deployed in Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“leasing/buying” eight US Chinooks for Afghanistan.</p>
<p><b>1096. </b> Mr Browne approved the increase in Chinook flying hours on 10 November, </p>
<p>agreeing that the most likely requirement was for Afghanistan and for heavy lift in </p>
<p>particular.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1097. </b> Mr Browne wrote that more information was needed on the other proposals </p>
<p>to clarify how they would meet the capability gap in the short and medium term. </p>
<p>Discussions on the Danish Merlins should “slow down” until it was clear what the </p>
<p>requirement was and how it would be funded. </p>
<p><b>1098. </b> On 15 December, Brigadier James Everard, Commander 20 Armoured Brigade, </p>

<p>“With the exception of Merlin conducting IRT [Incident Response Team] operations, </p>

<p>over the contract for new Merlins built for Denmark …” </p>
<p><b>1101. </b> Addressing the effectiveness of the MOD’s response, Lord Drayson added:</p>
<p>“The Department’s response was mixed. Great efforts were made to provide </p>
<p>enhanced flying hours through the provision of trained crews, rotor&#8209;blade </p>
<p>improvements, improved defensive aid suites etc but it was difficult to get the </p>

<p>THE INCREASING THREAT OF INDIRECT FIRE ATTACKS</p>
<p><b>1104. </b> The deterioration of security in Iraq from August 2003 is referred to earlier in </p>
<p>this Section and in Section 9.2. In addition to the introduction of IEDs, there were also </p>
<p>indirect fire (IDF) attacks on Coalition Forces, using mortars, man&#8209;portable surface&#8209;to&#8209;air </p>
<p>missiles and small arms fire.</p>
<p><b>1105. </b> The solution was considered to be a combination of hardening structures and </p>
<p>improving surveillance.</p>
<p><b>1106. </b> Concerns about the safety of civilian personnel as the IDF risk increased are </p>
<p>detailed in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>1107. </b> In his post&#8209;tour report, Major General Andrew Stewart, GOC MND(SE) from </p>
<p>December 2003 to July 2004, stated:</p>
<p>“We have been extremely fortunate that we have not suffered casualties in bases </p>
<p>from indirect fire. Attacks against them are sure to increase. Hardening, in some </p>
<p>form or other, has to take place.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>1112. </b> There were four “bands” of physical protection that could be added incrementally </p>
<p>to camps to counter the IDF threat:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Compartmentalisation – found in “most camps” in Iraq and undergoing </p>
<p>“enhancement work”. Its effectiveness was partially restricted by the layout </p>
<p>of camps but overall offered 10 to 80 percent lower casualty rates.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ballistic refuge shelter – for personnel to occupy when a warning of attack was </p>
<p>given and used as accommodation during the height of the August 2004 attacks. </p>
<p>It was assessed that the shelters were “of little value” in the current improved </p>
<p>security situation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hardened temporary accommodation – provided permanently occupied, </p>
<p>purpose&#8209;built but improvised sleeping accommodation with air conditioning and </p>
<p>lighting. CITADEL was an example. Providing CITADEL for all UK troops in Iraq </p>
<p>would cost £35m, would take “in excess of 12 months” to complete and would </p>
<p>require significant amounts of logistical and construction assets. The quality and </p>
<p>comfort of CITADEL would be “significantly lower than that currently occupied” </p>
<p>and the investment in the first two bands of accommodation would be wasted.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Purpose&#8209;built protected building – not considered appropriate for use in Iraq </p>
<p>because of “cost, time to build and permanence”.</p>
<p><b>1113. </b> AM Torpy wrote that it was “possible to mitigate against the likelihood and </p>
<p>significance” of IDF attacks “through a package of mutually supporting TTPs and </p>
<p>engineering force protection measures”. He stated that events had shown that the level </p>
<p>of attacks would “oscillate”. Compartmentalisation was “suitable” protection “in light of </p>
<p>the risk across Iraq” but those measures should be “constantly reviewed” in relation to </p>
<p>changes in or development of the threat.</p>
<p><b>1114. </b> Gen Walker introduced AM Torpy’s paper at the Chiefs of Staff meeting on </p>
<p>23 March.</p>
<p>588</p>
<p> The Chiefs were invited to consider the recommendation not to introduce </p>
<p>CITADEL “in view of the risk to our forces and the degree of additional protection that </p>
<p>might be afforded by CITADELs; the length of time that UK forces will remain in Iraq; the </p>
<p>cost of procuring and setting up CITADELs; the message that might be sent by building </p>
<p>CITADELs this far into the campaign; and the consequences of an AIF [anti&#8209;Iraqi forces] </p>
<p>attack similar to that which the US have experienced”.</p>
<p><b>1115. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that: </p>
<p>“ … in view of the potential to draw down to SS [“steady state”] by mid&#8209;05, providing </p>
<p>CITADELs would mean fortifying our camps just as troops were ready to leave Iraq; </p>
<p>only if the campaign were to be drawn out would this investment be worthwhile. </p>
<p>It was also considered that fortifying camps at this stage would send the wrong </p>
<p>message to all parties and run counter to any announcements on drawdown. </p>
<p>The unanimous view was that compartmentalisation and active force protection </p>

<p>measures would provide a significant reduction in the risk to UK forces but that the </p>
<p>provision of CITADELs would not be of great benefit at this stage of the campaign.”</p>
<p><b>1116. </b> Gen Walker directed AM Torpy to prepare a Ministerial note on the force </p>
<p>protection of UK camps with “a clear explanation of both compartmentalisation and the </p>
<p>CITADEL concept” and with the statistical analysis from the trials.</p>
<p><b>1117. </b> On 30 March, a PJHQ official sent a slightly revised copy of AM Torpy’s paper </p>
<p>to Mr Hoon, asking him to note the Chiefs of Staff’s decision.</p>
<p>589</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1118. </b> The official advised Mr Hoon that the improved level of protection afforded by </p>
<p>CITADEL had been weighed against:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the relatively low frequency of and threat from indirect fire attacks”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the hazards inherent in implementing CITADEL, such as the large number of </p>
<p>predictable road movements to transport materials to each UK camp;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “perceived diminution in the quality of life that would result from insisting that </p>
<p>our troops adopt a CITADEL solution”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the investment in existing accommodation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “fact that protection is only provided […] one third of the day”.</p>
<p><b>1119. </b> On presentation, the official advised Mr Hoon that there was “a risk that, in the </p>
<p>event of a sudden and unexpected upturn in violence”, the MOD “could be accused of </p>
<p>not having done ‘everything possible’ to ensure the safety of our personnel”. The official </p>
<p>wrote that “no measures” could offer “an absolute guarantee of safety” and that force </p>
<p>protection consisted of TTPs as well as physical measures:</p>
<p>“In this case, as with most aspects of operations, we have to make a judgement on </p>
<p>what is sensible and practicable.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>with the Iraq Ministry of Interior would benefit from greater UK assistance but that was </p>
<p>determined by the physical security risk to civilian staff. He wrote:</p>
<p>“Given that the indirect fire threat seems to pose the greatest risk … our Counter </p>
<p>Indirect Fire (C&#8209;IDF) measures assume even greater importance. Hardening </p>
<p>accommodation is … one important aspect … but by no means a panacea.  </p>
<p>What is more important is to deter or defeat those who would prosecute these </p>
<p>attacks rather than rely on mitigating the consequences. And to do this we need </p>
<p>greatly improved ISTAR.</p>
<p>“This is hardly new. We have known about the paucity of UK ISTAR in both </p>
<p>operational theatres for some time now and I welcome the steps we have made with </p>
<p>Predator. But this is far from being the complete answer. We need an integrated and </p>
<p>layered approach, which provides dedicated manned and unmanned surveillance </p>
<p>capability at battlegroup, brigade and divisional level. It is imperative, therefore, that </p>
<p>we do not let the Project Watchkeeper ISD slip further to the right and we should </p>
<p>investigate the possibility of an interim contracted solution to cover the next four </p>
<p>years. Rotary wing MAS [Manned Airborne Surveillance] is equally important and we </p>
<p>should ensure Project Stockwell</p>
<p>592</p>
<p> remains adequately funded. I urge early decision </p>
<p>and action in this area.”</p>
<p><b>1123. </b> The record of actions from ACM Stirrup’s “O” Group meeting on 3 October stated:</p>
<p>“While ‘Tier 1 Enhanced’ was an acceptable level of immediate Force Protection, </p>
<p>every effort needed to be made to establish hardened bases in those areas of </p>
<p>Basra where our presence was likely for the medium term, and to minimise manning </p>
<p>commensurate with the tasks in hand.”</p>
<p>593</p>
<p><b>1124. </b> On 10 October, a PJHQ official advised Mr Browne, at his request, on the </p>
<p>implications for force protection if troops were moved to Basra Air Station (BAS).</p>
<p>594</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1125. </b> Operational analysis had indicated that there was a “negligible difference in the </p>
<p>threat posed to a larger base”. A single base would allow a concentration of anti&#8209;IDF </p>
<p>resources and reduce the need for vulnerable road moves that currently placed a drain </p>
<p>on other valuable assets, “particularly aviation”.</p>
<p><b>1126. </b> The official explained that there was a combination of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 at </p>
<p>BAS, all of which were vulnerable to overhead attack. Trials of an overhead system that </p>
<p>“may partially mitigate against shrapnel” from an overhead blast continued but in the </p>
<p>“immediate term” it was “most important to contain the lateral threat from IDF”. </p>
<p>592 </p>

<p><b>1127. </b> According to the official, this was achieved through a programme of </p>
<p>“compartmentalisation” which was under way and should be in place within seven weeks </p>
<p>for all personnel at BAS or Shaibah Logistics Base (SLB). It was estimated that that </p>
<p>would reduce the overall threat by 60 percent. </p>
<p><b>1128. </b> It would cost “approximately $130m” to replace all tented accommodation with </p>
<p>containerised accommodation throughout MND(SE) and it would take “about 12 months” </p>
<p>to complete. That would also have implications for the timeframe within which the </p>
<p>UK could withdraw from SLB. The official advised that it was “arguable whether it </p>
<p>would result in net reduction in risk to our people (though it might overcome some </p>
<p>presentational issues)”.</p>
<p><b>1129. </b> The official stated:</p>
<p>“In the longer term, anticipating an increasingly serious IDF threat and recognising </p>
<p>quality of life, we are also examining the options for providing Tier 2 or Tier 3 </p>
<p>accommodation for the enduring proportion of the force (beyond 2008). Initial work </p>
<p>indicates that hardened accommodation for a reduced force would cost some </p>
<p>$60m to implement.”</p>
<p><b>1130. </b> The official wrote that there was a need “to keep the threat posed to date by IDF </p>
<p>attacks in perspective to the wider challenges faced by MND(SE)”. There had been </p>
<p>two UK personnel</p>
<p>595</p>
<p> and one US State Department employee killed by IDF, all since </p>
<p>1 August 2006, compared with 25 fatalities by direct fire and 27 by IEDs. IEDs were still </p>
<p>considered “to be the greatest challenge”. The official advised that, despite that, “recent </p>
<p>experience” had suggested IDF attacks were “becoming more accurate”.</p>
<p><b>1131. </b> The official concluded that the incremental force protection plan in hand would: </p>
<p>“… ameliorate but not eliminate the risk. More could be done, but would mean </p>
<p>delay and significant additional cost. There is a case to be made for hardened </p>
<p>accommodation for our longer term residual presence, and work is in hand to </p>
<p>define this.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>IDF in Basra amounted to “harassing fire” by theatre standards but it had “assumed </p>
<p>strategic significance following the events at Abu Naji</p>
<p>599</p>
<p> and the civilian drawdown from </p>
<p>Basra Palace”.</p>
<p><b>1135. </b> Lt Gen Houghton reported that accommodation now had “lateral” protection </p>
<p>in place but that overhead ballistic protection would not be complete until the end of </p>
<p>June 2007 because of “a capacity issue”.</p>
<p><b>1136. </b> The ongoing efforts to counter IDF included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increased patrolling;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ISTAR and the use of attack helicopters;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the surging of [UK theatre forces]; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the potential use of a US “Sense and Warn” system.</p>
<p><b>1137. </b> In discussion the Chiefs of Staff noted:</p>
<p>“The long term corrosive effect of IDF on coalition operations in Basra, and the </p>
<p>difficulty in quantifying the potential impact of counter IDF measures in the near to </p>
<p>medium term; the critical impact of the threat on the future civilian force posture in </p>
<p>the city; and the potential opportunity afforded by planned force withdrawals from </p>
<p>Basra … to leverage local deals to reduce the IDF threat.”</p>
<p><b>1138. </b> Lt Gen Houghton was tasked with investigating options to improve the </p>
<p>procurement timelines for fixed force protection in theatre.</p>
<p><b>1139. </b> Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman visited Iraq and Afghanistan from 27 November to </p>
<p>2 December 2006.</p>
<p>600</p>
<p> One of the points about Iraq highlighted in his visit report was:</p>
<p>“The indirect fire threat needs urgent attention, not only to save life, but also </p>
<p>because it is probably a pre&#8209;condition for PIC [Provincial Iraqi Control] and an </p>
<p>essential information operations issue if the opposition is not to claim it has bombed </p>
<p>us out of Basra … Action is in hand.” </p>
<p><b>1140. </b> Separately, General Sir Redmond Watt, Commander in Chief Land, visited Iraq </p>
<p>and the Al Udeid air base in Qatar from 27 to 28 November.</p>
<p>601</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1141. </b> In Qatar, Air Commodore Clive Bairsto, Air Officer Commanding 83 Expeditionary </p>
<p>Air Group, told Gen Watt that he had “made the case” for more manned airborne </p>
<p>surveillance, particularly in Iraq where current and planned UAV deployments were </p>
<p>“more limited than Afghanistan”. </p>
<p>599 </p>
<p>UK forces handed over Camp Abu Naji in Maysan province to the Iraqi Security Forces in August 2006 </p>

<p><b>1142. </b> In Iraq, Gen Watt met Maj Gen Shirreff and reported:</p>
<p>“Richard also commented that some are making too much of the indirect fire </p>
<p>attacks in Basra, which skews perceptions in Whitehall. We should encourage other </p>
<p>government departments to see these attacks for what they are – harassing fire – </p>
<p>and get on with redevelopment …”</p>
<p><b>1143. </b> Gen Watt also remained “concerned about the paucity of ISTAR assets”:</p>
<p>“Everywhere I went I was briefed that a lack of ISTAR asset availability was </p>
<p>constraining operations. As we move towards PIC and over&#8209;watch the problem will </p>
<p>become more acute.”</p>
<p><b>1144. </b> On 14 December, a PJHQ official advised Mr Browne that three 105mm Light </p>
<p>Guns</p>
<p>602</p>
<p> would be deployed to Basra from early January 2007 at Maj Gen Shirreff’s </p>
<p>request.</p>
<p>603</p>
<p> That was in response to “a heightened and sustained IDF threat against </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Force bases in Basra City” which had resulted in the temporary </p>
<p>withdrawal of FCO and DFID personnel from Basra Palace.</p>
<p><b>1145. </b> The Light Guns would significantly enhance Maj Gen Shirreff’s options in “the </p>
<p>ongoing counter&#8209;IDF operation, augmenting the support already available such as </p>
<p>helicopter and fast air capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>1146. </b> The movements associated with the move to BAS would “temporarily increase </p>
<p>MND(SE)’s vulnerability to insurgent attack”. The official wrote: “Of critical concern are </p>
<p>the IDF threat, and the perceptions thereof of both the Iraqi people, and the MNF chain </p>
<p>of command.”</p>
<p><b>1147. </b> The official wrote that although the deployment of the guns was an enduring </p>
<p>requirement, there were no immediate resource implications.</p>
<p><b>1148. </b> Further advice from PJHQ on 20 December stated that Counter Rocket Artillery </p>
<p>and Mortar (C&#8209;RAM) “Sense and Warn” systems loaned from the US would deploy to the </p>
<p>BAS Contingency Operating Base (COB) in “late January/early February”.</p>
<p>604</p>
<p> Again, that </p>
<p>was following a request made by Maj Gen Shirreff.</p>
<p><b>1149. </b> The system “comprises a network of radars working together to provide early </p>

<p><b>1151. </b> On 15 December, Brig Everard wrote in his post&#8209;operation tour report that </p>
<p>“the IDF threat to base locations remained substantial throughout the tour”.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1152. </b> Brig Everard also wrote:</p>
<p>“Despite considerable effort we failed to win the Counter&#8209;Indirect Fire (C&#8209;IDF) battle, </p>
<p>with strategic implications as OGD [other government departments] reduced their </p>
<p>footprint.”</p>
<p><b>1153. </b> On 19 January 2007, Maj Gen Shirreff wrote in his post&#8209;operation tour report:</p>
<p>“… we have missed the boat on the ISTAR front. I commented in my first weekly </p>
<p>letter six months ago: ‘it beggars belief, that after 3 years here, the British Army </p>
<p>possesses no tactical UAV capable of flying in the heat of the summer.’ I was told </p>
<p>no more staff effort could be put into resolving the problem, but despite this it will </p>
<p>be sometime before anything is in service in theatre. Contrast this grindingly slow </p>
<p>and ponderous response to the Americans’ generous support with Raven or the </p>
<p>Australians who have shown the agility and forethought to lease 6 Scan Eagles </p>
<p>from Boeing, together with 3 ground stations … It took a couple of weeks to clear </p>
<p>the decision, two weeks to train the soldiers and Boeing technicians have deployed </p>
<p>to maintain the systems. As a result, contrast what we know about events in As </p>
<p>Samawah with what we do not know about al&#8209;Amarah. As for strike operations, more </p>
<p>than anything else, this battle is about day and night long loiter capability … tracking </p>
<p>the target – for days if necessary … then striking to detain him. This has been a </p>
<p>critical factor in the successful battle against AQI [Al Qaida in Iraq] and until we have </p>
<p>the same capability we will continue to strike relatively blind against militant JAM.</p>
<p>“If our procurement system were capable of similar agility we would have UAVs on </p>
<p>station tracking targets now.”</p>
<p>607</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1154. </b> On IDF, Maj Gen Shirreff wrote that attacks in Basra had “increased throughout </p>
<p>the year, approximately doubling every 2 to 3 months”. He added later in the report that </p>
<p>protection against IDF had “become a primary concern”.</p>
<p><b>1155. </b> Lt Gen Richard Shirreff told the Inquiry that he thought the ability to see and </p>

<p>609</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1158. </b> Lt Gen Houghton asked ACM Stirrup to note that there was a “presentational </p>
<p>difficulty” around the move to the COB because it only provided Tiers 1 and 2 level </p>
<p>protection, but that the risk should be viewed “in the context of the aggregate threat”. </p>
<p>That threat included IDF, surface&#8209;to&#8209;air missiles, IEDs, direct fire and the ability of the </p>
<p>enemy to gain information about UK vulnerabilities. The move to BAS would lead to </p>
<p>a “safer overall force posture” because UK forces would “become less exposed to the </p>
<p>most effective means of attack”, IEDs, and would allow a concentration of resources </p>
<p>to ameliorate risk.</p>
<p><b>1159. </b> Lt Gen Houghton wrote that the “most likely” way insurgents would disrupt </p>
<p>operations from the COB was through IDF. The frequency of attacks was increasing </p>
<p>and the likelihood of a successful attack had “increased to an estimated 95 percent </p>
<p>probability within the next three months”.</p>
<p><b>1160. </b> Lt Gen Houghton suggested that the most effective ways of reducing the </p>
<p>potential scale of a successful IDF attack was through physical compartmentalisation </p>
<p>of communal areas, and procedures to limit the number of people in “any given area”. </p>
<p>Existing construction work would conclude in June, but “only a move to suitable </p>
<p>protected structures” would offer “a notably higher level of protection”.</p>
<p><b>1161. </b> The priority was for Tier 3 infrastructure in communal areas:</p>
<p>“… we have decided in principle to provide hardened dining facilities (estimated at </p>
<p>$14m and 20 months to complete) and to begin expansion of our Tier 3 footprint </p>
<p>(current estimate additional $60&#8209;70m and an additional 10 months) … We should </p>
<p>now form a judgement on the cost/benefit of proceeding with a more extensive Tier 3 </p>
<p>build in the context of our enduring Overwatch posture.” </p>
<p><b>1162. </b> The use of C&#8209;RAM promised (subject to proof of capability trials) to provide “a </p>
<p>significant enhancement” to force protection, although there would be some integration </p>
<p>issues to overcome.</p>
<p><b>1163. </b> Lt Gen Houghton continued: </p>
<p>“We are not fully confident the requirement for increased persistency of ISTAR </p>
<p>coverage around the COB and over Basra City can be achieved. The UOR </p>
<p>programme to deliver TUAV [Tactical UAV] is on track to deliver an ISD of July </p>

<p>Lt Gen Houghton wrote that it made “no operational sense to be parsimonious in the </p>
<p>provision of ISTAR” when it was such an important element of force protection.</p>
<p><b>1165. </b> Lt Gen Houghton concluded:</p>
<p>“We cannot guarantee absolute FP [force protection] integrity or the complete </p>

<p><b>An interim UAV solution – Scan Eagle </b></p>
<p>On 17 January 2007, Vice Admiral Charles Style, DCDS(C), briefed the Chiefs of Staff on </p>
<p>his impressions from a recent visit to Iraq, including that the “critical lack” of tactical UAVs </p>
<p>in MND(SE) “could have a significant effect over the forthcoming period”.</p>
<p>611</p>
<p>On 12 March, VAdm Style gave Lord Drayson an update on attempts to address the </p>
<p>tactical UAV capability gap as part of advice to the Minister ahead of his visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>612</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following discussions with the Australian Department of Defence, a solution had been </p>
<p>agreed whereby the UK would lease Scan Eagle from the Australian Defence Force. </p>
<p>It would be available from April 2007 to 30 June 2007 at a cost of £4.12m and the option </p>
<p>to extend the contract beyond June remained open.</p>
<p>Leasing additional UAV capability through Scan Eagle had been identified as “the only </p>
<p>option” that would deliver ahead of the initial operating capability of Hermes 450 and avoid </p>
<p>the delays associated with other options.</p>
<p>A minute to Lord Drayson on 19 April confirmed that the Scan Eagle initial operating </p>
<p>capability was achieved on 15 April 2007 and PJHQ had endorsed the requirement to </p>
<p>extend the contract until November 2007.</p>
<p>613</p>
<p> Lord Drayson was advised:</p>
<p>“The original requirement … to provide Operational and Formation level airborne </p>
<p>ISTAR capability for MND(SE) remains extant and is not met or replaced by this </p>
<p>proposal. In order to meet pressing requirements and cover operations during the </p>

<p> He wrote that IDF was responsible </p>
<p>for “inflicting the second highest number of casualties against the UK after IEDs” and the </p>
<p>threat was likely to increase when UK forces re&#8209;postured to the COB. </p>
<p><b>1167. </b> Physical protection measures were “approaching their practical limit” until a </p>
<p>Tier 3 solution was delivered and Maj Gen Shirreff had reported that IDF was “having </p>
<p>a detrimental psychological effect on our troops”.</p>
<p><b>1168. </b> Mr Ingram replied on 19 February, agreeing that the extra weapons could be </p>
<p>deployed.</p>
<p>615</p>
<p><b>1169. </b> In a Force Level Review on 26 February, Lt Gen Houghton advised that there </p>
<p>was “scope to re&#8209;task” up to two Sea King helicopters to other operations by mid&#8209;June </p>
<p>because of “MND(SE) force dispositions and Merlin SH capacity”.</p>
<p>616</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1170. </b> Lt Gen Houghton suggested that the four remaining Sea King helicopters would </p>
<p>be dedicated to ISTAR, but it might be possible to withdraw some of them with the arrival </p>
<p>of other UAVs anticipated later in the year, including Hermes 450 in mid&#8209;June. </p>
<p><b>1171. </b> Lt Gen Houghton wrote that “the very best case ISD” for the UK C&#8209;RAM capability </p>
<p>to protect the COB was 31 May and it seemed “highly likely” to slip. He added: “The </p>
<p>battle procedure to deliver this is ongoing and the system will require up to 100 </p>
<p>personnel to support it.”</p>
<p><b>1172. </b> On 7 March, Mr Browne sent “a personal memo” to Mr Ingram and Lord Drayson </p>

<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“IDF is an issue we have all been aware of, and striving to address, for some months </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>1174. </b> Mr Browne acknowledged that, for more to be done, “people need some </p>
<p>guidance within which to work, particularly in relation to timescales and force levels”. </p>
<p>He suggested agreement on the following assumptions:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>current plans for force levels and posture will hold for the next six months;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for the period 6&#8209;12 months from now we will be at 4,500 in COB only;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for the period 12&#8209;24 months from now we will be at 3,000 in COB only.”</p>
<p><b>1175. </b> Mr Browne wrote:</p>
<p>“I would welcome rapid agreement from all parties on this. Once agreed I am content </p>
<p>we programme on this basis, including finance, accepting that it is a planning </p>
<p>assumption for the purposes of this exercise alone.”</p>
<p><b>1176. </b> Mr Browne questioned whether hardened accommodation for communal areas </p>
<p>could be delivered earlier than the estimated timescale of 16&#8209;20 months and whether </p>
<p>shorter&#8209;term improvements could be made in the interim: “3&#8209;6 months, preferably </p>
<p>sooner”. Options for different timings and costs should be provided quickly, “disregarding </p>
<p>bureaucracy and standard assumptions about financial constraints”.</p>
<p><b>1177. </b> Mr Browne wrote that the Phalanx capability</p>
<p>618</p>
<p> was “a major step in the right </p>
<p>direction” and that they should do “everything in our power, including Ministerial </p>
<p>intervention with the US” to meet the May timescale. He asked whether that should </p>
<p>be pursued for Basra Palace as well as the COB.</p>
<p><b>1178. </b> Lord Drayson visited Iraq on 8 March and discussed various equipment issues </p>
<p>in theatre, including force protection.</p>
<p>619</p>
<p> His report is detailed earlier in this Section with </p>
<p>regard to how the UOR process worked in Iraq and protected mobility.</p>
<p><b>1179. </b> Lord Drayson was informed by 19 Light Brigade that Merlin was performing well, </p>
<p>“although it was not yet hot”. The Lynx helicopters were unable to fly in the summer heat </p>
<p>in Iraq and the top cover role they provided for convoys could be filled with a UAV. </p>
<p><b>1180. </b> The visit report stated that, after visiting Basra Rural South Brigade:</p>
<p>“It was made very clear that the IDF was having a significant impact on the morale of </p>
<p>forces based at the COB … The element of chance in where IDF landed significantly </p>
<p>increased stress level, and two people had already been sent home as a result.”</p>
<p><b>1181. </b> Lord Drayson had been told that there was no off&#8209;the&#8209;shelf design for hardened </p>
<p>accommodation that could be applied and that there were challenges to building in </p>
<p>Iraq. If “process impediments” were removed, then the first hardened buildings could </p>
<p>“probably be in place in around 10 months”. The US presently took 7&#8209;8 months to build </p>
<p>hardened accommodation.</p>

<p><b>1182. </b> In the meantime, theatre was about to subdivide dining areas, which would </p>
<p>reduce the threat of a mass casualty event, and the US Sense and Warn system was </p>
<p>“seen as a real positive” for the warning time it provided.</p>
<p><b>1183. </b> Lord Drayson had been told how FMV surveillance was “crucial to situational </p>
<p>awareness and counter IDF operations” but the UK was reliant on US assets.  </p>
<p>The US had recently withdrawn Apache helicopters from Basra as they had not “been </p>
<p>used kinetically”. </p>
<p><b>1184. </b> Lord Drayson’s report stated:</p>
<p>“Overall there was a clear perception in theatre that UK MOD was not taking account </p>
<p>of the rate of change. UORs too often sought to deliver a perfect capability, but in </p>
<p>doing so delivered so late the requirement had changed or theatre were without any </p>
<p>capability for too long. It was suggested that if there were greater dialogue between </p>
<p>theatre and the ECC/ABW [Equipment Capability Customer/Abbey Wood</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>] on </p>
<p>individual UORs then trades … could be made. The example quoted was of UAVs. </p>
<p>Hermes was seen as a Rolls Royce solution to a requirement that would now be met </p>
<p>(in a bridging capacity) by Scan Eagle, and might better have been met sooner in </p>
<p>that way. Equally deployment of the Desert Hawk UAV was being delayed by the UK </p>
<p>approach to airworthiness,</p>
<p>621</p>
<p> and the Raven system might have been bought more </p>
<p>quickly. It was felt that more visits from DECs and IPTs would help …”</p>
<p><b>1185. </b> Lord Drayson met the Commander of JHF&#8209;I and the aircrew:</p>
<p>“This was a sobering meeting with the aircrew clearly very busy … and with a </p>
<p>number of concerns about their equipment and the levels of support.”</p>
<p><b>1186. </b> Some of the concerns raised were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sea King was fundamentally an old aircraft and the lift capability it provided </p>
<p>declined in the summer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With Lynx and Merlin, there was a problem of spares supply and the DSPs </p>
<p>for Merlin were still unfunded.</p>
<p><b>1187. </b> The report ended:</p>
<p>“Lord Drayson would be grateful for advice from DCDS(EC) on what can be done to </p>
<p>improve communication between UK and theatre, and for him and CDM to reinforce </p>
<p>the urgency that everyone should attach to delivering UORs.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>Upgrading battlefield helicopters to “theatre entry </b></p>
<p><b>standard”</b></p>
<p>Following his visit to Iraq in March 2007, Lord Drayson sought advice on why a proposal </p>
<p>to equip more helicopters to “Theatre Entry Standard” had been deferred.</p>
<p>622</p>
<p>An MOD official reported on 12 March that the Defence Management Board (DMB) </p>
<p>had reserved decisions on a package of savings and enhancements until after the </p>
<p>Comprehensive Spending Review was settled. The package included the option </p>
<p>“to equip more battlefield helicopters with theatre entry equipment” at a cost of £260m </p>
<p>over 10 years. </p>
<p>Further advice sent to Lord Drayson on 16 March explained that the proposal was to </p>
<p>upgrade 10 Chinook, 3 Apache, 11 Lynx, 8 Merlin and 17 Sea King.</p>
<p>623</p>
<p> The increase in </p>
<p>capability was estimated to take between six and 24 months to deliver.</p>
<p>Following the DMB’s January decision, the proposal had not been developed further. </p>
<p>The Inquiry has seen no further references about taking the proposal forward.</p>
<p><b>1188. </b> On 22 March, Lt Gen Houghton wrote to Lord Drayson requesting approval to </p>
<p>adopt an “unusual contracting mechanism” quickly to deliver Tier 3 hardened structures </p>
<p>at BAS.</p>
<p>624</p>
<p> That involved using a “single, trusted Prime Contractor and using proven </p>
<p>nominated sub&#8209;contractors for discrete, complex elements of the work”; the contract </p>
<p>would not go through a tendering process.</p>
<p><b>1189. </b> The timescale for delivery was still 18 months but Lt Gen Houghton thought this </p>
<p>was “a pessimistic figure” that could be reduced to 12 months once a detailed design </p>
<p>had been agreed. There were no existing proven designs for structures that provided the </p>
<p>level of protection sought, so design work was “breaking new ground”. That also made </p>
<p>it unwise to shorten the design and trials period, but time would be saved by adopting </p>
<p>the single tender process. </p>
<p><b>1190. </b> Costs were estimated at US$28m for hardening dining facilities and US$145m for </p>
<p>hardening “accommodation etc” for 4,500 personnel.</p>
<p><b>1191. </b> A note from Lord Drayson’s Private Office on 26 April formally approved the </p>
<p>contracting mechanism proposed by Lt Gen Houghton, but suggested that Lord Drayson </p>
<p>had agreed it informally before that date.</p>

<p>626</p>
<p> That included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an additional £15m plus for ECM (see earlier in this Section);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£50m for a C&#8209;RAM system; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£87m plus for intelligence and surveillance capabilities for both Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan, including ISTAR enhancements.</p>
<p><b>1193. </b> That request was sent amidst the discussions between the Treasury and the </p>
<p>MOD on the sustainability of the UOR process, which is addressed earlier in this Section </p>
<p>in the context of protected mobility, and in detail in Section 13.1. </p>
<p><b>1194. </b> On 24 April, Lt Gen Houghton briefed the Chiefs of Staff that the security </p>
<p>situation in MND(SE) had been “dominated” by an IDF attack against Basra Palace.</p>
<p>627</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Work continued on IDF protection and Phalanx was scheduled to be in place at the COB </p>
<p>by 31 May.</p>
<p><b>1195. </b> In discussion, the Chiefs noted:</p>
<p>“The critical need for measures to mitigate the IDF threat, both against people and </p>
<p>equipment remained an issue of strategic importance. The risk to helicopters on the </p>
<p>ground in particular was of concern, and while rear basing (where possible) could </p>
<p>minimise the risk, the better option was to ensure that effective physical protection </p>
<p>measures were in place. <b>CJO was to conduct a rapid investigation into the </b></p>
<p><b>provision of additional physical protection for helicopters at the COB.</b>”</p>
<p><b>1196. </b> The Chiefs of Staff also noted that the C&#8209;RAM capability had been off&#8209;line during </p>
<p>the IDF attack, undergoing repairs after an earlier attack. The introduction of Phalanx </p>
<p>could not be advanced. It was agreed that Scan Eagle cover should be extended until </p>
<p>Hermes was operational in theatre.</p>
<p><b>1197. </b> On 11 May, Dr Sarah Beaver, Command Secretary at PJHQ, updated Lord </p>
<p>Drayson on the procurement process for hardened accommodation at BAS.</p>
<p>628</p>

<p>She asked Lord Drayson to approve the first tranche of building work and to write to </p>
<p>Mr Timms seeking the Treasury’s agreement in principle that funding for the project </p>
<p>could be met from the Reserve. </p>
<p><b>1198. </b> The proposals received from the contractor quoted “some £95m” for the </p>
<p>work, excluding VAT. The build would be done in three tranches: the first providing </p>

<p><b>1199. </b> The first tranche could be delivered between 31 May and 31 August 2008 and </p>
<p>would cost £40m. The date for overall completion of the project was estimated as </p>
<p>“by December 2009”. Achieving those timescales was dependent on “long lead items” </p>
<p>for the first tranche at a cost of £14m. That expenditure would be at risk on the core </p>
<p>Defence budget unless the Treasury approved a call on the Reserve.</p>
<p><b>1200. </b> Mr Browne wrote to Mr Timms on 21 May.</p>
<p>629</p>
<p> He stated that the MOD was </p>
<p>proceeding with the £14m purchase of long lead items but would not commit further </p>
<p>without Treasury agreement to fund from the Reserve. He added that the MOD would </p>
<p>“negotiate a contract with suitable break clauses to allow us to reduce the project should </p>
<p>circumstances allow and keep the overall requirement under review”. </p>
<p><b>1201. </b> Mr Timms replied on 30 May.</p>
<p>630</p>
<p> He agreed that the £14m could be taken from the </p>
<p>Reserve but added:</p>
<p>“In considering further funding, the business case for the project will need to </p>
<p>demonstrate the continued requirement for the build once current UORs that seek </p>
<p>to address the same indirect fire issue … are deployed and operational in the COB. </p>
<p>In addition, we will need to be convinced that the long construction time for the </p>
<p>project is coherent with the UK strategic timeline for maintaining troops in Iraq, and </p>
<p>the concept of operations for troops in the COB after withdrawal from Basra City. </p>
<p>“… We should treat this initial funding as a net additional cost of operations, but it is </p>
<p>explicitly <b>not</b> a UOR, and should not be classified as such, given that it is investment </p>
<p>in infrastructure and not equipment …” </p>

<p><b>1204. </b> Lt Gen Houghton was asked to provide the Chiefs of Staff with an analysis of the </p>

<p><b>1205. </b> On 12 June, Lord Drayson was advised that initial operating capability for Hermes </p>

<p>634</p>
<p><b>1208. </b> On 10 July, Lt Gen Houghton briefed the Chiefs of Staff that, between April and </p>
<p>July 2007, there had been a “marked increase” in attacks to the COB with over 200 IDF </p>
<p>attacks in a three&#8209;month period.</p>
<p>635</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1209. </b> In his post&#8209;operation tour report, Major General Jonathan Shaw, GOC MND(SE) </p>

<p>“By late 2007, we had a very sophisticated method of protecting ourselves against </p>
<p>rocket attack, which was the predominant form of attack.”</p>
<p>638</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1212. </b> When asked about the threat of IDF, Maj Gen Binns said it had “reduced </p>
<p>significantly” because of the improvement in surveillance:</p>
<p>“Our ability to engage those who were firing rockets at us from the air improved to </p>
<p>such an extent that we forced them back into the town and the further away they </p>
<p>are, the more inaccurate they are. So the whole threat of indirect fire reduced. </p>

<p>It was still an irritant, but the number of casualties sustained by indirect fire reduced </p>
<p>dramatically from August onwards.”</p>
<p><b>1213. </b> In September, the DOC undertook an “extensive review and analysis” of the </p>
<p>UK’s force protection capability in order to “expose risk, provide assurance and present </p>
<p>strategic recommendations” to the Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>639</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1214. </b> The review is addressed earlier in this Section with regards to protected mobility </p>
<p>but specific points were also made about countering the IDF threat.</p>
<p><b>1215. </b> The DOC wrote that units should have access to force protection equipment </p>
<p>prior to pre&#8209;deployment training if possible to ensure that all personnel were adequately </p>
<p>trained in force protection procedures and equipment (particularly UOR equipment) </p>
<p>before arriving in theatre. The “recent Treasury decision to permit UOR procured </p>
<p>equipment to include an allocation for training” was already having an effect but it was </p>
<p>noteworthy that “several Commands were not aware of this significant development”.</p>
<p><b>1216. </b> On accommodation, the DOC stated that the current Tier system was “based </p>
<p>on permanence (rather than the provision of FP)” and the nature of contemporary </p>
<p>operations suggested that that approach might be “sub&#8209;optimal” for force protection:</p>
<p>“Recent experience has indicated that the decision to move from tents to more </p>
<p>resilient steel/concrete structures tends to be delayed by the understandable desire </p>
<p>to limit the deployed footprint, but this should be balanced against the nature of the </p>
<p>threat and type of operation (as well as other criteria such as FPE [Force Protection </p>
<p>Engineering] effort, cost and the logistic burden).”</p>
<p><b>1217. </b> Considering the IDF threat, the DOC wrote that “the most effective way of </p>
<p>reducing the potential scale of a successful IDF attack is through a mix of good </p>
<p>ISTAR, physical compartmentalisation and infrastructure protection together with </p>

<p>“initial teething problems”, its performance was improving. The likelihood of IDF being </p>

<p>CONSIDERING WHETHER TO DEPLOY REAPER TO IRAQ</p>
<p><b>1220. </b> ACM Stirrup visited Iraq from 13 to 16 May 2007.</p>
<p>640</p>
<p> Considering the IDF threat, </p>
<p>the report of his visit stated:</p>
<p>“CDS believed an armed UAV would provide the ideal platform to deliver a precision, </p>
<p>time sensitive response whilst minimising the risks of collateral damage.”</p>
<p><b>1221. </b> Lt Gen Figgures was tasked to investigate how an armed UAV might be acquired.</p>
<p><b>1222. </b> On 25 May, Lt Gen Figgures advised ACM Stirrup that there were three options </p>
<p>for providing a weaponised UAV in Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extending the Reaper programme (a UK version of Predator B) to purchase </p>
<p>extra airframes for Iraq (the funding at this time was for three airframes all to be </p>
<p>delivered to Afghanistan);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asserting pressure on the US to apportion a greater proportion of Predator A </p>
<p>hours to MND(SE); or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>investigating the possibility of weaponising Hermes 450.</p>
<p>641</p>
<p><b>1223. </b> On 12 June, Air Cdre Gordon advised Lord Drayson that the option to purchase a </p>
<p>further nine Reaper as part of the 2007 Equipment Programme had been delayed until </p>
<p>the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review was known.</p>
<p>642</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1224. </b> The Inquiry asked ACM Stirrup if there were decisions he wished had been taken </p>
<p>differently during his time as DCDS(EC).</p>
<p>643</p>
<p> He replied that one of the difficulties had </p>
<p>been that pressures on the defence programme and equipment plan had meant that </p>
<p>money was taken out of areas that needed increased investment. </p>
<p><b>1225. </b> ACM Stirrup told the Inquiry that, up until 2002, funding in ISTAR had increased </p>
<p>by 15 percent but some of that was removed in subsequent years through savings </p>
<p>measures. He added:</p>
<p>“I also felt that we were far too slow to improve our capabilities in persistent </p>
<p>surveillance, particularly through unmanned vehicles, and when I became CDS, </p>
<p>one of the first things I did was to stop the arguing about whether we should </p>
<p>purchase Reaper from the United States and tell people to go and buy it, and it is </p>
<p>now in operation as a consequence.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>1226. </b> On 12 December, a USUR for an “armed long loiter, long range capability” was </p>
<p>raised by MND(SE).</p>
<p>644</p>
<p> It stated that existing measures to protect against IDF and IEDs </p>
<p>were reactive: </p>
<p>“MND(SE) therefore needs a pro&#8209;active SENSE capability that will also INTERCEPT </p>
<p>IED and IDF attacks before they can launch their attack. Rapid and decisive </p>
<p>disruption of IED and IDF teams will also be a potential deterrent.”</p>
<p><b>1227. </b> The USUR stated that between January and October 2007:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IED attacks had caused 21 deaths and 81 casualties.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IDF attacks had caused five deaths and 127 casualties. The rate of attacks had </p>
<p>abated since September but the sustained level of attacks by insurgents in the </p>
<p>first part of the year indicated “their capability and capacity to sustain high rates </p>
<p>of fire when the intent exists”.</p>
<p><b>1228. </b> The operational requirement was:</p>
<p>“… to observe insurgents and their weapon systems (IDF/IED) across the AO [Area </p>
<p>of Operations] over long durations and long range, which is integrated with a rapid, </p>
<p>precision capability to engage targets once identified.”</p>
<p><b>1229. </b> The solution proposed by MND(SE) was an armed Predator B UAV.</p>
<p><b>1230. </b> The Inquiry asked the MOD to confirm that the Predator B (Reaper) was never </p>
<p>deployed to Iraq. The MOD stated that it was “available to the UK as a Coalition asset” </p>
<p>but was never deployed to Iraq.</p>
<p>645</p>
<p>THE DRAWDOWN OF UK FORCES</p>
<p><b>1231. </b> From July 2007, the further hardening of accommodation was complicated by </p>
<p>uncertainty surrounding the UK’s position in Iraq. Mr Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, </p>
<p>announced plans for the military drawdown in Basra in October.</p>
<p><b>1232. </b> On 29 July 2007, Mr Browne wrote to Mr Andy Burnham, Chief Secretary </p>
<p>to the Treasury, requesting an additional £32m from the Reserve for hardened </p>
<p>accommodation.</p>
<p>646</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1233. </b> Mr Browne explained that the estimated total cost of the work at Basra Air Station </p>
<p>would be £186m and work would be complete by March 2011. Due to “uncertainties on </p>
<p>future force levels”, it was proposed to approve the structures in “up to six tranches”.</p>

<p><b>1234. </b> Mr James Quinault, Head of the Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence spending </p>
<p>team in the Treasury, advised Mr Burnham to “hold off” replying until September, </p>
<p>pending decisions about the scale and duration of the UK’s commitment in Basra.</p>
<p>647</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1235. </b> Mr Burnham replied on 11 September 2007.</p>
<p>648</p>
<p> He recognised that the case for </p>
<p>hardening accommodation was “compelling” if UK troops were to remain at Basra Air </p>
<p>Station for a prolonged period, but that “the scale of additional resources committed </p>
<p>to the project” should be agreed once there was greater clarity on the UK’s posture in </p>
<p>Basra, expected at the end of that month. He concluded:</p>
<p>“It is clearly desirable that you continue to take the decisions necessary to ensure </p>
<p>that suitable accommodation can be provided as soon as possible should UK troops </p>
<p>remain in theatre for the foreseeable future. I understand that you are currently </p>
<p>taking such decisions at risk of around £10m to your own budget. I think this is </p>
<p>prudent and you should be reassured that, in the event of a decision for an early </p>
<p>withdrawal, these sunk costs will be admissible against the Reserve.”</p>
<p><b>Moving JHF&#8209;I to Kuwait</b></p>
<p>On 5 October 2007, a PJHQ official sought Mr Browne’s agreement for the UK to establish </p>
<p>a logistic support facility in Kuwait.</p>
<p>649</p>
<p> It would include the relocation of JHF&#8209;I. The minute </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“The proximity of Camp Buehring to Basra (around 30 minutes flying time) allows </p>
<p>us to de&#8209;risk the force protection of our helicopters without affecting their ability to </p>
<p>undertake their operational tasking. A forward helicopter detachment will however </p>
<p>remain in the COB as the Incident Response Team (IRT).” </p>
<p>Mr Browne agreed on 9 October.</p>
<p>650</p>
<p><b>1236. </b> On 2 October, Major General James Dutton, DCJO(Ops), briefed the Chiefs of </p>

<p>651</p>

<p>210</p>
<p>the Reserve for Tranche 2 of the hardened accommodation programme.</p>
<p>652</p>
<p> Tranche 2 </p>
<p>comprised a hardened medical facility and three hardened accommodation blocks, </p>
<p>housing a total of 900 personnel.</p>
<p><b>1238. </b> Mr Gibson wrote that force level planning for spring 2008 suggested there would </p>
<p>be 2,830 UK military personnel, along with supporting civilians, contractors and other </p>
<p>“multi&#8209;national military elements”, bringing the total number of personnel at Basra Air </p>
<p>Station to 5,321. A further 745 UK military personnel would be based at the Kuwait </p>
<p>support facility. </p>
<p><b>1239. </b> To avoid “a situation where we failed to provide protection for personnel should </p>
<p>UK forces remain at the COB longer than we might originally have anticipated”, PJHQ’s </p>
<p>work assumed an “enduring military force of around 2,500”.</p>
<p><b>1240. </b> Mr Gibson recommended that Mr Browne should also seek £30m of the </p>
<p>£32m currently carried at risk for the first tranche and the subject of Mr Browne and </p>
<p>Mr Burnham’s correspondence in September. The £2m “delta” reflected Treasury </p>
<p>uncertainty that an element of the dining facility protection was required.</p>
<p><b>1241. </b> Officials in Mr Browne’s Private Office replied on 12 December, stating </p>
<p>that Mr Browne agreed with Mr Gibson’s proposal and had written to Mr Burnham </p>
<p>accordingly.</p>
<p>653</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1242. </b> The reply also highlighted that Sir Bill Jeffrey had written to Mr Browne on </p>
<p>11 December confirming his view that to proceed with Tranche 2 was “justifiable” but the </p>
<p>position should be considered in the New Year, with the MOD ready to “scale the plans </p>
<p>down” if it seemed “right to do so”. </p>
<p><b>1243. </b> On 18 December, Mr Burnham agreed to fund both elements of the request but </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“We will, however, want to think together about the balance of investment decisions </p>
<p>to be taken on this project before I can commit to further funding … We will need </p>
<p>to be convinced that the long construction time … is coherent with the UK strategic </p>
<p>timeline for troop levels in Iraq, and the total numbers of people … that will be based </p>
<p>at the COB and require protection.”</p>

<p><b>1244. </b> Mr Bob Ainsworth, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, visited Iraq from </p>
<p>17 to 21 December 2007.</p>
<p>655</p>
<p> The visit report stated:</p>
<p>“The Minister saw for himself the effect of Operation Stonehenge – the hardening of </p>
<p>personal bed spaces. This, like C&#8209;RAM, appeared initially to have been greeted with </p>
<p>mixed feelings but was now generally considered to be a positive development, both </p>
<p>in terms of protection and morale.” </p>
<p><b>1245. </b> On 15 January 2008, Lt Gen Houghton told the Chiefs of Staff that Project </p>
<p>Stonehenge had “progressed well” and would be complete by February.</p>
<p>656</p>
<p> The third </p>
<p>tranche of the Tier 3 hardening project was progressing and 2,100 hardened bunks </p>
<p>would be complete by 2009, although the final decision point on this for Ministers was </p>
<p>20 March 2008.</p>
<p><b>1246. </b> On 20 March, Mr Gibson advised Mr Browne to place Tranche 3 of the </p>
<p>hardened accommodation programme on hold because of uncertainty about the UK’s </p>
<p>future presence in Iraq.</p>
<p>657</p>
<p> That tranche would have brought 1,500 further hardened </p>
<p>bed spaces, bringing the total to 2,400. He noted that the IDF threat had recently </p>
<p>increased and provided an analysis of the options, finally stating:</p>
<p>“This is a fine call, involving judgements about force levels over a year away. </p>
<p>It represents a significant change in emphasis in our approach to this project: in </p>
<p>essence, rather than continuing with Tier 3 until it is proven no longer to be required, </p>
<p>we would be deciding only to proceed with Tranche 3 once it has been demonstrated </p>
<p>that it was required, and in doing so for the first time accepting that we will not </p>
<p>provide Tier 3 accommodation for all at the COB as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>The ongoing work on future options for the UK’s long&#8209;term presence in southern </p>
<p>Iraq was unlikely to conclude before the summer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were options “under consideration” which would render Tranche 3 </p>
<p>“unnecessary”.</p>
<p><b>1248. </b> Mr Browne agreed that the Tranche 3 programme should be placed on hold until </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>1249. </b> On 30 May, Mr Gibson advised Mr Browne that the MOD should “cease to plan </p>
<p>on the basis that Tier 3 Tranche 3 will be required and take the steps necessary to </p>
<p>reconfigure Tranches 1 and 2” to get best value for money from the project.</p>
<p>659</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1250. </b> That was because the focus on training and mentoring of Iraqi Security Forces </p>
<p>meant there was “greater confidence” that the UK would have completed the bulk of its </p>
<p>mission in Iraq by early 2009. Against that background, it seemed unlikely to Mr Gibson </p>
<p>that the UK would need or wish to retain a large base at Basra Air Station. </p>
<p><b>1251. </b> While Ministerial decisions on the timing and pace of any drawdown in 2009 </p>
<p>were yet to be agreed, approval for Tranche 3 would be needed “now” if it were to be </p>
<p>delivered by “October&#8209;December 2009” (at the earliest). If a bid for funding was not </p>
<p>made before the summer, the project would not be delivered until 2010.</p>
<p><b>1252. </b> With “very limited time”, it was possible to adjust Tranches 1 and 2 into “a </p>
<p>more coherent package, perhaps consisting of two feeding halls, the hospital plus five </p>
<p>accommodation blocks, sufficient for a force of around 1,500”. Mr Gibson advised that </p>
<p>that was “the most pragmatic, best value for money approach without taking excessive </p>
<p>additional risk over and above the other options currently available to us”. </p>
<p><b>1253. </b> On 26 July, Brigadier Julian Free, Commander of 4 Mechanised Brigade, </p>
<p>assessed that the completion of enhanced individual overhead protection had “markedly </p>
<p>increased the force protection afforded to troops on the COB” but warned that the risk </p>
<p>of a mass casualty event still remained.</p>
<p>660</p>
<p> He implied that was because not all of the </p>
<p>communal buildings had been hardened. </p>
<p><b>1254. </b> On 17 October, a PJHQ official advised Mr Browne that the final structure of first </p>
<p>tranche would be complete and operational by 20 October.</p>
<p>661</p>
<p> The other structures had </p>
<p>come into use on 14 July, 14 August and 24 September.</p>
<p><b>1255. </b> The second tranche was “to start coming on line in March&#8209;April 2009” but, given </p>
<p>the plans for transition, it was unlikely that the UK would “derive significant benefit from </p>
<p>these facilities”.</p>
<p><b>1256. </b> The US had expressed an interest in taking over structures from the first two </p>
<p>tranches as part of their plans to move to Basra Air Station in 2009. It was estimated </p>
<p>that £4.9m could be saved from stopping the Tranche 2 programme “now” but PJHQ </p>
<p>judged, subject to Ministerial and Treasury approval, “it would make sense to complete </p>
<p>the structures as part of a wider arrangement with the US regarding the transfer of </p>
<p>responsibility in MND(SE)”. That would still result in a £3.5m saving. </p>

<p><b>1257. </b> While hardened accommodation would no longer be provided to 900 </p>
<p>personnel from March to April 2009 as planned, forces would be living in the existing </p>
<p>accommodation until drawdown. Personal overhead protection was “now fitted to every </p>
<p>military, MOD civilian and OGD civilian’s sleeping bay” and the level of IDF remained </p>
<p>“much reduced from previous levels”. </p>
<p><b>1258. </b> On 18 November, Ms Cheryl Plumridge, Command Secretary at PJHQ, sent an </p>
<p>update on the hardened accommodation programme to Mr John Hutton, the Defence </p>
<p>Secretary.</p>
<p>662</p>
<p> The advice sought to re&#8209;address the issues raised in the 17 October </p>
<p>minute, which had been withdrawn following questions from Mr Hutton’s Private Office. </p>
<p><b>1259. </b> Ms Plumridge explained that the planned adjustments to Tranche 2, to create a </p>
<p>medical facility and accommodation blocks, had been put on hold following discussions </p>
<p>with the US who, for its own purposes, preferred the structures to be left empty.</p>
<p><b>1260. </b> The UK would need an agreement with the Iraqi Government to reflect the </p>
<p>transfer of any structures to the US instead of to Iraq, assuming standard terms were </p>
<p>agreed in the Status of Forces Agreement (see Section 9.7). </p>
<p><b>1261. </b> Ms Plumridge wrote: “Balance of risk has been at the heart of the Tier 3 project </p>
<p>as it has developed and Ministers have previously accepted increased risk in this area.” </p>
<p>She highlighted the cancellation of Tranche 3 and stated the revised plan would now </p>
<p>only provide Tier 3 protection for the feeding halls.</p>
<p><b>1262. </b> It was “extremely hard to predict the impact of not having Tier 3 accommodation” </p>
<p>and instead relying on Stonehenge. Ms Plumridge laid out the different factors that could </p>
<p>lead to a mass casualty event occurring and stated:</p>
<p>“To put this into context, as at today’s date, 45 days have passed since the last </p>
<p>indirect fire attack on the COB – so we are currently a long way from the worst&#8209;case </p>
<p>position.”</p>
<p><b>1263. </b> Ms Plumridge proposed that PJHQ officials would seek Treasury approval for </p>
<p>the structures to be treated as a gift to the US, in line with the arguments set out in the </p>
<p>17 October minute. </p>
<p><b>1264. </b> Mr Hutton approved Ms Plumridge’s proposal on 25 November.</p>

<p><b>1268. </b> The update noted that there were five Merlin and six Lynx in Basra and there </p>
<p>were seven helicopters in Baghdad. The Sea King fleet had been withdrawn earlier </p>
<p>than planned because of the reduction in troop levels and the helicopters were being </p>
<p>switched to Afghanistan, four having already been deployed. </p>
<p><b>1269. </b> The requirement for the six Danish Merlins procured to enable the release of the </p>
<p>Sea King fleet from Iraq had “fallen away along with our reduction in force levels there” </p>
<p>so the possibility of deploying them to Afghanistan was under consideration.</p>
<p><b>1270. </b> Mr Browne explained:</p>
<p>“It may seem counter&#8209;intuitive that, despite the fact we have so many more </p>
<p>helicopters in our inventory, we are able to deploy a relatively small number on </p>
<p>operations. We are limited by the need to keep our burden on our airframes, crews </p>
<p>and ground support staff at a sustainable level over time. As a rule of thumb, it takes </p>
<p>three or four additional helicopters to enable the deployment of a single helicopter </p>
<p>on operations with the remaining aircraft used for training and to enable us to rotate </p>
<p>our deployed helicopters in and out of maintenance and to carry out essential </p>
<p>modification programmes.”</p>
<p><b>1271. </b> Mr Browne concluded:</p>
<p>“To borrow a line from David Cameron, there is no ‘magic pot’ of money into which </p>
<p>we can dip in order to buy all the helicopters we might like to. We do not have </p>
<p>access to the Treasury Reserve for the procurement of such enduring capabilities, </p>
<p>and helicopters must compete with other pressing requirements within our </p>
<p>hard&#8209;pressed equipment programme. Equally neither are there any helicopters </p>
<p>currently readily available on the market which would be an obvious aspiration for </p>
<p>us; most order books are full, and the procurement of a new helicopter type would </p>
<p>be both costly and time&#8209;consuming.</p>
<p>“That said, I can give you an assurance that, while we continue to make the most </p>
<p>of what we have got … This is not an area where we can afford complacency. </p>

<p>We shall continue to seek out opportunities to improve and enhance our deployed </p>
<p>helicopter fleets … but I believe that we are on the right path towards an enduring </p>
<p>and sustainable capability which will allow us to fulfil our key tasks, delivering upon </p>
<p>our important commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>1272. </b> A report of Mr Ainsworth’s visit to Iraq in December 2007 stated:</p>
<p>“Concerns were raised with regard to ISTAR provision, which had decreased over </p>
<p>recent months, but which would become increasingly important in the overwatch </p>
<p>posture; there had been successes – such as Hermes 450 – but the withdrawal </p>
<p>of capabilities such as the Danish … helicopter and Scan Eagle were significant </p>
<p>losses.”</p>
<p>665</p>
<p><b>1273. </b> Mr Ainsworth was briefed by key personnel involved in manning and operating the </p>
<p>C&#8209;RAM system:</p>
<p>“He was reassured to hear that its success rate in interdicting IDF rounds continued </p>
<p>to improve although he noted that there was still some way to go. He was </p>
<p>particularly struck by the extent to which the general perception of C&#8209;RAM’s </p>
<p>capability had turned around since his last visit, with personnel at all levels praising </p>
<p>its hugely positive impact on morale.”</p>
<p><b>1274. </b> On 9 January 2008, a junior officer in MND(SE) produced a review of ISTAR </p>
<p>capability within MND(SE) for PJHQ.</p>
<p>666</p>
<p> He explained that the move to Provincial Iraqi </p>
<p>Control (PIC) in the UK’s AOR had:</p>
<p>“… necessitated a wholesale review of ISTAR capability to support the MND(SE) </p>
<p>mission. This has occurred at a time when there is a noticeable reduction in </p>
<p>the ISTAR assets and capabilities provided by organic and MNC&#8209;I/Theatre </p>
<p>platforms. This is now affecting MND(SE)’s ability to prosecute operations against </p>
<p>irreconcilable Shia extremists and will constrain MND(SE) in delivering its missions </p>
<p>and tasks …”</p>
<p><b>1275. </b> The officer made a number of recommendations including bringing forward the </p>
<p>Astor and Raptor programmes, introducing an aircraft such as Defender to enable </p>
<p>low&#8209;level support to ground forces and the introduction of a weaponised UAV capability.</p>
<p><b>1276. </b> The officer stated that MND(SE) could find no record of “a formal ISTAR </p>
<p>Estimate” having been conducted and “rather an iterative approach” had been adopted, </p>
<p>“resulting in a fragmented approach to ISTAR” that had led to capability gaps.</p>
<p><b>1277. </b> Considering the FMV capability, the officer explained that there were “a number of </p>
<p>Corps assets” but MND(SE) was having “less success in securing these” and two assets </p>

<p>with a degree of certainty”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hermes 450 which suffered from technical and spares issues. It was </p>
<p>recommended that its maintenance contract was re&#8209;negotiated to expedite </p>

<p><b>1282. </b> An internal Army lessons learned report was published on 31 August 2010, known </p>
<p>as the “Barry Report”.</p>
<p>669</p>
<p> It stated that one of the lessons for future transitions was to </p>
<p>increase, not decrease, the ISTAR requirement:</p>
<p>“As transition progresses and UK boots and eyes on the ground decrease, so there </p>
<p>is an increased requirement for ISTAR in order to maintain the same overall level </p>
<p>of situational awareness. The Iraq experience demonstrated that once we withdrew </p>
<p>to the COB we lost a very large part of our situational awareness. Supporting </p>
<p>indigenous forces with our ISTAR also enhances effectiveness and commanders’ </p>
<p>prestige and thereby maintains our ability to influence.”</p>
<p><b>1283. </b> On IDF, the Barry Report stated:</p>
<p>“In 2004 MND(SE) had predicted that the IDF threat would increase … the threat </p>
<p>was acknowledged but did not seem to result in structural force protection of our </p>
<p>bases for some time. Although some were in very robust buildings, such as Basra </p>
<p>Palace, the majority of troops on the COB remained in tented accommodation until </p>
<p>very late in the campaign …” </p>
<p><b>1284. </b> The DOC’s final Op TELIC lessons report was endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 17 March 2010.</p>
<p>670</p>
<p> It stated that there had been a lack of an enduring intelligence </p>
<p>picture for “at least the first four years” of the campaign and that perhaps that stemmed </p>
<p>from “the very widely held view that, up to and throughout 2006 and into 2007, there </p>
<p>were insufficient ISTAR assets available to MND(SE), and hence by necessity they were </p>
<p>focused on maintaining as much of the day&#8209;to&#8209;day tactical picture as possible”.</p>
<p><b>1285. </b> The DOC wrote that it had also been suggested “that rather than there not </p>
<p>being enough, the Coalition as a <i>whole </i>had sufficient ISTAR assets; but that due to </p>
<p>a lack of in&#8209;depth understanding of the capability”, the effort was “mistakenly focused </p>
<p>on requesting ISTAR platforms rather than their product”. It continued:</p>
<p>“The situation was exacerbated by the lack of effective engagement by MND(SE) </p>
<p>with MNC&#8209;I via the coalition chain of command. The result was increased requests </p>
<p>from theatre directly to the UK for additional national ISTAR assets, which were </p>
<p>eventually provided. Had the correct engagement of the in&#8209;theatre chain of </p>
<p>command been followed this might have delivered the required increase in ISTAR </p>
<p>capability far sooner.” </p>
<p><b>1286. </b> The DOC report offered the following lessons:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“When tasking limited ISTAR assets sources, consideration of the creation and </p>
<p>maintenance of the strategic through to the tactical picture must be undertaken.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“When operating as part of a coalition, understanding the procedures to gain </p>
<p>access to coalition ISTAR assets are vital; defaulting to the national route, whilst </p>
<p>potentially easier, will probably not deliver as quickly.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>1287. </b> In his review of the land operation in Iraq, Brig Barry wrote that “there was no </p>
<p>effective single land sponsor for ISTAR”.</p>
<p>671</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“There is overwhelming evidence of a comprehensive failure to generate an </p>
<p>adequate tactical intelligence capability to meet the requirements of tactical </p>
<p>commanders. What capability was fielded was almost always too little too late. </p>
<p>This appears to have resulted from significant weaknesses in almost every area </p>
<p>of intelligence direction, collection, analysis, dissemination …”</p>
<p><b>1288. </b> Comparing the ISTAR assets across the coalition, Brig Barry wrote that senior </p>
<p>US officers were “astonished to find the UK so lacking” in that capability. The US </p>
<p>were able to field platforms capable of both persistent ISTAR and armed action which </p>
<p>improved the ability to engage fleeting targets and act as deterrent “top cover” for ground </p>
<p>troops. The UK never had sufficient assets to do the same.</p>
<p><b>1289. </b> On the lack of UAVs, Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that he had been told that </p>
<p>“no more staff effort could possibly be put into deploying UAVs to South&#8209;East Iraq”.</p>
<p>672</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He thought that that was not because of the intention to draw down forces, but because </p>
<p>the MOD “was incapable of generating the drive and energy to deliver them”.</p>
<p><b>1290. </b> Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that there was always a worry that UK forces </p>
<p>would find it difficult to respond if security in MND(SE) deteriorated.</p>
<p>673</p>
<p> He said that the </p>
<p>problem was not so much the number of UK troops available but “it was more to do with </p>
<p>situational awareness and intelligence”. </p>
<p><b>1291. </b> Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that ISTAR was “the major issue” and that </p>
<p>“we never got as much as we wanted”. While the UOR system was a responsive one, </p>
<p>and new equipment arrived “at a remarkable rate”, Maj Gen Shaw said that UAVs were </p>
<p>“the big equipment shortage and problem”.</p>
<p><b>1292. </b> Sir Peter Spencer, Chief of Defence Procurement from May 2003 to April 2007, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that ISTAR was “a classic example” of where incremental procurement </p>
<p>was necessary.</p>
<p>674</p>
<p> He stated that anybody who “tried to envisage a big bang project </p>
<p>which will deliver everything you need will get it wrong, because the time it takes to </p>
<p>develop will be such that during that period all of your assumptions would have been </p>
<p>tested and some will have changed”.</p>
<p><b>1293. </b> Sir Peter said that he thought the MOD went about trying to understand the </p>
<p>requirement “quite well”, by putting “some really good people in place who concentrated </p>
<p>on it quite hard”. The testing point came where the MOD “was invited to cancel a major </p>
<p>project platform to pay for it”.</p>

<p><b>1294. </b> The difficulty with Watchkeeper was that “it became very political”.</p>
<p>675</p>
<p> Sir Peter </p>
<p>referred to Lord Bach’s evidence before the House of Commons Defence Committee, </p>
<p>in which Sir Peter said that Lord Bach gave an In Service Date “under political pressure” </p>
<p>and before the requirement was properly understood.</p>
<p><b>1295. </b> Sir Peter said that “you have to be thick&#8209;skinned enough to stand up to that </p>
<p>pressure politely, but in a way which informs Ministers that … a short term gain here </p>
<p>is going to lead to a lot of grief later”.</p>
<p><b>1296. </b> At the time that the MOD was debating whether to bring in the Hermes 450 UAV </p>
<p>as a “gap filler”, Sir Peter said: “there were some quite hard decisions which needed </p>
<p>to be made in London by the military customer to decide what they want to spend the </p>
<p>money on, because they could not have both simultaneously”.</p>
<p>676</p>
<p><b>1297. </b> Sir Peter concluded:</p>
<p>“The compelling lesson from all of this is if you want something quickly to work, </p>
<p>you go for something which is available apart from anything you might need to do </p>
<p>to integrate it to work inside your own organisation, because there will be some </p>
<p>aspects of the way we operate UK military forces which will be different, say, from </p>
<p>the Americans.”</p>
<p>677</p>
<p><b>1298. </b> The Inquiry asked Lt Gen Figgures whether, if the Reaper UAV that was sent to </p>
<p>Afghanistan had instead been sent to Iraq, it would have made a difference to the UK’s </p>
<p>ability to defend itself against the indirect fire threat at Basra Air Station.</p>
<p>678</p>
<p> He replied </p>
<p>that it “could potentially have made a difference. Indeed the Hermes in 2007 and Desert </p>
<p>Hawk I think had some success.”</p>
<p><b>1299. </b> Lt Gen Fulton acknowledged to the Inquiry that the UK should have procured its </p>
<p>own UAV sooner than the Hermes 450 in 2007.</p>
<p>679</p>
<p><b>1300. </b> The Watchkeeper UAV was never deployed to Iraq. The MOD told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>it came into sevice in August 2014 and was deployed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>680</p>
<p><b>1301. </b> Asked when Watchkeeper had been scheduled to come into service, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fulton replied that he thought a date of 2009 to 2010 was “what people had </p>
<p>in mind”, but referred to Lord Bach’s evidence to the House of Commons Defence </p>
<p>Committee in June 2003 that it would be 2005 to 2006.</p>
<p>681</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“I think what that showed was not so much that they got it wrong, but a reflection </p>
<p>of the keenness to get it in, and the wish to put pressure on not only us to work </p>

<p><b>1302. </b> Speaking about the areas of capability in which it was not possible to invest to </p>
<p>the extent he would have liked, Lt Gen Figgures said of ISTAR:</p>
<p>“Did we anticipate the requirement we would need [to] provide coverage of areas as </p>
<p>big as southern Iraq or as big as Afghanistan? No we didn’t and therefore we had to </p>
<p>develop that.”</p>
<p>682</p>
<p><b>1303. </b> The Inquiry asked Gen Dannatt about his visit report from October 2006 where </p>
<p>he had raised the need for greater ISTAR capability.</p>
<p>683</p>
<p> He referred to the Watchkeeper </p>
<p>programme and said that was another example of where savings were made to the </p>
<p>programme only to be added back later as a UOR or emergency programme:</p>
<p>“Once a real operational requirement for UAVs was derived for Iraq and Afghanistan, </p>
<p>surprise, surprise, energy was then put back into the Watchkeeper programme. </p>
<p>Money was added back into the Watchkeeper programme. Hermes 450 … was </p>
<p>brought forward.”</p>
<p><b>1304. </b> Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry that it was difficult to have a balanced programme </p>
<p>of capability for future when the present was “staring you very bloodily in the face”.</p>
<p>684</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“The trick is not to be so wrong that you can’t adjust when the future reveals </p>
<p>itself. That’s what I think we should be working towards at the present moment. </p>
<p>Absolutely funding properly what is staring us in the face, which today is Afghanistan </p>

<p><b>1306. </b> The DOC considered the impact of the UK’s decision in 2005 to return to </p>

<p>221</p>
<p>“The challenges of prioritising insufficient resource, in terms of personnel, </p>
<p>equipment, funding, planning and decision making effort, between Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan, have had a direct and negative effect on the UK’s ability to carry out </p>
<p>all its tasks and responsibilities in both campaigns. These pressures of prioritising </p>
<p>resources between the assumed, but ultimately not achieved, rapid drawdown in </p>
<p>requirements of Op TELIC, and the increases required over and above the initial </p>
<p>estimate of troop numbers for Op HERRICK, were significant …”</p>
<p><b>1308. </b> The DOC stated that the growing casualty rates in Basra in 2006 and 2007 </p>
<p>increased public pressure on politicians to devote more resources to Iraq but by that </p>
<p>point “there was very limited scope to reverse, or even stop troop drawdown in Iraq: </p>
<p>“There had been a considerable hollowing out of capability in Basra over this period, </p>
<p>as a consequence of the need to meet the increasing demands of Afghanistan.” </p>
<p><b>1309. </b> Speaking about balancing the two commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, </p>
<p>General Sir Nicholas Houghton told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I felt in Iraq, we could deliver the strategy, with risk, with the means that were </p>
<p>available, but it became relatively quickly evident that within Afghanistan we were </p>
<p>not militarily in a position of strategic coherence. We did not have the means to </p>
<p>deliver on objectives, and, therefore the requirement … to make us strategically </p>
<p>rebalanced in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>686</p>
<p><b>1310. </b> Gen Houghton said that it was not “troop numbers per se” that was the problem, </p>
<p>but rather the “strategic and operational enablement of them through what are rare </p>
<p>breed capabilities” such as strategic lift, ISTAR, aviation and attack helicopters.</p>
<p><b>1311. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that he was “very concerned” about the </p>
<p>discussions in 2004 to deploy an additional force to Afghanistan because the UK was </p>
<p>still “heavily engaged in Iraq” and was still recuperating from its large scale operation </p>
<p>during the invasion.</p>
<p>687</p>
<p> The view of the Chiefs of Staff was that “they could do it and it </p>
<p>was manageable” and so Sir Kevin did not press his “objections fully”. </p>
<p><b>1312. </b> The “planning assumption” was that the UK should put itself forward because </p>
<p>“if the UK didn’t come forward, nobody else was going to”. If the UK came forward, it </p>

<p>forces, helicopters, the things that we were relatively lacking in”. Sir Kevin recognised </p>
<p>that it was not possible to predict at that time, mid&#8209;2005, whether the UK would secure </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>1314. </b> Gen Jackson replied that it was “not unreasonable” at that time to have forecast </p>
<p>the UK’s drawdown “to probably a few hundred” but the difficulty was that the timetable </p>
<p>for Iraq did not go as planned. He said it was not possible, when the timetable did go </p>
<p>awry, to “suddenly put up our hand and say, ‘We can’t do this in Afghanistan’”, because </p>
<p>it would have “severely disrupted” the whole NATO effort.</p>
<p><b>1315. </b> Gen Jackson said the fact that the Defence Planning Assumptions “were not </p>
<p>upheld by events” and were “almost overturned by events” demonstrated how difficult it </p>
<p>was to predict what future capabilities were necessary.</p>
<p>689</p>
<p><b>1316. </b> The Inquiry heard evidence about how running two medium scale operations </p>
<p>concurrently had an impact on the provision of support helicopters.</p>
<p><b>1317. </b> Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Nobody wanted to deploy any more troops … or any more helicopters. In fact, </p>
<p>I can recall a conversation with DCDS(C) [Lt Gen Rob Fry], perhaps a slightly </p>
<p>light&#8209;hearted one which was ‘Don’t, whatever you do, ask for any more helicopters’. </p>
<p>Of course, we did end up asking for lots more helicopters and we got some more </p>
<p>helicopters …”</p>
<p>690</p>
<p><b>1318. </b> Lt Gen Dutton added:</p>
<p>“Given the circumstances at the time and the helicopters that we had in the </p>
<p>inventory, I certainly felt that they [PJHQ] … were doing their best to provide, if not </p>
<p>more helicopters and crews, more hours because … that’s just as valuable if you </p>
<p>can fly the aircraft for longer and have the spares to allow you to do the servicing </p>
<p>to allow that.”</p>
<p>691</p>
<p><b>1319. </b> The Inquiry asked Lord Drayson what advice he had received on the ability of </p>
<p>the UK’s support helicopter force to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Lord Drayson wrote:</p>
<p>“I was advised that, although the UK’s helicopter force was under pressure </p>
<p>due to the decision taken in 2004 under Medium Term Workstrand to remove </p>
<p>funding, increased provision of flying hours and the deployment of additional </p>
<p>aircraft, the battlefield helicopter requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan were </p>
<p>being met (e.g.VCDS minute to SofS 7 Sept [2006] refers.). This however was </p>
<p>not the impression I gained following my visits to theatre. Again I found myself </p>
<p>having to get senior officers together to try to reach agreement on whether there </p>
<p>was a requirement, and if so, what it was. Even when we were in the process of </p>
<p>strengthening our helicopter capability in 2006/7 the view of the military was there </p>

<p>223</p>
<p>was no requirement in Afghanistan for more helicopters at the time, just a utility to </p>
<p>having more helicopters so we could meet future requirements. The military view </p>
<p>was also that there was no requirement for a new small helicopter.”</p>
<p>692</p>
<p><b>1320. </b> Asked if he was concerned whether the MOD had an insufficient number of </p>
<p>support helicopters capable of being deployed in the threat environment of Iraq, </p>
<p>Lord Drayson wrote:</p>
<p>“Yes … However it was difficult to get the military to agree on the requirement. </p>
<p>Helicopters specifically were not seen as the responsibility of any particular service </p>
<p>and therefore suffered from the lack of a ‘service champion’. It was not believed that </p>
<p>helicopters could be procured quickly …”</p>
<p><b>1321. </b> ACM Torpy disagreed with Lord Drayson’s view on helicopter ownership and </p>
<p>prioritisation. He told the Inquiry that the Joint Helicopter Command did have advocates </p>
<p>and champions:</p>
<p>“Actually it was owned by a single service. It was operational command CINC </p>
<p>Land Forces … So there was an advocate for Joint Helicopter Command, and if </p>
<p>I look at the interest that the three Chiefs took in Joint Helicopter Command it was </p>
<p>pretty key.”</p>
<p>693</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1322. </b> The Inquiry asked ACM Stirrup for his view of the helicopter situation during his </p>
<p>time as Chief of the Air Staff, from 2003 to 2006. He replied that it “was not a significant </p>
<p>issue” in Chiefs of Staff discussions during that time.</p>
<p>694</p>
<p> There was a requirement to </p>
<p>make modifications as lessons were learned, but “there was no sense that … we </p>
<p>needed – urgently needed twice as many helicopters than we had, although it was quite </p>
<p>clear that we could always have used more”.</p>
<p><b>1323. </b> ACM Stirrup told the Inquiry that, between 2006 and 2009, when he was Chief of </p>
<p>the Defence Staff, the constraint on the helicopter fleet was twofold:</p>
<p>“First was we had eight Chinooks sitting in a shed unable to fly. That is a significant </p>
<p>percentage of the total Chinook force …</p>
<p>“Secondly, we were operating in two theatres, which was well beyond our planning </p>
<p>assumptions and although it was a strain to generate sufficient infantry battalions for </p>
<p>the rotation between the two theatres, the really critical elements were the enablers. </p>
<p>They were the strategic and tactical mobility. They were the helicopters, they were </p>
<p>the ISTAR, they were all of those specialist areas that are so important for any </p>
<p>operation, wherever it is and whatever it is.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>1324. </b> The Inquiry asked Gen O’Donoghue whether increasing the flying hours </p>
<p>of helicopters sooner would have made sure that more were available in Iraq. </p>
<p>Gen O’Donoghue replied that it took time to do because more spares would have to </p>
<p>be acquired to fly the helicopters and maintenance schedules had to be adjusted.</p>
<p>696</p>
<p><b>1325. </b> Gen O’Donoghue said that there were a number of factors to consider when </p>
<p>looking at whether to procure a new type of helicopter, including the procurement cost, </p>
<p>the cost of certifying airworthiness, what changes were necessary to meet the theatre </p>
<p>entry standard and what was best to bring into service alongside existing models.</p>
<p><b>The £1.4bn reduction in helicopter spending</b></p>
<p>The majority of witnesses to the Inquiry said that the decision to reduce helicopter funding </p>
<p>by £1.4bn in 2004 had not had an effect on what was available for Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that he did not believe that earlier funding decisions about </p>
<p>the Equipment Programme were “relevant” to helicopter availability in Iraq.</p>
<p>697</p>
<p> That was </p>
<p>because of the lead time for any new helicopters to come into service.</p>
<p>Speaking about the Spending Review settlement in 2004, Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that the MOD preserved resources for Iraq and made cuts in the areas considered least </p>
<p>likely to be called upon.</p>
<p>698</p>
<p> He said that it was “very difficult” to say that it had had a </p>
<p>long&#8209;term impact on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan because the savings were made </p>
<p>in forward programmes, such as with helicopters.</p>
<p>The Inquiry asked Sir Peter Spencer if the £1.4bn reduction in 2004 had affected the </p>
<p>number of helicopters available in Iraq.</p>
<p>699</p>
<p> Sir Peter replied that he was unable to comment </p>
<p>on that specifically because he was not involved in the support of those helicopters but did </p>
<p>state that it was an example of how the MOD had to decide what its priorities were:</p>
<p>“[It] goes back to the fundamental issue at the heart of all of this, which is being more </p>
<p>realistic about what the money would actually buy you and to just accept that you </p>
<p>can’t have every toy in the shop.”</p>
<p>Lt Gen Fulton indicated that the spending reduction did not have an impact on Iraq as </p>
<p>it affected amphibious and light helicopter procurement rather than support helicopters </p>
<p>which is what commanders relied upon for troop transport:</p>
<p>“So for very good reasons, all the reasons you identify, whilst the £1.4bn cut to the </p>
<p>helicopter budget was profoundly unwelcome, it had no effect at all on anything to </p>
<p>do with Iraq.”</p>
<p>700</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gen Jackson said of the 2004 funding cut that he thought “some of the difficulties with </p>
<p>helicopters stem from that decision” as well as the procurement difficulties with the eight </p>
<p>Chinook Mk3s.</p>

<p>14.1  |  Military equipment (post-conflict)</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>In March 2011, the MOD told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Had SABR [Support Amphibious Battlefield Helicopter programme] continued, the </p>
<p>earliest delivery of new Chinooks would have been after the end of UK operations </p>
<p>in Iraq, so the Department does not assess that the removal of £1.4 billion from the </p>
<p>helicopter programme affected the availability of support helicopters for operations </p>
<p>in Iraq.”</p>
<p>702</p>
<p><b>1326. </b> The Inquiry was told that the Treasury was not an obstruction in the UOR process </p>
<p>but there were difficulties with the flexibility of the MOD’s budget.</p>
<p><b>1327. </b> Mr Ingram told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… everything had to be finely justified and there was constant tussles with the </p>
<p>Treasury in all of that as to whether it was a UOR or whether it should come from </p>
<p>core expenditure …”</p>
<p>703</p>
<p><b>1328. </b> Lt Gen Fulton told the Inquiry this process was one whereby “we had to try to find </p>
<p>the money ourselves and if we couldn’t find the money then we went to the Treasury for </p>
<p>UORs once Iraq had started”.</p>
<p>704</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1329. </b> Lt Gen Figgures described a process of rigorous scrutiny of requirements which </p>
<p>involved “some tough negotiation”.</p>
<p>705</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We were given considerable sums of money over the period of time that I filled my </p>
<p>appointment to make that case. Whether it was helicopters or protective mobility, </p>
<p>defensive aid suites, all of those where we made the case were funded, but it was – </p>
<p>they were very rigorous in their scrutiny of the case we put forward, and you could </p>
<p>as a taxpayer say, well, yes, they should be. As a soldier it was hard work producing </p>
<p>the evidence to get past that scrutiny.”</p>
<p>706</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1330. </b> Lt Gen Figgures added:</p>
<p>“When it came to the urgent operational requirements, if we could identify </p>
<p>requirement, justify it, have a reasonable idea of what it might cost, deliver it in </p>
<p>an acceptable time&#8209;frame, then the Treasury would give us the money for it …” </p>
<p><b>1331. </b> Asked whether he had sufficient resources to fund the equipment he thought </p>
<p>was relevant to operations in Iraq, Lt Gen Fulton told the Inquiry that the starting point </p>
<p>was that <i>The Strategic Defence Review </i>was not properly funded to deliver what it was </p>
<p>supposed to.</p>
<p>707</p>
<p> That meant that the MOD was left with “an equipment capability that </p>
<p>existed within but did not fill the defence planning requirement”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>1332. </b> Lord Drayson told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I actively stressed the importance of addressing the deficiencies of equipment </p>
<p>on operations following my visits to theatre and feedback from front line reports. </p>
<p>However the opportunities to redirect resources from core Equipment Programme </p>
<p>were limited by the inherent resistance in the system to changes to the core </p>
<p>Equipment Programme outside the annual planning rounds. It was very difficult to </p>
<p>reach agreement on the re&#8209;prioritisation of resources as there was no flexibility in </p>
<p>the budget. It required a push from me to do this. I also asked for the Department </p>
<p>to look at rationalising the equipment programme to create a 10&#8209;15% head&#8209;room for </p>
<p>reprioritisation to meet short&#8209;term operational requirements.”</p>
<p>708</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1333. </b> Asked how effective the MOD’s efforts were to draw on core Equipment </p>
<p>Programme funding to support ongoing operations, Lord Drayson wrote:</p>
<p>“… the Services were concerned that their long term programmes would be </p>
<p>cannibalised and lose funding to short term operational needs … it was quite </p>
<p>unusual for core equipment funding to be redirected to operational needs. </p>
<p>This only happened when the military had a strong desire for it …”</p>
