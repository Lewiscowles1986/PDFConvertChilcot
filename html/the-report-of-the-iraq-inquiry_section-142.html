<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses conclusions in relation to the evidence set out in </p>
<p>Section 14.1, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>where there was a failure to address capability gaps in equipment; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact of running two medium scale operations concurrently.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address conclusions in relation to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how equipment was funded, which is addressed in Section 13.2; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the failure to ensure that the UK was adequately prepared for post&#8209;conflict Iraq </p>
<p>contingencies, which is addressed in Section 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD operational policy, or judgements on the specific circumstances in which </p>
<p>individuals lost their lives in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD’s procedure for supporting those killed or injured in Iraq, which is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 16.4.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2009, UK forces in Iraq faced gaps in some key capability </p>
<p>areas, including protected mobility, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition </p>
<p>and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) and helicopter support. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not sufficiently clear which person or department within the MOD </p>
<p>had responsibility for identifying and articulating capability gaps.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Delays in providing adequate medium weight Protected Patrol Vehicles (PPVs) and </p>
<p>the failure to meet the needs of UK forces in Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) </p>
<p>(MND(SE)) for ISTAR and helicopters should not have been tolerated.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD was slow in responding to the developing threat in Iraq from Improvised </p>
<p>Explosive Devices (IEDs). The range of protected mobility options available to </p>
<p>commanders in MND(SE) was limited. Although work had begun before 2002 to </p>
<p>source an additional PPV, it was only ordered in July 2006 following Ministerial </p>
<p>intervention. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Funding was not a direct barrier to the identification and deployment of additional </p>
<p>solutions to the medium weight PPV gap. But it appears that the longer&#8209;term focus </p>
<p>of the Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) on the Future Rapid Effect </p>
<p>System (FRES) programme inhibited it from addressing the more immediate issue </p>
<p>related to medium weight PPV capability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan had a material impact on the availability </p>
<p>of key capabilities for deployment to Iraq, particularly helicopters and ISTAR.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>14.2  |  Conclusions: Military equipment (post&#8209;conflict)</p>
<p>229</p>
<p><b>Addressing post&#8209;invasion capability gaps</b></p>
<p><b>Defining the capabilities required</b></p>
<p>The 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review </i>(SDR) defined the military capabilities needed by the </p>
<p>Armed Forces. It concluded that the UK needed a more effective expeditionary capability, </p>
<p>including “deployable and mobile” forces, with “sufficient protection and firepower for </p>
<p>war&#8209;fighting”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> As a result, the MOD established a requirement for a family of vehicles </p>
<p>to replace existing medium weight armoured vehicles. That was to be delivered through </p>
<p>the Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) programme which was expected to be in service </p>
<p>towards 2010.</p>
<p>The 1998 SDR also emphasised the importance of developing an enhanced Intelligence, </p>
<p>Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) capability. </p>
<p>In 2002, the MOD published <i>The Strategic Defence Review: A New Chapter; </i>an update </p>
<p>on the SDR’s progress and a consideration of the “UK’s defence posture and plans” in </p>
<p>light of the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> <i>A New Chapter </i>again stressed the importance of ISTAR assets: </p>
<p>the MOD would accelerate the Watchkeeper programme which was designed to deliver </p>
<p>an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). That capability was expected in “2005&#8209;06”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>were very few similar capabilities that could be deployed in the interim. By 2003, the </p>
<p>expeditionary capability defined by the 1998 SDR was not yet in place. </p>
<p>A number of witnesses suggested to the Inquiry that the MOD had not been given the </p>
<p>resources to acquire the full range of capabilities specified by the SDR. The Inquiry </p>
<p>has not reached a view on that point. Decisions made by the MOD on the balance </p>
<p>of investment between immediate operational requirements and future defence </p>
<p>programmes in delivering the capabilities set out in the SDR fall outside the Inquiry’s </p>
<p>Terms of Reference. </p>
<p><b>Countering the IED threat</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> By the end of April 2003, barely a month after the invasion, UK forces began to face a </p>
<p>threat from Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). In July and August, more sophisticated </p>
<p>devices were being used with increasing frequency against Coalition Forces. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) predicted that the IED threat was likely to </p>
<p>increase and continue to evolve rapidly. That was clearly indicated in its Assessments </p>
<p>of 3 September 2003, 25 September 2003 and 5 November 2003.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> On 1 September, a Forces and Resources Review reported that the IED threat was </p>
<p>being “countered by the use of stripped&#8209;down Land Rovers with top cover sentries”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It recommended that protection would be improved by the deployment of armoured </p>
<p>4x4 vehicles. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The Protected Patrol Vehicle (PPV) Working Group discussed how to meet that </p>
<p>requirement on 5 September 2003. It was clear that the MOD had few options for the </p>
<p>rapid supply of an armoured 4x4 vehicle. Large numbers of Snatch Land Rovers were </p>
<p>already in service in Northern Ireland and were therefore available for deployment. </p>
<p>There was no other vehicle that could be readily deployed without modification or </p>
<p>without considerable cost. The MOD therefore decided to dispatch 180 Snatch Land </p>
<p>Rovers to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> Several witnesses to the Inquiry referred to working with “what you’ve got” and told </p>
<p>the Inquiry that the Snatch Land Rover was preferable to a completely unprotected </p>
<p>vehicle. The Snatch Land Rover had not been designed, however, for the conditions </p>
<p>found in Iraq; and by 2002 it was at the end of its planned life in service. No programme </p>
<p>to replace it had been agreed. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The Snatch Land Rover was therefore not an optimal solution to the urgent </p>
<p>requirement for an armoured PPV, but was the best available stop&#8209;gap. Given the </p>
<p>need for rapid replacement of completely unprotected vehicles, the decision to </p>
<p>deploy 180 Snatch Land Rovers was fully justifiable. However; this should have been </p>
<p>recognised as no more than an interim solution. Work to find a more effective vehicle </p>
<p>for Iraq and similar environments in the longer term should have been put in hand.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The Snatch Land Rover was modernised and made more suitable for the weather </p>
<p>and terrain of Iraq in several conversion programmes. Because the chassis was </p>
<p>incapable of carrying the weight of additional armour the enhancements which could </p>
<p>be made to its level of physical protection were limited. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> The hardening of a vehicle, or any other type of equipment, is only one component </p>
<p>of its protection. Throughout Operation TELIC, the UK also deployed a suite of </p>
<p>other measures to counter the IED threat, including aerial surveillance, electronic </p>
<p>countermeasures, the deployment and up&#8209;armouring of heavier tracked vehicles, tactical </p>
<p>changes and intelligence&#8209;based targeting of the perpetrators. </p>
<p><b>11. </b> The first IED attack using an Explosively Formed Projectile (EFP) took place in </p>
<p>May 2004. In July 2004, the Defence Intelligence Staff stated that the presence and </p>
<p>use of EFPs in attacks against the Multi&#8209;National Force in Iraq was “a significant force </p>
<p>protection issue”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The MOD’s Directorate of Operational Capability (DOC) concluded in February 2005 </p>
<p>that the Snatch Land Rover conversion programme had been “a belated reaction” to the </p>
<p>IED threat and that sustained investment was necessary to “provide sufficient protected </p>
<p>mobility for operations in hostile environments such as Iraq”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>14.2  |  Conclusions: Military equipment (post&#8209;conflict)</p>
<p>231</p>
<p><b>13. </b> By May 2005, the IED threat had increased significantly. Commanders in </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Division South&#8209;East (MND(SE)) had a choice of two vehicles in which they </p>
<p>could conduct routine patrols: the Snatch Land Rover or the Warrior Armoured Fighting </p>
<p>Vehicle. Those two vehicles were at opposite ends of the protected mobility spectrum, </p>
<p>with very different characteristics and availability. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Lieutenant General James Dutton, General Officer Commanding MND(SE) from </p>
<p>June 2005 to December 2005, explained to the Inquiry that towards the end of 2005 </p>
<p>all movement was conducted by air or in convoys protected by armoured vehicles. </p>
<p>That constrained wider UK operations, including the Security Sector Reform (SSR) </p>
<p>effort, because military personnel, police officers and civilian personnel were frequently </p>
<p>not able to move around MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The impact of limited mobility on SSR was regularly raised in meetings of the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff and the reports of those who visited Iraq (see Section 12.1). The impact </p>
<p>of protective security measures on civilians’ ability to carry out their jobs effectively is </p>
<p>described in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> In June 2006, Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, Chief of Joint Operations, </p>
<p>reported that troops could “manage Snatch – just, but they have no inherent confidence </p>
<p>in it”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> Questions were asked in Parliament about what the MOD was doing to ensure the </p>
<p>best possible protection of its troops. </p>
<p><b>17. </b> The Inquiry recognises that there is not always a solution to an evolving threat and </p>
<p>that, depending on the sophistication of the device and the way in which a vehicle is hit, </p>
<p>any vehicle can be vulnerable to attack. </p>
<p><b>Requirement for a medium weight PPV</b></p>
<p><b>18. </b> In June 2006, Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, commissioned a review </p>
<p>of armoured vehicles in Iraq. The review led to the identification of a requirement for </p>
<p>a medium weight PPV for deployment to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The MOD decided to procure 108 Cougar vehicles which were modified for use </p>
<p>on UK operations. The modified vehicle was called the Mastiff. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The Cougar vehicle had been in service with the US Army since 2004. The British </p>
<p>Army had also deployed a Cougar variant to Bosnia in 2003/04. </p>
<p><b>21. </b> The Mastiff was a wheeled PPV offering better protection than Snatch, but, because </p>
<p>of its size, was not suitable for all patrol tasks. Although it was not an ideal solution, </p>
<p>Mastiff was positively received by troops in Iraq. The first four Mastiffs had reached Iraq </p>
<p>by 30 December 2006.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>22. </b> In April 2008, the Equipment Capability branch (EC) in MND(SE) (the formation of </p>
<p>which is described below) produced an Urgent Statement of User Requirement (USUR) </p>
<p>for an “Urban PPV”. The Ridgback (which was also a variant of Cougar) was ordered </p>
<p>to meet the requirement but did not enter service in time for use in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Neither vehicle was a replacement for the Snatch Land Rover and Ministers </p>
<p>continued to receive advice that Snatch remained “mission critical”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> in Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan because of its profile, manoeuvrability and carrying capacity. Lt Gen </p>
<p>Houghton considered that removing it from theatre would have a significant impact </p>
<p>on operations by reducing patrols’ situational awareness and restricting movement. </p>
<p>A FAILURE TO ARTICULATE THE REQUIREMENT</p>
<p><b>24. </b> MOD officials explained to Mr Browne on 21 July 2006 that work was ongoing within </p>
<p>the department to source a medium weight PPV and that the armoured vehicle review </p>
<p>had accelerated the work by securing additional funding. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> The Inquiry has considered why it took so long to fill a capability gap that was </p>
<p>apparent from the end of 2003.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Within the MOD and the Armed Forces the responsibility for meeting an equipment </p>
<p>capability gap during Op TELIC was clear: USURs for new equipment were forwarded </p>
<p>to the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), which retained ownership of the USUR </p>
<p>until it was signed off. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> What was unclear was where responsibility lay for identifying and articulating </p>
<p>capability gaps. Because a USUR could be raised by “any user”,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> there was no single </p>
<p>individual or team accountable if an essential USUR was not raised. That was a failure </p>
<p>of the system. In a statement to the Inquiry, the MOD said that there was “no simple </p>
<p>answer to the question where the primary responsibility for identifying capability gaps </p>
<p>and raising USURs lay” during the post&#8209;invasion phase. </p>
<p><b>28. </b> The evidence suggests that this was not a problem in every instance. When a gap </p>
<p>was clearly identified and there was an appetite to address it, action was taken. That </p>
<p>was demonstrated by the deployment of electronic countermeasures and enhancements </p>
<p>for the protection of Warrior and FV430 vehicles. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> An analysis of the land operation in Iraq published in August 2010 (known as </p>
<p>“the Barry Report”) stated that a requirement was more likely to be identified, and the </p>
<p>subsequent Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) to succeed, where there was </p>
<p>“a strong coherent sponsor in the Army or MOD”.</p>

<p>14.2  |  Conclusions: Military equipment (post&#8209;conflict)</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>30. </b> T</p>
<p>he Barry Report suggested that, where UORs succeeded, “some of these were the </p>
<p>result of ‘pull’ from theatre, others the result of ‘push’ from equipment staff in the MOD. The </p>
<p>latter was the case with Mastiff, the requirement for which was formulated in London.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>31. </b> As the Box ‘Attempts to articulate the PPV requirement’ below describes, there </p>
<p>were repeated references within the MOD to lack of a coherent strategy and the </p>
<p>absence of what was known as a “Customer Two lead”:</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> someone whose role it was </p>
<p>to identify such a requirement from the perspective of a ‘user’. In the absence of a </p>
<p>strong sponsor, defining the PPV requirement failed to make progress for three years.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Before June 2006, the MOD’s consideration of protected mobility lacked the </p>
<p>leadership that was ultimately injected by Mr Browne’s armoured vehicle review and </p>
<p>driven forward by Lord Drayson, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister </p>
<p>for Defence Procurement. </p>
<p><b>Attempts to articulate the PPV requirement</b></p>
<p>The 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review </i>did not identify a requirement for a light or medium </p>
<p>weight PPV for expeditionary operations.</p>
<p>The PPVs in service with the Army in 1998, primarily to meet the requirements of </p>
<p>operations in Northern Ireland, were Tavern and the Snatch Land Rover. The Out of </p>
<p>Service Date for the Snatch Land Rover was 2002.</p>
<p><b>January 2002 </b>– A draft Urgent Statement of User Requirement (USUR) for the </p>
<p>replacement of the Snatch Land Rover was produced (Project DUCKBOARD).</p>
<p><b>July to September 2003</b> – The MOD held two workshops and produced an operational </p>
<p>analysis of the requirement but stated that further work was needed to articulate it.</p>
<p><b>February 2004</b> – Funding re&#8209;profiled to bring forward the delivery of 80 vehicles from </p>
<p>2007 to 2004. </p>
<p><b>31 March 2004 </b>– A requirement for an expeditionary vehicle to be deployed to the </p>
<p>“rest</p>
<p> </p>
<p>of</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the world” was identified but the MOD stated further work was needed to define it. </p>
<p>It became known as the Type B vehicle.</p>
<p><b>June 2004</b> – The Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) was advised of a </p>
<p>need for a coherent plan to deliver protected mobility for both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p><b>7 July 2004 </b>– The MOD identified a requirement for three separate vehicle projects, </p>
<p>including the Type B vehicle, but described the way forward as “beset with unresolved </p>
<p>issues”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> including a lack of definition over the capabilities required and number of </p>
<p>vehicles needed.</p>
<p><b>15 October 2004 </b>– A strategy for delivering the three projects was produced but there </p>
<p>was still no concept of operations or a clear Customer Two lead. </p>

<p>ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p><b>33. </b> The Inquiry recognises that, during the period covered by its Terms of Reference, </p>
<p>there were a number of attempts to improve the process through which equipment </p>
<p>requirements were identified and articulated.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> Attempts to make improvements to the process began in 2005. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> In February 2005, an Equipment Capability (EC) branch was created in theatre. </p>
<p>It enhanced communication between those in need of new capabilities and those who </p>
<p>helped to articulate the requirements, although there was some lack of clarity regarding </p>
<p>the EC cell’s precise role.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> In November 2006, Lt Gen Houghton recognised that the UK needed “to improve </p>
<p>our processes for identifying the EC dimension of emerging theatre CONOPS [concept </p>
<p>of operations] which lay in the domain of the early years of the EP [Equipment </p>
<p>Programme] rather than in the UOR process.”</p>

<p>14.2  |  Conclusions: Military equipment (post&#8209;conflict)</p>
<p>235</p>
<p><b>37. </b> In March 2007, the report of a visit to Iraq by Lord Drayson, then the Minister of </p>
<p>State for Defence Equipment and Support, prompted work to improve communication </p>
<p>channels between the MOD and theatre. </p>
<p><b>38. </b> Lord Drayson reported that “overall there was a clear perception in theatre that the </p>
<p>UK MOD was not taking account of the rate of change. UORs too often sought to deliver </p>
<p>a perfect capability, but in doing so delivered so late the requirement had changed or </p>
<p>theatre were without any capability for too long”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> He suggested that “greater dialogue” </p>
<p>between theatre and the Equipment Capability Customer could help to address the issue.</p>
<p><b>39. </b> In September 2007, following an “extensive review and analysis”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> of the UK’s force </p>
<p>protection capability, the DOC concluded that management of force protection risk must </p>
<p>be based “on a thorough identification of strategic and operational threats to ensure </p>
<p>that a balance of research, investment and training was achieved commensurate with </p>
<p>the threat”. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> As a result, a force protection policy was produced in November 2007 which sought </p>
<p>to apply a standard approach to the risk assessment of force protection and lay out the </p>
<p>respective roles and responsibilities across the MOD. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that the force protection policy in use in 2015 “defines </p>
<p>risk ownership and governance more clearly than its predecessors”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> and that the </p>
<p>policy had been integrated into wider MOD risk management processes which had </p>
<p>also been revised.</p>
<p>FUNDING AND THE FUTURE RAPID EFFECT SYSTEM (FRES)</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Lord Drayson told the Inquiry that he believed “the Army’s difficulty in deciding upon </p>
<p>a replacement to Snatch was in part caused by their concern over the likelihood of </p>
<p>FRES budgets being cut to fund a Snatch replacement vehicle”.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Although the Inquiry has identified issues concerning clarity of responsibility and </p>
<p>communication, it has not found evidence to suggest that funding was a direct barrier </p>
<p>to the identification and deployment of additional solutions to the PPV capability gap.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> It is possible, however, that the need to preserve funding for the Future Rapid Effect </p>
<p>System (FRES) programme influenced decisions on the requirement for PPVs. </p>
<p><b>45. </b> The FRES programme remained distinct from meeting the requirement for an </p>
<p>appropriate PPV in Iraq. FRES was never intended to be in service until towards 2010. </p>
<p>However, a number of witnesses to the Inquiry made the point that, within a finite </p>
<p>budget, resources for an additional requirement would have to be found from elsewhere </p>

<p>in the defence programme (except when provided from UORs or USURs funded by </p>
<p>a claim on the Reserve – see Section 13.1). Sir Peter Spencer, Chief of Defence </p>
<p>Procurement from May 2003 to April 2007, told the Inquiry that using money from the </p>
<p>capital Equipment Programme to deal with the short term had “a fratricidal effect”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> on </p>
<p>the ability to move the FRES programme forward. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> The focus of the Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) on the FRES </p>
<p>programme may therefore provide a partial explanation for the lack of urgency in </p>
<p>addressing the more immediate problem of the PPV capability gap. Another likely </p>
<p>factor was an over&#8209;optimistic assumption about the timing of withdrawal from Iraq. </p>
<p>The expectation of an early withdrawal from Iraq inhibited action on an expensive </p>
<p>programme that might not be completed before troops left.</p>
<p><b>Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance </b></p>
<p><b>(ISTAR)</b></p>
<p><b>47. </b> The MOD was aware before 2003 that it needed to broaden the capabilities </p>
<p>available for collecting strategic, operational and tactical intelligence. A clear capability </p>
<p>gap for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to be directed by commanders on the ground </p>
<p>had been identified. The longer&#8209;term solution was a programme known as Watchkeeper, </p>
<p>expected to be introduced in 2005 to 2006. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> From March 2003, the Phoenix UAV was available to commanders in theatre. </p>
<p>It performed well during the invasion but could only be used between November and </p>
<p>April because it was not designed to operate in high temperatures. </p>
<p><b>49. </b> For the first four years of Op TELIC, the lack of ISTAR capabilities constrained </p>
<p>military operations. The final DOC report on Op TELIC in March 2010 stated that an </p>
<p>enduring intelligence picture had been lacking for “at least the first four years”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> because </p>
<p>“up to and throughout 2006 and into 2007, there were insufficient ISTAR assets available </p>
<p>to MND(SE), and hence by necessity they were focused on maintaining as much of the </p>
<p>day&#8209;to&#8209;day tactical picture as possible”.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> There is evidence that the MOD took two steps which did not adequately meet the </p>
<p>capability gap:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “mini UAV”, Desert Hawk 1, was introduced in December 2003. Because of </p>
<p>technical limitations it was only in theatre for a very short period.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A Combined Joint Predator UAV Task Force (CJPTF) was created with the US </p>
<p>in January 2004 but the UK’s requests for access to the capability were often </p>
<p>not met.</p>

<p>14.2  |  Conclusions: Military equipment (post&#8209;conflict)</p>
<p>237</p>
<p><b>51. </b> As Major General William Rollo, General Officer Commanding MND(SE) </p>
<p>(GOC MND(SE)) from July 2004 to December 2004, reported at the end of his tour, the </p>
<p>consequence of that capability gap was that operations were “planned around ISTAR </p>
<p>availability, rather than ISTAR being available for operations”.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>52. </b> The DOC raised the problem in its three reports covering the post&#8209;conflict phase, </p>
<p>each of which was discussed by the Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> In February 2005, the DOC stated that ISTAR was “the most significant capability </p>
<p>shortfall” of the post&#8209;conflict phase and it was “likely to remain an enduring requirement, </p>
<p>particularly for asymmetric warfare”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>54. </b> In April 2006, the DOC stated that “a serious gap in current ISTAR capability” had </p>
<p>been “a regular DOC observation” that had “been highlighted on all recent operations”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That prompted a more wide&#8209;ranging debate across the MOD about how the ISTAR </p>
<p>capability gap could be addressed. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> As in the case of protected mobility, the MOD was slow to respond to the </p>
<p>deficiencies identified in ISTAR and showed a lack of understanding of the requirement </p>
<p>for an enduring operation. The provision of ISTAR capabilities also suffered from the </p>
<p>absence of a clearly identified sponsor addressing the capability gap. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> Lt Gen Houghton’s review of ISTAR shortfalls in May 2006 stated that the UK was </p>
<p>“only beginning to develop a full understanding of the national ISTAR requirements” </p>
<p>for transition in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Major General Richard Shirreff, GOC MND(SE) from June 2006 to January 2007, </p>
<p>wrote in his post&#8209;operation report that the UK’s response was “grindingly slow and </p>
<p>ponderous” when compared with the US and Australia. They had shown more “agility </p>
<p>and forethought” in identifying solutions.</p>
<p>25</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>The pressure of running two medium scale operations </b></p>
<p><b>concurrently</b></p>
<p><b>59. </b> In 2002, an MOD review of the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review </i>(SDR) reaffirmed </p>
<p>that the UK’s Armed Forces were not equipped to support two enduring medium scale </p>
<p>military operations at the same time:</p>
<p>“Since the SDR we have assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake </p>
<p>either a single major operation (of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to </p>
<p>the Gulf War in 1990&#8209;91), or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on </p>
<p>a lesser scale (as in the mid&#8209;1990s in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount </p>
<p>a second substantial deployment … if this were made necessary by a second crisis. </p>
<p>We would not, however, expect both deployments to involve war&#8209;fighting or to </p>
<p>maintain them simultaneously for longer than 6 months.”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Between 2004 and 2006, the MOD regularly made reference to the impact that an </p>
<p>additional deployment would have on key capabilities available for Iraq. Choices would </p>
<p>have to be made in deploying a finite level of capability.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> When the Defence and Overseas Policy Sub&#8209;Committee of Cabinet agreed in </p>
<p>July 2005 to deploy around 2,500 personnel to Helmand province, Afghanistan, the UK </p>
<p>was still engaged in a medium scale operation in Iraq. As set out in Section 9.8, the </p>
<p>assumptions about when personnel might be withdrawn from Iraq were high risk. </p>
<p><b>62. </b> In March 2010, the DOC recognised that running two medium scale operations </p>
<p>concurrently had had a “profound and fundamental impact” on resources afforded to </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> It concluded that “knowingly exceeding Defence Planning Assumptions requires </p>
<p>the most rigorous analysis”. The Inquiry has not seen evidence of such analysis.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> It is difficult to determine whether or not Ministers adequately appreciated what the </p>
<p>July 2005 decision to deploy to Helmand meant for the capabilities available for Iraq. </p>
<p>There were discussions about the over&#8209;stretch and pinch&#8209;points in provision but those </p>
<p>were no substitute for the “rigorous analysis” to which the DOC referred.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Decisions were not based on a realistic assessment of the likely duration of either </p>
<p>operation and were consequently flawed.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> One example was the decision not to harden accommodation for British troops in </p>
<p>Iraq in March 2005. That decision was supported by balanced and pragmatic advice but </p>
<p>the UK’s optimistic assessment of how soon operations in Iraq would conclude affected </p>
<p>its analysis of the requirement. That meant that the issue had to be re&#8209;opened three </p>
<p>years later when it was too late for the matter to be addressed in an appropriate and </p>
<p>cost&#8209;effective way.</p>

<p>14.2  |  Conclusions: Military equipment (post&#8209;conflict)</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>SUPPORT HELICOPTERS</p>
<p><b>66. </b> The availability of support helicopters in MND(SE) was constantly stretched because </p>
<p>of two factors. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> The first was that support helicopters were used to supplement other shortfalls. </p>
<p>Support helicopters were needed to move personnel by air when circumstances were </p>
<p>too dangerous for ground transport. However, the same helicopters were also required </p>
<p>for surveillance in the absence of sufficient ISTAR capability. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> That meant that commanders were faced with a conflict between two requirements, </p>
<p>and the need to compromise effectiveness.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> As General Sir Richard Dannatt, Commander in Chief Land Command, wrote,  </p>
<p>there is an “inextricable” link between ISTAR, protected mobility and helicopters:  </p>
<p>“When the two former capabilities are under stress … we invariably place a higher </p>
<p>call on the latter.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>70. </b> The second factor was Afghanistan. Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of </p>
<p>the Air Staff, anticipated in February 2004 that support helicopters would be “seriously </p>
<p>stretched”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> by increased involvement in Afghanistan. His prediction was borne out.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Reports from Iraq in the second half of 2005 stressed the need for more helicopters. </p>
<p>General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, stated in October that the fleet was </p>
<p>“creaking badly”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> In December, Major General James Dutton, GOC MND(SE) between </p>
<p>June 2005 and December 2005, wrote that “the simple fact is that we need more </p>
<p>helicopters (and aircrew) urgently”.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>72. </b> The DOC wrote in April 2006 that capacity had “become parlous at times during </p>
<p>2005”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> It added that the Joint Helicopter Force (Iraq) had “struggled to meet its tasks </p>
<p>even with rigorous prioritisation” and the UK’s battlefield helicopter force “was stretched </p>
<p>to meet the requirement of the current operation”.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> In June 2006, Lt Gen Houghton stated that there was an endorsed requirement </p>
<p>to increase helicopter provision for Afghanistan but not for Iraq. He acknowledged </p>
<p>that operations had at times been constrained by a lack of helicopter support. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Houghton concluded:</p>
<p>“With no reductions on the horizon in Op TELIC and escalating requirements </p>
<p>in Op HERRICK [Afghanistan], our national aviation requirements now need </p>

<p>departmental scrutiny to determine the concurrent requirement to resource both </p>
<p>theatres and define how our national aviation resources should be realigned.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Browne and Lord Drayson intervened in August 2006. Lord Drayson told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that he had asked Mr Browne to authorise him “to explore whether helicopters </p>
<p>could be found quickly and to worry about how they would be funded after we had </p>
<p>identified a possible solution”.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>75. </b> An exchange between Mr Browne and General Sir Timothy Granville&#8209;Chapman, </p>
<p>Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, on 7 September illustrated how Ministers injected </p>
<p>urgency into addressing equipment shortfalls. When Gen Granville&#8209;Chapman suggested </p>
<p>that options to add capability would be considered in October, Mr Browne responded: </p>
<p>“No: it should happen tomorrow!”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>76. </b> That prompted a review of what short&#8209;term relief could be offered to improve </p>
<p>helicopter availability. In December 2007, Mr Browne wrote that helicopter support </p>
<p>to Iraq was “generally assessed as satisfactory”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> and that the priority was therefore </p>
<p>Afghanistan. The Inquiry has not seen any evidence to suggest that that assessment </p>
<p>was reconsidered for the remainder of Op TELIC.</p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>77. </b> In deciding to undertake concurrent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the UK </p>
<p>knowingly exceeded the Defence Planning Assumptions. All resources from that point </p>
<p>onwards were going to be stretched. Any decision which commits the UK to extended </p>
<p>operations in excess of the Defence Planning Assumptions should be based on the most </p>
<p>rigorous analysis of its potential implications, including for the availability of relevant </p>
<p>capabilities for UK forces. </p>
<p><b>78. </b> At the start of Op TELIC, the MOD knew that it had capability gaps in relation </p>
<p>to protected mobility and ISTAR and that either could have a significant impact on </p>
<p>operations. Known gaps in such capabilities should always be clearly communicated </p>
<p>to Ministers.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The MOD should be pro&#8209;active in seeking to understand and articulate new or </p>
<p>additional equipment requirements. The MOD told the Inquiry that there was no simple </p>
<p>answer to the question of where the primary responsibility for identifying capability gaps </p>
<p>lay during Op TELIC. That is unacceptable. The roles and responsibilities for identifying </p>
<p>and articulating capability gaps in enduring operations must be clearly defined, </p>
<p>communicated and understood by those concerned. It is possible that this has been </p>
<p>addressed after the period covered by this Inquiry. </p>

<p>241</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Those responsible for making decisions on the investment in military capabilities </p>
<p>should continually evaluate whether the balance between current operational </p>
<p>requirements and long&#8209;term defence programmes is right, particularly to meet </p>
<p>an evolving threat on current operations.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> During the first four years of Op TELIC, there was no clear statement of policy </p>
<p>setting out the level of acceptable risk to UK forces and who was responsible for </p>
<p>managing that risk. The MOD has suggested to the Inquiry that successive policies </p>
<p>defining risk ownership and governance more clearly have addressed that absence, </p>
<p>and that wider MOD risk management processes have also been revised. In any future </p>
<p>operation the level of force protection required to meet the assessed threat needs to </p>
