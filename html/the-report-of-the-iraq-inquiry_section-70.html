<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>572</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>1.  After the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 and the fall of the Taliban </b></p>
<p><b>regime in Afghanistan in November, the US Administration turned its attention to </b></p>
<p><b>regime change in Iraq as part of the second phase of what it called the Global War </b></p>
<p><b>on Terror.</b></p>
<p><b>2.  The UK Government sought to influence the decisions of the US Administration </b></p>
<p><b>and avoid unilateral US military action on Iraq by offering partnership to the US </b></p>
<p><b>and seeking to build international support for the position that Iraq was a threat </b></p>
<p><b>with which it was necessary to deal.</b></p>
<p><b>3.  In Mr Blair’s view, the decision to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US </b></p>
<p><b>was an essential demonstration of solidarity with the UK’s principal ally as well </b></p>
<p><b>as being in the UK’s long-term national interests.</b></p>
<p><b>4.  To do so required the UK to reconcile its objective of disarming Iraq, if possible </b></p>
<p><b>by peaceful means, with the US goal of regime change. That was achieved by </b></p>
<p><b>the development of an ultimatum strategy threatening the use of force if Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein did not comply with the demands of the international community, and by </b></p>
<p><b>seeking to persuade the US to adopt that strategy and pursue it through the UN.</b></p>
<p><b>5.  President Bush’s decision, in September 2002, to challenge the UN to deal with </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq, and the subsequent successful negotiation of resolution 1441 giving Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations or face serious </b></p>
<p><b>consequences if it did not, was perceived to be a major success for Mr Blair’s </b></p>
<p><b>strategy and his influence on President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>6.  But US willingness to act through the UN was limited. Following the Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>declaration of 7 December 2002, the UK perceived that President Bush had </b></p>
<p><b>decided that the US would take military action in early 2003 if Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>had not been disarmed and was still in power.</b></p>
<p><b>7.  The timing of military action was entirely driven by the US Administration.</b></p>
<p><b>8.  At the end of January 2003, Mr Blair accepted the US timetable for military </b></p>
<p><b>action by mid-March. President Bush agreed to support a second resolution </b></p>
<p><b>to help Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>9.  The UK Government’s efforts to secure a second resolution faced opposition </b></p>
<p><b>from those countries, notably France, Germany and Russia, which believed </b></p>
<p><b>that the inspections process could continue. The inspectors reported that Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>co-operation, while far from perfect, was improving.</b></p>
<p><b>10.  By early March, the US Administration was not prepared to allow inspections </b></p>
<p><b>to continue or give Mr Blair more time to try to achieve support for action. </b></p>
<p><b>The attempt to gain support for a second resolution was abandoned.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>573</p>
<p><b>11.  In the Inquiry’s view, the diplomatic options had not at that stage been </b></p>
<p><b>exhausted. Military action was therefore not a last resort.</b></p>
<p><b>12.  In mid-March, Mr Blair’s determination to stand alongside the US left the UK </b></p>
<p><b>with a stark choice. It could act with the US but without the support of the majority </b></p>
<p><b>of the Security Council in taking military action if Saddam Hussein did not accept </b></p>
<p><b>the US ultimatum giving him 48 hours to leave. Or it could choose not to join </b></p>
<p><b>US-led military action.</b></p>
<p><b>13.  Led by Mr Blair, the UK Government chose to support military action.</b></p>
<p><b>14.  Mr Blair asked Parliament to endorse a decision to invade and occupy a </b></p>
<p><b>sovereign nation, without the support of a Security Council resolution explicitly </b></p>
<p><b>authorising the use of force. Parliament endorsed that choice.</b></p>
<p><b>15.  This Section sets out how the choices made by the UK Government resulted </b></p>
<p><b>in that outcome.</b></p>
<p><b>The UK decision to support US military action</b></p>
<p><b>16. </b> President Bush decided at the end of 2001 to pursue a policy of regime change </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The UK shared the broad objective of finding a way to deal with Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and his assumed weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction (WMD) programmes. However, based on consistent legal advice, the UK </p>
<p>could not share the US objective of regime change. The UK Government therefore set </p>
<p>as its objective the disarmament of Iraq in accordance with the obligations imposed in </p>
<p>a series of Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p><b>UK policy before 9/11</b></p>
<p><b>18. </b> Before the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 (9/11), the UK was pursuing </p>
<p>a strategy of containment based on a new sanctions regime to improve international </p>
<p>support and incentivise Iraq’s co-operation, narrowing and deepening the sanctions </p>
<p>regime to focus only on prohibited items and at the same time improving financial </p>
<p>controls to reduce the flow of illicit funds to Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> When UK policy towards Iraq was formally reviewed and agreed by the Ministerial </p>
<p>Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy (DOP) in May 1999, the objectives towards </p>
<p>Iraq were defined as:</p>
<p>“… in the short term, to reduce the threat Saddam [Hussein] poses to the region </p>
<p>including by eliminating his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes; </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>and, in the longer term, to reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law-abiding </p>
<p>member of the international community.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>20. </b> The policy of containment was seen as the “only viable way” to pursue those </p>
<p>objectives. A “policy of trying to topple Saddam would command no useful international </p>
<p>support”. Iraq was unlikely to accept the package immediately but “might be persuaded </p>
<p>to acquiesce eventually”.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> After prolonged discussion about the way ahead, the UN Security Council adopted </p>
<p>resolution 1284 in December 1999, although China, France and Russia abstained.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The resolution established:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new inspectorate, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection </p>
<p>Commission (UNMOVIC) (which Dr Hans Blix was subsequently appointed </p>
<p>to lead);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a timetable to identify and agree a work programme; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>and the principle that, if the inspectors reported co-operation in key areas, </p>
<p>that would lead to the suspension of economic sanctions.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Resolution 1284 described Iraq’s obligations to comply with the disarmament </p>
<p>standards of resolution 687 and other related resolutions as the “governing standard </p>
<p>of Iraqi compliance”; and provided that the Security Council would decide what was </p>
<p>required of Iraq for the implementation of each task and that it should be “clearly defined </p>
<p>and precise”.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The resolution was also a deliberate compromise which changed the criterion for </p>
<p>the suspension, and eventual lifting, of sanctions from complete disarmament to tests </p>
<p>which would be based on judgements by UNMOVIC on the progress made in completing </p>
<p>identified tasks.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Iraq refused to accept the provisions of resolution 1284, including the re-admission </p>
<p>of weapons inspectors. Concerns about Iraq’s activities in the absence of inspectors </p>
<p>increased.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> The US Presidential election in November 2000 prompted a further UK review of the </p>
<p>operation of the containment policy (see Section 1.2). There were concerns about how </p>
<p>long the policy could be sustained and what it could achieve.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> There were also concerns over both the continued legal basis for operations in the </p>
<p>No-Fly Zones (NFZs) and the conduct of individual operations.</p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>575</p>
<p><b>28. </b> In an Assessment on 1 November, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) judged </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein felt “<b>little pressure to negotiate</b> over … resolution 1284 because </p>
<p>the proceeds of oil smuggling and illicit trade have increased significantly this year, and </p>
<p>more countries are increasing diplomatic contacts and trade with Iraq”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The JIC also judged:</p>
<p>“Saddam would only contemplate co-operation with [resolution] 1284, and the </p>
<p>return of inspectors … if it could be portrayed as a victory. He will not agree to </p>
<p>co-operate unless:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there is a <b>UN-agreed timetable for the lifting of sanctions</b>. Saddam </p>
<p>suspects that the US would not agree to sanctions lift while he remained </p>
<p>in power;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>he is able to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the inspection </b></p>
<p><b>provisions</b>. His ambitions to rebuild Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>programmes makes him hostile to intrusive inspections or any other </p>
<p>constraints likely to be effective.</p>
<p>“Before accepting 1284, Saddam will try to obtain the abolition of the No-Fly Zones. </p>
<p>He is also likely to demand that the US should abandon its stated aim to topple the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime.”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> In November 2000, Mr Blair’s “preferred option” was described as the </p>
<p>implementation of 1284, enabling inspectors to return and sanctions to be suspended.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>31. </b> In December 2000, the British Embassy Washington reported growing pressure </p>
<p>to change course from containment to military action to oust Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>but no decision to change policy or to begin military planning had been taken by </p>
<p>President Clinton.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>32. </b> The Key Judgements of a JIC Assessment in February 2001 included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “broad international consensus to <b>maintain the arms embargo</b> </p>
<p>at least as long as Saddam remains in power. <b>Saddam faces no economic </b></p>
<p><b>pressure to accept</b> … [resolution] <b>1284 because he is successfully </b></p>
<p><b>undermining the economic sanctions regime</b>.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Through abuse of the UN Oil-for-Food [OFF] programme and smuggling of </p>
<p>oil and other goods” it was estimated that Saddam Hussein would “<b>be able to </b></p>
<p><b>appropriate in the region of $1.5bn to $1.8bn in cash and goods in 2001</b>”, </p>
<p>and there was “scope for earning even more”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>576</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Iranian</b> interdiction efforts” had “<b>significantly reduced smuggling down </b></p>
<p><b>the Gulf</b>”, but Saddam Hussein had “compensated by <b>exploiting land routes</b> </p>
<p>to Turkey and Syria”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Most countries</b>” believed that economic sanctions were “<b>ineffective, </b></p>
<p><b>counterproductive and should now be lifted</b>. Without active enforcement, </p>
<p>the economic sanctions regime” would “continue to erode”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>33. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein needed funds “to maintain his military and security apparatus </p>
<p>and secure its loyalty”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite the availability of funds, Iraq had been slow to comply with UN </p>
<p>recommendations on food allocation. Saddam needed “<b>the Iraqi people to </b></p>
<p><b>suffer to underpin his campaign against sanctions</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Encouraged by the success of Iraq’s border trade agreement with Turkey, “<b>front-</b></p>
<p><b>line states</b>” were “<b>not enforcing sanctions</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been a “<b>significant increase in the erosion of sanctions</b> over the </p>
<p>past six months”.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> When Mr Blair had his first meeting with President Bush at Camp David in late </p>
<p>February 2001, the US and UK agreed on the need for a policy which was more widely </p>
<p>supported in the Middle East region.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Mr Blair had concluded that public presentation </p>
<p>needed to be improved. He suggested that the approach should be presented as a </p>
<p>“deal” comprising four elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>do the right thing by the Iraqi people, with whom we have no quarrel;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tighten weapons controls on Saddam Hussein;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>retain financial control on Saddam Hussein; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>retain our ability to strike.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The stated position of the UK Government in February 2001 was that containment </p>
<p>had been broadly successful.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>36. </b> During the summer of 2001, the UK had been exploring the way forward with the </p>
<p>US, Russia and France on a draft Security Council resolution to put in place a “smart </p>
<p>sanctions” regime.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> But there was no agreement on the way ahead between the UK, the </p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>577</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, until 11 September 2001, the UK had a policy </p>
<p>of containment, but sanctions were eroding.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> The policy was “partially successful”, </p>
<p>but it did not mean that Saddam Hussein was “not still developing his [prohibited] </p>
<p>programmes”.</p>
<p><b>The impact of 9/11</b></p>
<p><b>38. </b> The attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 changed perceptions about the </p>
<p>severity and likelihood of the threat from international terrorism. They showed that </p>
<p>attacks intended to cause large-scale civilian casualties could be mounted anywhere </p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p><b>39. </b> In response to that perception of a greater threat, governments felt a responsibility </p>
<p>to act to anticipate and reduce risks before they turned into a threat. That was described </p>
<p>to the Inquiry by a number of witnesses as a change to the “calculus of risk” after 9/11.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> In the wake of the attacks, Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand “shoulder </p>
<p>to shoulder” with the US to defeat and eradicate international terrorism.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>41. </b> The JIC assessed on 18 September that the attacks on the US had “set a new </p>
<p>benchmark for terrorist atrocity”, and that terrorists seeking comparable impact might </p>
<p>try to use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear devices.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Only Islamic extremists </p>
<p>such as those who shared Usama Bin Laden’s agenda had the motivation to pursue </p>
<p>attacks with the deliberate aim of causing maximum casualties.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Throughout the autumn of 2001, Mr Blair took an active and leading role in </p>
<p>building a coalition to act against that threat, including military action against Al Qaida </p>
<p>and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. He also emphasised the potential risk of </p>
<p>terrorists acquiring and using nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, and the dangers </p>
<p>of inaction.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> In November 2001, the JIC assessed that Iraq had played no role in the 9/11 attacks </p>
<p>on the US and that practical co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was “unlikely”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was no “credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related technology and </p>
<p>expertise to terrorist groups”. It was possible that Iraq might use WMD in terrorist </p>
<p>attacks, but only if the regime was under serious and imminent threat of collapse.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> The UK continued actively to pursue a strengthened policy of containing Iraq, </p>
<p>through a revised and more targeted sanctions regime and seeking Iraq’s agreement </p>
<p>to the return of inspectors as required by resolution 1284 (1999).</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>578</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The adoption on 29 November 2001 of resolution 1382 went some way towards that </p>
<p>objective. But support for economic sanctions was eroding and whether Iraq would ever </p>
<p>agree to re-admit weapons inspectors and allow them to operate without obstruction was </p>
<p>in doubt.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Although there was no evidence of links between Iraq and Al Qaida, Mr Blair </p>
<p>encouraged President Bush to address the issue of Iraq in the context of a wider </p>
<p>strategy to confront terrorism after the attacks of 9/11. He sought to prevent precipitate </p>
<p>military action by the US which he considered would undermine the success of the </p>
<p>coalition which had been established for action against international terrorism.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> President Bush’s remarks</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> on 26 November renewed UK concerns that US </p>
<p>attention was turning towards military action in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Following a discussion with President Bush on 3 December, Mr Blair sent him </p>
<p>a paper on a second phase of the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>49. </b> On Iraq, Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq. This would build </p>
<p>over time until the point was reached where “military action could be taken if necessary”, </p>
<p>without losing international support.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> The strategy was based on the premise that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt </p>
<p>with and it had multiple diplomatic strands. It entailed renewed demands for Iraq to </p>
<p>comply with the obligations imposed by the Security Council and for the re-admission </p>
<p>of weapons inspectors, and a readiness to respond firmly if Saddam Hussein failed </p>
<p>to comply.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Mr Blair did not, at that stage, have a ground invasion of Iraq or immediate military </p>
<p>action of any sort in mind. The strategy included mounting covert operations in support </p>
<p>of those “with the ability to topple Saddam”. But Mr Blair did state that, when a rebellion </p>
<p>occurred, the US and UK should “back it militarily”.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> That was the first step towards a policy of possible intervention in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> A number of issues, including the legal basis for any military action, would need </p>
<p>to be resolved as part of developing the strategy.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> The UK Government does not appear to have had any knowledge at that stage that </p>
<p>President Bush had asked General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief, US Central </p>
<p>Command, to review the military options for removing Saddam Hussein, including </p>
<p>options for a conventional ground invasion.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Mr Blair also emphasised the threat which Iraq might pose in the future. That </p>
<p>remained a key part of his position in the months that followed.</p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>579</p>
<p><b>56. </b> In his annual State of the Union speech on 29 January 2002, President Bush </p>
<p>described the regimes in North Korea and Iran as “sponsors of terrorism”.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> He added </p>
<p>that Iraq had continued to:</p>
<p>“… flaunt its hostility towards America and to support terror … The Iraqi regime has </p>
<p>plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. </p>
<p>This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own </p>
<p>citizens … This is a regime that agreed to international inspections – then kicked out </p>
<p>the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.”</p>
<p><b>57. </b> President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“States like these [North Korea, Iran and Iraq], and their terrorist allies, constitute an </p>
<p>axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.”</p>
<p><b>58.  From late February 2002, Mr Blair and Mr Straw began publicly to argue </b></p>
<p><b>that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with. Iraq needed to disarm or </b></p>
<p><b>be disarmed.</b></p>
<p><b>59. </b> The urgency and certainty with which the position was stated reflected the </p>
<p>ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and biological warfare </p>
<p>capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its capabilities, </p>
<p>including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was pursuing an active </p>
<p>policy of deception and concealment. It also reflected the wider context in which the </p>
<p>policy was being discussed with the US.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> On 26 February 2002, Sir Richard Dearlove, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence </p>
<p>Service, advised that the US Administration had concluded that containment would </p>
<p>not work, was drawing up plans for a military campaign later in the year, and was </p>
<p>considering presenting Saddam Hussein with an ultimatum for the return of inspectors </p>
<p>while setting the bar “so high that Saddam Hussein would be unable to comply”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>61. </b> The following day the JIC assessed that Saddam Hussein feared a US military </p>
<p>attack on the scale of the 1991 military campaign to liberate Kuwait but did not regard </p>
<p>such an attack as inevitable; and that Iraqi opposition groups would not act without </p>
<p>“visible and sustained US military support on the ground”.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>62. </b> At Cabinet on 7 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw emphasised that no decisions </p>
<p>to launch further military action had been taken and any action taken would be </p>
<p>in accordance with international law.</p>

<p>580</p>
<p><b>63. </b> The discussion in Cabinet was couched in terms of Iraq’s need to comply with its </p>
<p>obligations, and future choices by the international community on how to respond to the </p>
<p>threat which Iraq represented.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Cabinet endorsed the conclusion that Iraq’s WMD programmes posed a threat to </p>
<p>peace and endorsed a strategy of engaging closely with the US Government in order </p>
<p>to shape policy and its presentation. It did not discuss how that might be achieved.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr Blair sought and was given information on a range of issues before his meeting </p>
<p>with President Bush at Crawford on 5 and 6 April. But no formal and agreed analysis </p>
<p>of the issues and options was sought or produced, and there was no collective </p>
<p>consideration of such advice.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Mr Straw’s advice of 25 March proposed that the US and UK should seek an </p>
<p>ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to re-admit weapons inspectors.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> That would provide </p>
<p>a route for the UK to align itself with the US without adopting the US objective of regime </p>
<p>change. This reflected advice that regime change would be unlawful.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> At Crawford, Mr Blair offered President Bush a partnership in dealing urgently with </p>
<p>the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. He proposed that the UK and the US should </p>
<p>pursue a strategy based on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the return of weapons </p>
<p>inspectors or face the consequences.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>68. </b> President Bush agreed to consider the idea but there was no decision until </p>
<p>September 2002.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> In the subsequent press conference on 6 April, Mr Blair stated that “doing nothing” </p>
<p>was not an option: the threat of WMD was real and had to be dealt with.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> The lesson </p>
<p>of 11 September was to ensure that “groups” were not allowed to develop a capability </p>
<p>they might use.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair characterised the message that he and President Bush had </p>
<p>delivered to Saddam Hussein as “change the regime attitude on WMD inspections or </p>
<p>face the prospect of changing regime”.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Documents written between April and July 2002 reported that, in the discussion with </p>
<p>President Bush at Crawford, Mr Blair had set out a number of considerations in relation </p>
<p>to the development of policy on Iraq. These were variously described as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN inspectors needed to be given every chance of success.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US should take action within a multilateral framework with international </p>
<p>support, not unilateral action.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>A public information campaign should be mounted to explain the nature </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein’s regime and the threat he posed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any military action would need to be within the framework of international law.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The military strategy would need to ensure Saddam Hussein could be removed </p>
<p>quickly and successfully.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A convincing “blueprint” was needed for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq which </p>
<p>would be acceptable to both Iraq’s population and its neighbours.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US should advance the Middle East Peace Process in order to improve </p>
<p>the chances of gaining broad support in the Middle East for military action </p>
<p>against Iraq; and to pre-empt accusations of double standards.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Action should enhance rather than diminish regional stability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Success would be needed in Afghanistan to demonstrate the benefits </p>
<p>of regime change.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Mr Blair considered that he was seeking to influence US policy by describing the key </p>
<p>elements for a successful strategy to secure international support for any military action </p>
<p>against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Key Ministers and some of their most senior advisers thought these were the </p>
<p>conditions that would need to be met if the UK was to participate in US-led military </p>
<p>action.</p>
<p><b>74.  By July, no progress had been made on the ultimatum strategy and Iraq was </b></p>
<p><b>still refusing to admit weapons inspectors as required by resolution 1284 (1999).</b></p>
<p><b>75.  The UK Government was concerned that the US Administration was </b></p>
<p><b>contemplating military action in circumstances where it would be very difficult </b></p>
<p><b>for the UK to participate in or, conceivably, to support that action.</b></p>
<p><b>76. </b> To provide the basis for a discussion with the US, a Cabinet Office paper of 19 July, </p>
<p>‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’, identified the conditions which would be necessary </p>
<p>before military action would be justified and the UK could participate in such action.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>77. </b> The Cabinet Office paper stated that Mr Blair had said at Crawford:</p>
<p>“… that the UK would support military action to bring about regime change, provided </p>
<p>that certain conditions were met:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>efforts had been made to construct a coalition/shape public opinion,</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Israel-Palestine Crisis was quiescent, and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the options for action to eliminate Iraq’s WMD through the UN weapons </p>
<p>inspectors had been exhausted.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>582</p>
<p><b>78. </b> The Cabinet Office paper also identified the need to address the issue of whether </p>
<p>the benefits of military action would outweigh the risks.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The potential mismatch between the timetable and work programme for UNMOVIC </p>
<p>stipulated in resolution 1284 (1999) and the US plans for military action was recognised </p>
<p>by officials during the preparation of the Cabinet Office paper, ‘Iraq: Conditions for </p>
<p>Military Action’ for Mr Blair’s meeting of 23 July.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The issue was not addressed in the final paper submitted to Ministers on 19 July.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove reported that he had been told that the US had already taken </p>
<p>a decision on action – “the question was only how and when”; and that he had been told </p>
<p>it intended to set the threshold on weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be </p>
<p>able to hold up US policy.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>82. </b> Mr Blair’s meeting with Ministerial colleagues and senior officials on 23 July was </p>
<p>not seen by those involved as having taken decisions.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Further advice and background material were commissioned, including on the </p>
<p>possibility of a UN ultimatum to Iraq and the legal basis for action. The record stated:</p>
<p>“We should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military </p>
<p>action. But we needed a fuller picture of US planning before we could take any firm </p>
<p>decisions. CDS [the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce] should </p>
<p>tell the US military that we were considering a range of options.”</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Blair was advised that there would be “formidable obstacles” to securing a new </p>
<p>UN resolution incorporating an ultimatum without convincing evidence of a greatly </p>
<p>increased threat from Iraq.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> A great deal more work would be needed to clarify what </p>
<p>the UK was seeking and how its objective might best be achieved.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July sought to persuade President Bush to </p>
<p>use the UN to build a coalition for action by seeking a partnership between the UK and </p>
<p>the US and setting out a framework for action.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The Note began:</p>
<p>“I will be with you, whatever. But this is the moment to assess bluntly the difficulties. </p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>583</p>
<p>“The military part of this is hazardous but I will concentrate mainly on the political </p>
<p>context for success.”</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Mr Blair stated that getting rid of Saddam Hussein was:</p>
<p>“… the right thing to do. He is a potential threat. He could be contained. </p>
<p>But containment … is always risky. His departure would free up the region. </p>
<p>And his regime is … brutal and inhumane …”</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that the UN was the simplest way to encapsulate a </p>
<p>“casus belli” in some defining way, with an ultimatum to Iraq once military forces started </p>
<p>to build up in October. That might be backed by a UN resolution.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Mr Blair thought it unlikely that Saddam Hussein intended to allow inspectors to </p>
<p>return. If he did, the JIC had advised that Iraq would obstruct the work of the inspectors. </p>
<p>That could result in a material breach of the obligations imposed by the UN.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> A workable military plan to ensure the collapse of the regime would be required.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The Note reflected Mr Blair’s own views. The proposals had not been discussed </p>
<p>or agreed with his colleagues.</p>
<p><b>Decision to take the UN route</b></p>
<p><b>92. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, told President Bush that it </p>
<p>would be impossible for the UK to take part in any action against Iraq unless it went </p>
<p>through the UN.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 31 July the “central issue of a casus </p>
<p>belli” and the need for further work on the optimal route to achieve that was discussed.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that he wanted to explore whether the UN was the right route to set an </p>
<p>ultimatum or whether it would be an obstacle.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> In late August, the FCO proposed a strategy of coercion, using a UN resolution </p>
<p>to issue an ultimatum to Iraq to admit the weapons inspectors and disarm. The UK </p>
<p>was seeking a commitment from the Security Council to take action in the event that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein refused or subsequently obstructed the inspectors.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Reflecting the level of public debate and concern, Mr Blair decided in early </p>
<p>September that an explanation of why action was needed to deal with Iraq should </p>
<p>be published.</p>
<p><b>96. </b> In his press conference at Sedgefield on 3 September, Mr Blair indicated that time </p>
<p>and patience were running out and that there were difficulties with the existing policy </p>
<p>of containment.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> He also announced the publication of the Iraq dossier, stating that:</p>

<p>584</p>
<p>“… people will see that there is no doubt at all the United Nations resolutions that </p>
<p>Saddam is in breach of are there for a purpose. He [Saddam Hussein] is without any </p>
<p>question, still trying to develop that chemical, biological, potentially nuclear capability </p>
<p>and to allow him to do so without any let or hindrance, just to say, we [sic] can carry </p>
<p>on and do it, I think would be irresponsible.”</p>
<p><b>97.  President Bush decided in the meeting of the National Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>on 7 September to take the issue of Iraq back to the UN.</b></p>
<p><b>98. </b> The UK was a key ally whose support was highly desirable for the US. The US </p>
<p>Administration had been left in no doubt that the UK Government needed the issue </p>
<p>of Iraq to be taken back to the Security Council before it would be able to participate </p>
<p>in military action in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> The objective of the subsequent discussions between President Bush and Mr Blair </p>
<p>at Camp David was, as Mr Blair stated in the press conference before the discussions, </p>
<p>to work out the strategy.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>100. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that he was in no doubt about the need to deal with </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>101. </b> Although at that stage no decision had been taken on which military package might </p>
<p>be offered to the US for planning purposes, Mr Blair also told President Bush that, if it </p>
<p>came to war, the UK would take a significant military role.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> In his speech to the General Assembly on 12 September, President Bush set out </p>
<p>his view of the “grave and gathering danger” posed by Saddam Hussein and challenged </p>
<p>the UN to act to address Iraq’s failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security </p>
<p>Council since 1990.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> He made clear that, if Iraq defied the UN, the world must hold </p>
<p>Iraq to account and the US would “work with the UN Security Council for the necessary </p>
<p>resolutions”. But the US would not stand by and do nothing in the face of the threat.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Statements made by China, France and Russia in the General Assembly debate </p>
<p>after President Bush’s speech highlighted the different positions of the five Permanent </p>
<p>Members of the Security Council, in particular about the role of the Council in deciding </p>
<p>whether military action was justified.</p>
<p><b>104.  The Government dossier on Iraq was published on 24 September.</b></p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b> It was </b></p>
<p><b>designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary (and public) support </b></p>
<p><b>for the Government’s policy that action was urgently required to secure </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s disarmament.</b></p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>585</p>
<p><b>105.  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September and in his answers to </b></p>
<p><b>subsequent questions, Mr Blair presented Iraq’s past, current and potential future </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq’s weapons </b></p>
<p><b>of mass destruction. He said that at some point in the future that threat would </b></p>
<p><b>become a reality.</b></p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Blair wrote his statement to the House of Commons himself and chose the </p>
<p>arguments to make clear his perception of the threat and why he believed that there </p>
<p>was an “overwhelming” case for action to disarm Iraq.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Addressing the question of why Saddam Hussein had decided in mid-September, </p>
<p>but not before, to admit the weapons inspectors, Mr Blair stated that the answer was in </p>
<p>the dossier, and it was because:</p>
<p>“… his chemical, biological and nuclear programme is not an historic left-over from </p>
<p>1998. The inspectors are not needed to clean up the old remains. His weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction programme is active detailed and growing. The policy of </p>
<p>containment is not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme is not </p>
<p>shut down; it is up and running now.”</p>
<p><b>108. </b> Mr Blair posed, and addressed, three questions: “Why Saddam?”; “Why now?”; </p>
<p>and “Why should Britain care?”</p>
<p><b>109. </b> On the question “Why Saddam?”, Mr Blair said that two things about Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein stood out: “He had used these weapons in Iraq” and thousands had died, and </p>
<p>he had used them during the war with Iran “in which 1 million people died”; and the </p>
<p>regime had “no moderate elements to appeal to”.</p>
<p><b>110. </b> On the question “Why now?”, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“I agree I cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, Saddam will </p>
<p>use his weapons. But I can say that if the international community, having made </p>
<p>the call for his disarmament, now, at this moment, at the point of decision, shrugs </p>
<p>its shoulders and walks away, he will draw the conclusion dictators faced with a </p>
<p>weakening will always draw: that the international community will talk but not act, </p>
<p>will use diplomacy but not force. We know, again from our history, that diplomacy </p>
<p>not backed by the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will.”</p>
<p><b>Negotiation of resolution 1441</b></p>
<p><b>111.  There were significant differences between the US and UK positions, and </b></p>
<p><b>between them and China, France and Russia about the substance of the strategy </b></p>
<p><b>to be adopted, including the role of the Security Council in determining whether </b></p>
<p><b>peaceful means had been exhausted and the use of force to secure disarmament </b></p>
<p><b>was justified.</b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>586</p>
<p><b>112.  Those differences resulted in difficult negotiations over more than eight </b></p>
<p><b>weeks before the unanimous adoption of resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>113. </b> When President Bush made his speech on 12 September, the US and UK had </p>
<p>agreed the broad approach, but not the substance of the proposals to be put to the </p>
<p>UN Security Council or the tactics.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Dr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, wrote to Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-</p>
<p>General, on 16 September to inform him that, following the series of talks between Iraq </p>
<p>and the UN in New York and Vienna between March and July 2002 and the latest round </p>
<p>in New York on 14 and 15 September, Iraq had decided “to allow the return of United </p>
<p>Nations inspectors to Iraq without conditions”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>115. </b> The US and UK immediately expressed scepticism. They had agreed that the </p>
<p>provisions of resolution 1284 (1999) were no longer sufficient to secure the disarmament </p>
<p>of Iraq and a strengthened inspections regime would be required.</p>
<p><b>116. </b> A new resolution would be needed both to maintain the pressure on Iraq and to </p>
<p>define a more intrusive inspections regime allowing the inspectors unconditional and </p>
<p>unrestricted access to all Iraqi facilities.</p>
<p><b>117. </b> The UK’s stated objective for the negotiation of resolution 1441 was to give </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “one final chance to comply” with his obligations to disarm. The UK </p>
<p>initially formulated the objective in terms of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a resolution setting out an ultimatum to Iraq to readmit the UN weapons </p>
<p>inspectors and to disarm in accordance with its obligations; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a threat to resort to the use of force to secure disarmament if Iraq failed </p>
<p>to comply.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, informed Mr Blair on 22 October that, </p>
<p>although he would not be able to give a final view until the resolution was adopted, </p>
<p>the draft of the resolution of 19 October would not on its own authorise military action.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Blair decided on 31 October to offer significant forces for ground operations </p>
<p>to the US for planning purposes.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>120. </b> During the negotiations, France and Russia made clear their opposition to the use </p>
<p>of force, without firm evidence of a further material breach and a further decision in the </p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>587</p>
<p><b>121. </b> The UK was successful in changing some aspects of the US position during the </p>
<p>negotiations, in particular ensuring that the Security Council resolution was based on </p>
<p>the disarmament of Iraq rather than wider issues as originally proposed by the US.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions of the </p>
<p>US and France and Russia (described by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN in New York, as “irreconcilable”), resolution 1441 was a </p>
<p>compromise containing drafting “fixes”. That created deliberate ambiguities on a number </p>
<p>of key issues including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the level of non-compliance with resolution 1441 which would constitute </p>
<p>a material breach;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>whether there would be a second resolution explicitly authorising the use </p>

<p><b>123. </b> As the Explanations of Vote demonstrated, there were significant differences </p>
<p>between the positions of the members of the Security Council about the circumstances </p>
<p>and timing of recourse to military action. There were also differences about whether </p>
<p>Member States should be entitled to report Iraqi non-compliance to the Council.</p>
<p><b>124. </b> Mr Blair, Mr Straw and other senior UK participants in the negotiation of resolution </p>
<p>1441 envisaged that, in the event of a material breach of Iraq’s obligations, a second </p>
<p>resolution determining that a breach existed and authorising the use of force was likely </p>
<p>to be tabled in the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>125. </b> Iraq announced on 13 November that it would comply with resolution 1441.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Iraq also re-stated its position that it had neither produced nor was in possession </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction since the inspectors left in December 1998. It explicitly </p>
<p>challenged the UK statement on 8 November that Iraq had decided to keep possession </p>
<p>of its WMD.</p>
<p><b>The prospect of military action</b></p>
<p><b>127. </b> Following Iraq’s submission of the declaration on its chemical, biological, nuclear </p>
<p>and ballistic missile programmes to the UN on 7 December, and before the inspectors </p>
<p>had properly begun their task, the US concluded that Saddam Hussein was not going </p>
<p>to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 to comply with his obligations.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Mr Blair was advised on 11 December that there was impatience in the US </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>588</p>
<p><b>129. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush on 16 December that the Iraqi declaration was </p>
<p>“patently false”.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> He was “cautiously optimistic” that the inspectors would find proof.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> In a statement issued on 18 December, Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein had </p>
<p>decided to continue the pretence that Iraq had no WMD programme. If he persisted </p>
<p>“in this obvious falsehood” it would become clear that he had “rejected the pathway </p>
<p>to peace”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>131. </b> The JIC’s initial Assessment of the Iraqi declaration on 18 December stated </p>
<p>that there had been “No serious attempt” to answer any of the unresolved questions </p>
<p>highlighted by the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) or to refute any of the points </p>
<p>made in the UK dossier on Iraq’s WMD programme.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>132. </b> President Bush is reported to have told a meeting of the US National Security </p>
<p>Council on 18 December 2002, at which the US response to Iraq’s declaration was </p>
<p>discussed, that the point of the 7 December declaration was to test whether Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would accept the “final opportunity” for peace offered by the Security Council.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had summed up the discussion by stating:</p>
<p>“We’ve got what we need now, to show America that Saddam won’t disarm himself.”</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Mr Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, stated on 19 December that Iraq was </p>
<p>“well on its way to losing its last chance”, and that there was a “practical limit” to how </p>
<p>long the inspectors could be given to complete their work.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>134. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell on 30 December that the US and UK should </p>
<p>develop a clear “plan B” postponing military action on the basis that inspections plus </p>
<p>the threat of force were containing Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>135. </b> In early 2003, Mr Straw still thought a peaceful solution was more likely than </p>
<p>military action. Mr Straw advised Mr Blair on 3 January that he had concluded that, in </p>
<p>the potential absence of a “smoking gun”, there was a need to consider a “Plan B”.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>UK should emphasise to the US that the preferred strategy was peaceful disarmament.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Mr Blair took a different view. By the time he returned to the office on 4 January </p>
<p>2003, he had concluded that the “likelihood was war” and, if conflict could not be </p>
<p>avoided, the right thing to do was fully to support the US.</p>

<p><b>137. </b> The UK objectives were published in a Written Ministerial Statement by Mr Straw </p>
<p>on 7 January.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> The “prime objective” was:</p>
<p>“… to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated </p>
<p>programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles … as set </p>
<p>out in UNSCRs [UN Security Council resolutions]. This would reduce Iraq’s ability </p>
<p>to threaten its neighbours and the region, and prevent Iraq using WMD against its </p>
<p>own people. UNSCRs also require Iraq to renounce terrorism, and return captured </p>
<p>Kuwaitis and property taken from Kuwait.”</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Lord Goldsmith gave Mr Blair his draft advice on 14 January that resolution 1441 </p>
<p>would not by itself authorise the use of military force.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Mr Blair agreed on 17 January to deploy a UK division with three combat brigades </p>
<p>for possible operations in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><b>140. </b> There was no collective discussion of the decision by senior Ministers.</p>
<p><b>141.  In January 2003, there was a clear divergence between the UK and US </b></p>
<p><b>Government positions over the timetable for military action, and the UK became </b></p>
<p><b>increasingly concerned that US impatience with the inspections process would </b></p>
<p><b>lead to a decision to take unilateral military action in the absence of support for </b></p>
<p><b>such action in the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>142. </b> On 23 January, Mr Blair was advised that the US military would be ready for action </p>
<p>in mid-February.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>143. </b> In a Note to President Bush on 24 January, Mr Blair wrote that the arguments </p>
<p>for proceeding with a second Security Council resolution, “or at the very least a </p>
<p>clear statement” from Dr Blix which allowed the US and UK to argue that a failure </p>
<p>to pass a second resolution was in breach of the spirit of 1441, remained in his view, </p>
<p>overwhelming; and that inspectors should be given until the end of March or early April </p>
<p>to carry out their task.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Mr Blair suggested that, in the absence of a “smoking gun”, Dr Blix would be able </p>
<p>to harden up his findings on the basis of a pattern of non-co-operation from Iraq and that </p>
<p>that would be sufficient for support for military action in the Security Council.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>590</p>
<p><b>145. </b> The US and UK should seek to persuade others, including Dr Blix, that that was </p>
<p>the “true view” of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Mr Blair used an interview on <i>Breakfast with Frost</i> on 26 January to set out the </p>
<p>position that the inspections should be given sufficient time to determine whether or </p>
<p>not Saddam Hussein was co-operating fully.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> If he was not, that would be a sufficient </p>
<p>reason for military action. A find of WMD was not required.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Mr Blair’s proposed approach to his meeting with President Bush was discussed </p>
<p>in a meeting of Ministers before Cabinet on 30 January and then discussed in general </p>
<p>terms in Cabinet itself.</p>
<p><b>148. </b> In a Note prepared before his meeting with President Bush on 31 January, Mr Blair </p>
<p>proposed seeking a UN resolution on 5 March followed by an attempt to “mobilise Arab </p>
<p>opinion to try to force Saddam out” before military action on 15 March.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>149. </b> When Mr Blair met President Bush on 31 January, it was clear that the window of </p>
<p>opportunity before the US took military action would be very short. The military campaign </p>
<p>could begin “around 10 March”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>150. </b> President Bush agreed to seek a second resolution to help Mr Blair, but there were </p>
<p>major reservations within the US Administration about the wisdom of that approach.</p>
<p><b>151. </b> Mr Blair confirmed that he was “solidly with the President and ready to do whatever </p>
<p>it took to disarm Saddam” Hussein.</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Reporting on his visit to Washington, Mr Blair told Parliament on 3 February 2003 </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein was not co-operating as required by resolution 1441 and, if that </p>
<p>continued, a second resolution should be passed to confirm such a material breach.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Blair continued to set the need for action against Iraq in the context of the need </p>
<p>to be seen to enforce the will of the UN and to deter future threats.</p>
<p><b>The gap between the Permanent Members of the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>widens</b></p>
<p><b>154.  In their reports to the Security Council on 14 February:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Dr Blix reported that UNMOVIC had not found any weapons of mass </b></p>
<p><b>destruction and the items that were not accounted for might not exist, </b></p>

<p><b>Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic </b></p>
<p><b>Energy Agency (IAEA), reported that the IAEA had found no evidence </b></p>
<p><b>of ongoing prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related activities in Iraq although </b></p>
<p><b>a number of issues were still under investigation.</b></p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>155. </b> In the subsequent debate, members of the Security Council voiced widely </p>
<p>divergent views.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Mr Annan concluded that there were real differences on strategy and timing in </p>
<p>the Security Council. Iraq’s non-co-operation was insufficient to bring members to agree </p>
<p>that war was justified; they would only move if they came to their own judgement that </p>
<p>inspections were pointless.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>157. </b> On 19 February, Mr Blair sent President Bush a six-page Note. He proposed </p>
<p>focusing on the absence of full co-operation and a “simple” resolution stating that Iraq </p>
<p>had failed to take the final opportunity, with a side statement defining tough tests of </p>
<p>co-operation and a vote on 14 March to provide a deadline for action.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>158. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair agreed to introduce a draft resolution at the UN the </p>
<p>following week but its terms were subject to further discussion.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>159. </b> On 20 February, Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he wanted to offer the US an alternative </p>
<p>strategy which included a deadline and tests for compliance.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> He did not think Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would co-operate but he would try to get Dr Blix as much time as possible. Iraq </p>
<p>could have signalled a change of heart in the December declaration. The Americans did </p>
<p>not think that Saddam was going to co-operate: “Nor did he. But we needed to keep the </p>
<p>international community together.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Dr Blix stated that full co-operation was a nebulous concept; and a deadline of </p>
<p>15 April would be too early. Dr Blix commented that “perhaps there was not much WMD </p>
<p>in Iraq after all”. Mr Blair responded that “even German and French intelligence were </p>
<p>sure that there was WMD in Iraq”. Dr Blix said they seemed “unsure” about “mobile BW </p>
<p>production facilities”: “It would be paradoxical and absurd if 250,000 men were to invade </p>
<p>Iraq and find very little.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Mr Blair responded that “our intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted </p>
<p>his WMD programme”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>592</p>
<p><b>162. </b> On 24 February, the UK, US and Spain tabled a draft resolution stating that Iraq </p>
<p>had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 and that the Security </p>
<p>Council had decided to remain seized of the matter.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> The draft failed to attract support.</p>
<p><b>163. </b> France, Germany and Russia responded by tabling a memorandum, building on </p>
<p>their tripartite declaration of 10 February, stating that “full and effective disarmament” </p>
<p>remained “the imperative objective of the international community”.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> That “should be </p>
<p>achieved peacefully through the inspection regime”. The “conditions for using force” </p>
<p>had “not been fulfilled”. The Security Council “must step up its efforts to give a real </p>
<p>chance to the peaceful settlement of the crisis”.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> On 25 February, Mr Blair told the House of Commons that the intelligence was </p>
<p>“clear” that Saddam Hussein continued “to believe that his weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>programme is essential both for internal repression and for external aggression”.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> It was </p>
<p>also “essential to his regional power”. “Prior to the inspectors coming back in”, Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein “was engaged in a systematic exercise in concealment of those weapons”. </p>
<p>The inspectors had reported some co-operation on process, but had “denied progress </p>
<p>on substance”.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> The House of Commons was asked on 26 February to reaffirm its endorsement of </p>
<p>resolution 1441, support the Government’s continuing efforts to disarm Iraq, and to call </p>
<p>upon Iraq to recognise that this was its final opportunity to comply with its obligations.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>166. </b> The Government motion was approved by 434 votes to 124; 199 MPs voted for </p>
<p>an amendment which invited the House to “find the case for military action against Iraq </p>
<p>as yet unproven”.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>167. </b> In a speech on 26 February, President Bush stated that the safety of the American </p>
<p>people depended on ending the direct and growing threat from Iraq.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>168. </b> President Bush also set out his hopes for the future of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Reporting discussions in New York on 26 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote </p>
<p>that there was “a general antipathy to having now to take decisions on this issue, and </p>

<p><b>170. </b> Lord Goldsmith told No.10 officials on 27 February that the safest legal course for </p>
<p>future military action would be to secure a further Security Council resolution.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> He had, </p>
<p>however, reached the view that a “reasonable case” could be made that resolution 1441 </p>
<p>was capable of reviving the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 (1990) without a </p>
<p>further resolution, if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed </p>
<p>to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Lord Goldsmith advised that, to avoid undermining the case for reliance on </p>
<p>resolution 1441, it would be important to avoid giving any impression that the UK </p>
<p>believed a second resolution was legally required.</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Informal consultations in the Security Council on 27 February showed there was </p>

<p>resolved by peaceful means and in the framework of international legitimacy.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Following his visit to Mexico, Sir David Manning concluded that Mexican support </p>
<p>for a second resolution was “not impossible, but would not be easy and would almost </p>
<p>certainly require some movement”.</p>

<p><b>175. </b> During Sir David’s visit to Chile, President Ricardo Lagos repeated his concerns, </p>
<p>including the difficulty of securing nine votes or winning the presentational battle </p>
<p>without further clarification of Iraq’s non-compliance. He also suggested identifying </p>

<p><b>176. </b> Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that, during February, “despite his best endeavours”, </p>
<p>divisions in the Security Council had grown not reduced; and that the “dynamics of </p>
<p>disagreement” were producing new alliances.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> France, Germany and Russia were </p>
<p>moving to create an alternative pole of power and influence.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>594</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Mr Blair concluded that for moral and strategic reasons the UK should be with the </p>
<p>US and that:</p>
<p>“… [W]e should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution. First to make </p>
<p>the moral case for removing Saddam … Second, to try one more time to reunite </p>
<p>the international community behind a clear base for action in the event of a </p>
<p>continuing breach.”</p>
<p><b>179. </b> On 3 March, Mr Blair proposed an approach focused on setting a deadline of </p>
<p>17 March for Iraq to disclose evidence relating to the destruction of prohibited items </p>
<p>and permit interviews; and an amnesty if Saddam Hussein left Iraq by 21 March.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that the level of support in the UK for military action </p>
<p>without a second resolution was palpably “very low”. In that circumstance, even if a </p>
<p>majority in the Security Council had voted for the resolution with only France exercising </p>
<p>its veto, he was “increasingly pessimistic” about support within the Labour Party for </p>
<p>military action.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> The debate in the UK was:</p>
<p>“… significantly defined by the tone of the debate in Washington and particularly </p>

<p>the US would go to war whatever and was not bothered about a second resolution </p>
<p>one way or another.”</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Following a discussion with Mr Blair, Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… was concerned that, having shifted world (and British) public opinion over the </p>
<p>months, it had now been seriously set back in recent days. We were not in the right </p>
<p>position. The Prime Minister was considering a number of ideas which he might well </p>
<p>put to the President.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Straw recorded that Secretary Powell had advised that, if Mr Blair wanted </p>
<p>to make proposals, he should do so quickly. The US was not enthusiastic about the </p>
<p>inclusion of an immunity clause for Saddam Hussein in the resolution.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Mr Straw reported that Secretary Powell had told President Bush that he judged </p>
<p>a vetoed resolution would no longer be possible for the UK. Mr Straw said that without </p>
<p>a second resolution approval for military action could be “beyond reach”.</p>
<p><b>184. </b> Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) on 4 March that it was “a matter </p>
<p>of fact” that Iraq had been in material breach “for some weeks” and resolution 1441 </p>
<p>provided sufficient legal authority to justify military action against Iraq if it was “in further </p>
<p>material breach”.</p>

<p><b>185. </b> Mr Straw also stated that a majority of members of the Security Council had been </p>
<p>opposed to the suggestion that resolution 1441 should state explicitly that military action </p>
<p>could be taken only if there were a second resolution.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> Mr Blair was informed on the evening of 4 March that US military planners were </p>
<p>looking at 12 March as the possible start date for the military campaign; and that </p>
<p>Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, was concerned about the apparent disconnect </p>
<p>with activity in the UN.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Baroness Amos, Minister of State, Department for International Development </p>
<p>(DfID), advised on 4 March that Angola, Cameroon and Guinea were not yet ready </p>
<p>to commit to a “yes vote” and had emphasised the need for P5 unity.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Sir Christopher Hum, British Ambassador to China, advised on 4 March that, </p>
<p>if the resolution was put to a vote that day, China would abstain.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to France, advised on 4 March that France’s </p>
<p>main aim was to “avoid being put on the spot” by influencing the undecided, preventing </p>
<p>the US and UK mustering nine votes, and keeping alongside the Russians and Chinese; </p>
<p>and that there was “nothing that we can now do to dissuade them from this course”.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir John also advised that “nothing the French say at this stage, even privately, should </p>
<p>be taken at face value”.</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, told Mr Straw on 4 March that Russia </p>
<p>had failed in an attempt to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave and it would veto a </p>
<p>resolution based on the draft circulated on 24 February.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>191. </b> France, Germany and Russia stated on 5 March that they would not let a resolution </p>
<p>pass that authorised the use of force.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> Russia and France, “as Permanent Members of </p>
<p>the Security Council, will assume all their responsibilities on this point”.</p>
<p><b>192. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported overnight on 5/6 March that “barring </p>
<p>a highly improbable volte face by Saddam”, the US was now firmly on track for military </p>
<p>action and would deal firmly with any efforts in the UN to slow down the timetable.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>193. </b> The Embassy reported that the only event which might significantly affect the US </p>
<p>timetable would be problems for the UK. That had been described as “huge – like trying </p>

<p>at the UN”. The US fully understood the importance of the second resolution for the UK.</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US would not countenance the use of </p>
<p>benchmarks. That risked delaying the military timetable.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 March that the argument boiled down to the question of </p>
<p>whether Saddam Hussein would ever voluntarily co-operate with the UN to disarm Iraq.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr Blair concluded that it was for the Security Council to determine whether Iraq </p>
<p>was co-operating fully.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> In his discussions with President Lagos on 6 March, Mr Blair stated that the US </p>
<p>would go ahead without the UN if asked to delay military action until April or May.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>198.  In his report to the Security Council on 7 March, Dr Blix stated that there had </b></p>
<p><b>been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq since the end of January, but they </b></p>
<p><b>could not be said to constitute immediate co-operation.</b></p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b> Nor did they necessarily </b></p>
<p><b>cover all areas of relevance; but they were nevertheless welcome. UNMOVIC was </b></p>
<p><b>drawing up a work programme of key disarmament tasks, which would be ready </b></p>
<p><b>later that month, for approval by the Security Council. It would take “months” </b></p>
<p><b>to complete the programme.</b></p>
<p><b>199.  Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed </b></p>
<p><b>nuclear activities since the inspectors left in December 1998 and the recently </b></p>
<p><b>increased level of Iraqi co-operation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council with an assessment of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in the near future.</b></p>
<p><b>200. </b> There was unanimity in calls for Iraq to increase its co-operation. But there was a </p>
<p>clear division between the US, UK, Spain and Bulgaria who spoke in favour of a further </p>
<p>resolution and France, Germany, Russia and China and most other Member States </p>
<p>who spoke in favour of continuing to pursuing disarmament through strengthened </p>
<p>inspections.</p>
<p><b>201. </b> The UK, US and Spain circulated a revised draft resolution deciding that Iraq </p>
<p>would have failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 (2002) unless </p>
<p>the Council concluded, on or before 17 March 2003, that Iraq had demonstrated full, </p>
<p>unconditional, immediate and active co-operation in accordance with its disarmament </p>
<p>obligations and was yielding possession of all weapons and proscribed material to </p>

<p><b>202. </b> President Putin told Mr Blair on 7 March that Russia would oppose military action.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Mr Straw told Mr Annan that military considerations could not be allowed “to dictate </p>
<p>policy”, but the military build-up “could not be maintained for ever”, and:</p>
<p>“… the more he had looked into the Iraq dossier [issue] the more convinced </p>
<p>he had become of the need for action. Reading the clusters document [a report </p>
<p>of outstanding issues produced by UNMOVIC on 7 March] made his hair stand </p>
<p>on end.”</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Mr Straw set out the UK thinking on a deadline, stating that this was “Iraq’s last </p>
<p>chance”, but the objective was disarmament and, if Saddam Hussein did what was </p>
<p>demanded, “he could stay”. In those circumstances, a “permanent and toughened </p>
<p>inspections regime” would be needed, possibly “picking up some earlier ideas for </p>
<p>an all-Iraq NFZ”.</p>

<p><b>The end of the UN route</b></p>
<p><b>206. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush at 6pm on 7 March he emphasised the </p>
<p>importance of securing nine positive votes</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> in the Security Council for Parliamentary </p>
<p>approval for UK military action.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>207. </b> Mr Blair argued that while the 17 March deadline in the draft resolution was not </p>
<p>sufficient for Iraq to disarm fully, it was sufficient to make a judgement on whether </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had had a change of heart. If Iraq started to co-operate, the inspectors </p>
<p>could have as much time as they liked.</p>
<p><b>208.  In a last attempt to move opinion and secure the support of nine members </b></p>
<p><b>of the Security Council, Mr Blair decided on 8 March to propose a short extension </b></p>
<p><b>of the timetable beyond 17 March and to revive the idea of producing a “side </b></p>
<p><b>statement” setting out a series of tests which would provide the basis for a </b></p>
<p><b>judgement on Saddam Hussein’s intentions.</b></p>
<p><b>209. </b> The initiative was pursued through intensive diplomatic activity to lobby for support </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>598</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It was worth having one last-ditch chance to see if you could bring people back </p>
<p>together on the same page … [W]hat President Bush had to do was agree to </p>
<p>table a fresh resolution. What the French had to agree was you couldn't have </p>
<p>another resolution and another breach and no action. So my idea was define the </p>
<p>circumstances of breach – that was the tests that we applied with Hans Blix – get </p>
<p>the Americans to agree to the resolution, get the French to agree that you couldn't </p>
<p>just go back to the same words of 1441 again, you had to take it a stage further.”</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><b>211.  In a discussion on 9 March, Mr Blair told President Bush that he needed </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution to secure Parliamentary support for UK involvement in </b></p>
<p><b>military action.</b></p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b> He sought President Bush’s support for setting out tests </b></p>
<p><b>in a side statement, including that the vote in the Security Council might </b></p>
<p><b>have to be delayed “by a couple of days”.</b></p>
<p><b>212.  President Bush was unwilling to countenance delay. He was reported to have </b></p>
<p><b>told Mr Blair that, if the second resolution failed, he would find another way to </b></p>
<p><b>involve the UK.</b></p>
<p><b>213.  Mr Blair told President Bush the UK would be with the US in taking action </b></p>
<p><b>if he (Mr Blair) possibly could be.</b></p>
<p><b>214. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix was prepared to work with the UK </p>
<p>on identifying tests but had reminded him that UNMOVIC still lacked clear evidence </p>
<p>that Iraq possessed any WMD.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Mr Blair spoke twice to President Lagos on 10 March in an attempt to find a path </p>
<p>that President Lagos and President Vicente Fox of Mexico could support.</p>
<p><b>216. </b> In the second conversation, Mr Blair said that he thought it “would be possible to </p>
<p>find different wording” on the ultimatum to Iraq. Timing “would be difficult, but he would </p>
<p>try to get some flexibility” if the first two issues “fell into place”.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>217. </b> Mr Straw reported that Secretary Powell thought that there were seven solid votes, </p>
<p>and uncertainty about Mexico, Chile and Pakistan.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> If there were fewer than nine, the </p>
<p>second resolution should not be put to the vote.</p>
<p><b>218. </b> Mr Straw replied that “he was increasingly coming to the view that we should not </p>
<p>push the matter to a vote if we were going to be vetoed”; but that had not yet been </p>
<p>agreed by Mr Blair.</p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>599</p>
<p><b>219.  By 10 March, President Bush’s position was hardening and he was very </b></p>
<p><b>reluctant to delay military action.</b></p>
<p><b>220. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, they discussed the “seven solid votes” </p>
<p>for the resolution.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, </p>
<p>wrote that Mr Blair had done most of the talking.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> President Bush thought President </p>
<p>Jacques Chirac of France was “trying to get us to the stage where we would not put </p>
<p>[the resolution] to a vote because we would be so worried about losing”.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr Blair had argued that if Chile and Mexico could be shifted, that would “change </p>
<p>the weather”. If France and Russia then vetoed the resolution but the “numbers were </p>
<p>right on the UN”, Mr Blair thought that he would “have a fighting chance of getting it </p>
<p>through the Commons”. Subsequently, Mr Blair suggested that a change in Chile and </p>
<p>Mexico’s position might be used to influence President Putin.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> President Bush was “worried about rolling in more time” but Mr Blair had “held his </p>
<p>ground”, arguing that Chile and Mexico would “need to be able to point to something that </p>
<p>they won last minute that explains why they finally supported us”. President Bush “said </p>
<p>‘Let me be frank. The second resolution is for the benefit of Great Britain. We would </p>
<p>want it so we can go ahead together.’” President Bush’s position was that the US and </p>
<p>UK “must not retreat from 1441 and we cannot keep giving them more time”; it was “time </p>
<p>to do this” and there should be “no more deals”.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Sir David Manning sent the UK proposals for a revised deadline, and a side </p>
<p>statement identifying six tests on which Saddam Hussein’s intentions would be </p>
<p>judged, to Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, and </p>
<p>to President Lagos.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that President Bush and his military were concerned </p>
<p>about delay.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>“It [the proposal for tests/more time] was indeed a hard sell to George. His system </p>
<p>was completely against it. His military were, not unreasonably, fearing that delay </p>
<p>gave the enemy time – and time could mean a tougher struggle and more lives lost. </p>
<p>This was also troubling my military. We had all sorts of contingency plans in place … </p>
<p>There was both UK and US intelligence warning us of the risk.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless I thought it was worth a try …”</p>

<p><b>226. </b> Mr Blair also wrote:</p>
<p>“Chile and Mexico were prepared to go along, but only up to a point. Ricardo made </p>
<p>it clear that if there was heavy opposition from France, it would be tough for them to </p>
<p>participate in what would then be a token vote, incapable of being passed because </p>
<p>of a veto – and what’s more, a veto not by Russia, but by France.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the French position had, if anything, got harder not softer. They </p>
<p>were starting to say they would not support military action in any circumstances, </p>
<p>irrespective of what the inspectors found …”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> In a press conference on 10 March, Mr Annan reiterated the Security Council’s </p>
<p>determination to disarm Iraq, but said that every avenue for a peaceful resolution of </p>
<p>the crisis had to be exhausted before force should be used.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>228. </b> Mr Annan also warned that, if the Security Council failed to agree on a common </p>
<p>position and action was taken without the authority of the Council, the legitimacy and </p>
<p>support for any such action would be seriously impaired.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> In an interview on 10 March, President Chirac stated that it was for the inspectors </p>
<p>to advise whether they could complete their task.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> If they reported that they were not </p>
<p>in a position to guarantee Iraq’s disarmament, it would be:</p>
<p>“… for the Security Council alone to decide the right thing to do. But in that case … </p>
<p>regrettably, the war would become inevitable. It isn’t today.”</p>
<p><b>230. </b> President Chirac stated that he did not consider that the draft resolution tabled by </p>
<p>the US, UK and Spain would attract support from nine members of the Security Council. </p>
<p>In that case, there would be no majority for action, “So there won’t be a veto problem.”</p>
<p><b>231. </b> But if there were a majority “in favour of the new resolution”, France would </p>
<p>“vote ‘no’”.</p>
<p><b>232. </b> In response to a question asking, “And, this evening, this is your position in </p>
<p>principle?”, President Chirac responded:</p>
<p>“My position is that, regardless of the circumstances, France will vote ‘no’ because </p>
<p>she considers this evening that there are no grounds for waging war in order to </p>
<p>achieve the goal we have set ourselves, that is to disarm Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>233.  By 11 March, it was clear that, in the time available before the US was </b></p>
<p><b>going to take military action, it would be difficult to secure nine votes in the </b></p>

<p>601</p>
<p><b>Security Council for a resolution determining that Iraq had failed to take the </b></p>
<p><b>final opportunity offered by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 11 March setting out his firm conclusion that:</p>
<p>“If we cannot gain nine votes and be sure of no veto, we should not push our second </p>
<p>resolution to a vote. The political and diplomatic consequences for the UK would </p>
<p>be significantly worse to have our … resolution defeated … than if we camp </p>
<p>on 1441 …”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>235. </b> Mr Straw set out his reasoning in some detail, including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although in earlier discussion he had “warmed to the idea” that it was worth </p>
<p>pushing the issue to a vote “if we had nine votes and faced only a French veto”, </p>
<p>the more he “thought about this, the worse an idea it becomes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A veto by France only was “in practice less likely than two or even three vetoes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “best, least risky way to gain a moral majority” was “by the ‘Kosovo route’ – </p>
<p>essentially what I am recommending. The key to our moral legitimacy then was </p>
<p>the matter never went to a vote – but everyone knew the reason for this was that </p>
<p>Russia would have vetoed.”</p>
<p><b>236. </b> Mr Straw suggested that the UK should adopt a strategy based on the argument </p>
<p>that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441, and that the </p>
<p>last three meetings of the Security Council met the requirement for Security Council </p>
<p>consideration of reports of non-compliance.</p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Straw also identified the need for a “Plan B” for the UK not to participate </p>
<p>in military action in the event that the Government failed to secure a majority in the </p>
<p>Parliamentary Labour Party for military action.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“We will obviously need to discuss all this, but I thought it best to put it in your mind </p>
<p>as event[s] could move fast. And what I propose is a great deal better than the </p>
<p>alternatives. When Bush graciously accepted your offer to be with him all the way, </p>
<p>he wanted you alive not dead!”</p>
<p><b>239. </b> There was no reference in the minute to President Chirac’s remarks the previous </p>
<p>evening.</p>
<p><b>240. </b> When Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the position late on 11 March, it was </p>
<p>clear that President Bush was determined not to postpone the start of military action.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>602</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Reporting discussions in New York on 11 March on the draft resolution and details </p>
<p>of a possible “side statement”, Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the draft resolution </p>
<p>tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March had “no chance … of adoption”.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>242. </b> When he discussed the options with Mr Straw early on 12 March, Mr Blair decided </p>
<p>that the UK would continue to support the US.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>243. </b> During Prime Minister’s Questions on 12 March, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“I hope that even now those countries that are saying they would use their veto no </p>
<p>matter what the circumstances will reconsider and realise that by doing so they put </p>
<p>at risk not just the disarmament of Saddam, but the unity of the United Nations.”</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>244. </b> In a telephone call with President Bush on 12 March, Mr Blair proposed that the </p>
<p>US and UK should continue to seek a compromise in the UN, while confirming that he </p>
<p>knew it would not happen. He would say publicly that the French had prevented them </p>
<p>from securing a resolution, so there would not be one.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Mr Blair wanted to avoid a gap between the end of the negotiating process and </p>
<p>the Parliamentary vote in which France or another member of the Security Council might </p>
<p>table a resolution that attracted the support of a majority of the Council. That could have </p>
<p>undermined the UK (and US) position on its legal basis for action.</p>
<p><b>246. </b> The FCO assessed on 12 March that the votes of the three African states were </p>
<p>reasonably secure but Pakistan’s vote was not so certain. It was hoped that the six tests </p>
<p>plus a short extension of the 17 March deadline might deliver Mexico and Chile.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>247. </b> The UK circulated its draft side statement setting out the six tests to a meeting </p>
<p>of Security Council members in New York on the evening of 12 March.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>248. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Council members that the UK “non-paper” responded </p>
<p>to an approach from the “undecided six”</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> looking for a way forward, setting out six </p>
<p>tasks to be achieved in a 10-day timeline.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy reported that France, Germany </p>
<p>and Russia all said that the draft resolution without operative paragraph 3 would still </p>
<p>authorise force. The UK had not achieved “any kind of breakthrough” and there were </p>
<p>“serious questions about the available time”, which the US would “not help us to satisfy”.</p>

<p>603</p>
<p><b>249.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 13 March that work continued in the UN to obtain </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution and, following the French decision to veto, the outcome </b></p>
<p><b>remained open.</b></p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>250.  Mr Straw described President Chirac’s position as “irresponsible”.</b></p>
<p><b>251.  Mr Straw told Cabinet that there was “good progress” in gaining support </b></p>
<p><b>in the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>252. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the French position “looked to be based on a calculation </p>
<p>of strategic benefit”. It was “in contradiction of the Security Council’s earlier view that </p>
<p>military action would follow if Iraq did not fully and unconditionally co-operate with the </p>
<p>inspectors”. The UK would “continue to show flexibility” in its efforts to achieve a second </p>
<p>resolution and, “if France could be shown to be intransigent, the mood of the Security </p>
<p>Council could change towards support for the British draft”.</p>
<p><b>253. </b> Mr Blair agreed the military plan later on 13 March.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>254.  On 13 March, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed withdrawing the </b></p>
<p><b>resolution on 17 March followed by a US ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave </b></p>
<p><b>within 48 hours. There would be no US military action until after the vote in the </b></p>
<p><b>House of Commons on 18 March.</b></p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>255.  Mr Blair continued to press President Bush to publish the Road Map on the </b></p>
<p><b>Middle East Peace Process because of its impact on domestic opinion in the UK </b></p>
<p><b>as well as its strategic impact.</b></p>
<p><b>256. </b> Reporting developments in New York on 13 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock warned </p>
<p>that the UK tests had attracted no support, and that the US might be ready to call a halt </p>
<p>to the UN process on 15 March.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> The main objections had included the “perceived </p>
<p>authorisation of force in the draft resolution” and a desire to wait for UNMOVIC’s own list </p>
<p>of key tasks which would be issued early the following week.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> President Chirac told Mr Blair on 14 March that France was “content to proceed </p>
<p>‘in the logic of UNSCR 1441’; but it could not accept an ultimatum or any ‘automaticity’ </p>
<p>of recourse to force”.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> He proposed looking at a new resolution in line with resolution </p>
<p>1441, “provided that it excluded these options”. President Chirac “suggested that the </p>
<p>UNMOVIC work programme might provide a way forward. France was prepared to look </p>
<p>at reducing the 120 day timeframe it envisaged.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>604</p>
<p><b>258. </b> In response to a question from President Chirac about whether it would be the </p>
<p>inspectors or the Security Council who decided whether Saddam had co-operated, </p>
<p>Mr Blair “insisted that it must be the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>259. </b> President Chirac agreed, “although the Security Council should make its </p>
<p>judgement on the basis of the inspectors’ report”. He “wondered whether it would be </p>
<p>worth” Mr Straw and Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister, “discussing </p>
<p>the situation to see if we could find some flexibility”; or was it “too late”?</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Mr Blair said, “every avenue must be explored”.</p>
<p><b>261. </b> In the subsequent conversation with President Bush about the French position and </p>
<p>what to say when the resolution was pulled, Mr Blair proposed that they would need to </p>
<p>show that France would not authorise the use of force in any circumstances.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>262. </b> President Lagos initially informed Mr Blair on 14 March that the UK proposals did </p>
<p>not have Chile’s support and that he was working on other ideas.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> He subsequently </p>
<p>informed Mr Blair that he would not pursue his proposals unless Mr Blair or President </p>
<p>Bush asked him to.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d'Affaires, British Embassy Washington, reported that </p>
<p>President Bush was determined to remove Saddam Hussein and to stick to the US </p>
<p>timetable for action. The UK’s “steadfastness” had been “invaluable” in bringing in other </p>
<p>countries in support of action.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>264. </b> In a declaration on 15 March, France, with Germany and Russia, attempted </p>
<p>to secure support in the Security Council for continued inspections.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>265. </b> At the Azores Summit on 16 March, President Bush, Mr Blair and Prime Minister </p>
<p>José María Aznar of Spain agreed that, unless there was a fundamental change in the </p>
<p>next 24 hours, the UN process would end.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>266. </b> In public, the focus was on a “last chance for peace”. The joint communiqué </p>
<p>contained a final appeal to Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and to </p>
<p>the Security Council to back a second resolution containing an ultimatum.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“So when I look back … I know there was never any way Britain was not going to </p>
<p>be with the US at that moment, once we went down the UN route and Saddam was </p>
<p>in breach. Of course such a statement is always subject to <i>in extremis</i> correction. </p>

<p>A crazy act of aggression? No, we would not have supported that. But given </p>
<p>the history, you couldn’t call Saddam a crazy target.</p>
<p>“Personally I have little doubt that at some point we would have to have dealt </p>
<p>with him …”</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>268. </b> At “about 3.15pm UK time” on 17 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock announced that </p>
<p>the resolution would not be put to a vote, stating that the co-sponsors reserved the right </p>
<p>to take their own steps to secure the disarmament of Iraq.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>269. </b> The subsequent discussion in the Council suggested that only the UK, the US, </p>
<p>and Spain took the view that all options other than the use of military force had been </p>
<p>exhausted.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>270.  A specially convened Cabinet at 1600 on 17 March 2003 endorsed the </b></p>
<p><b>decision that the diplomatic process was now at an end and Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>should be given an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and that the House of Commons </b></p>
<p><b>would be asked to endorse the use of military action against Iraq to enforce </b></p>
<p><b>compliance, if necessary.</b></p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>271. </b> In his statement to the House of Commons that evening, Mr Straw said that the </p>
<p>Government had reluctantly concluded that France’s actions had put a consensus in </p>
<p>the Security Council on a further resolution “beyond reach”.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>272. </b> As a result of Saddam Hussein’s persistent refusal to meet the UN’s demands, </p>
<p>the Cabinet had decided to ask the House of Commons to support the UK’s participation </p>
<p>in military action, should that be necessary to achieve the disarmament of Iraq “and </p>
<p>thereby the maintenance of the authority of the United Nations”.</p>
<p><b>273. </b> Mr Straw stated that Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer “set out the legal basis for </p>
<p>the use of force”.</p>
<p><b>274. </b> Mr Straw drew attention to the significance of the fact that no one “in discussions </p>
<p>in the Security Council and outside” had claimed that Iraq was in full compliance with </p>
<p>its obligations.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> In a statement later that evening, Mr Robin Cook, the Leader of the House of </p>
<p>Commons, set out his doubts about the degree to which Saddam Hussein posed a </p>
<p>“clear and present danger” and his concerns that the UK was being “pushed too quickly </p>
<p>into conflict” by the US without the support of the UN and in the face of hostility from </p>
<p>many of the UK’s traditional allies.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>606</p>
<p><b>276.  On 17 March, President Bush issued an ultimatum giving Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>48 hours to leave Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>277. </b> The French President’s office issued a statement early on 18 March stating that </p>
<p>the US ultimatum was a unilateral decision going against the will of the international </p>
<p>community who wanted to pursue Iraqi disarmament in accordance with resolution </p>
<p>1441.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“… only the Security Council is authorised to legitimise the use of force. France </p>
<p>appeals to the responsibility of all to see that international legality is respected. </p>
<p>To disregard the legitimacy of the UN, to favour force over the law, would be to </p>
<p>take on a heavy responsibility.”</p>
<p><b>278. </b> On the evening of 18 March, the House of Commons passed by 412 votes to 149 </p>
<p>a motion supporting “the decision of Her Majesty’s Government that the United Kingdom </p>
<p>should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”.</p>
<p><b>279. </b> President Bush wrote in his memoir that he convened “the entire National Security </p>
<p>Council” on the morning of 19 March where he “gave the order to launch Operation Iraqi </p>
<p>Freedom”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>280. </b> In the Security Council debate on 19 March, the majority of members of the </p>
<p>Security Council, including France, Russia and China, made clear that they thought </p>
<p>the goal of disarming Iraq could be achieved by peaceful means and emphasised the </p>
<p>primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace </p>
<p>and security.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p><b>281. </b> UNMOVIC and the IAEA had provided the work programmes required by resolution </p>
<p>1284. They included 12 key tasks identified by UNMOVIC where progress “could have </p>
<p>an impact on the Council’s assessment of co-operation of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>282. </b> Shortly before midnight on 19 March, the US informed Sir David Manning that </p>
<p>there was to be a change to the plan and US airstrikes would be launched at 0300 GMT </p>
<p>on 20 March.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>283. </b> Early on the morning of 20 March, US forces crossed into Iraq and seized the port </p>
<p>area of Umm Qasr.</p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>607</p>
<p><b>285. </b> At Cabinet on 20 March, Mr Blair concluded that the Government:</p>
<p>“… should lose no opportunity to propagate the reason, at every level and as </p>
<p>widely as possible, why we had arrived at a diplomatic impasse, and why it was </p>
<p>necessary to take action against Iraq. France had not been prepared to accept that </p>
<p>Iraq’s failure to comply with its obligations should lead to the use of force to achieve </p>
<p>compliance.”</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>Why Iraq? Why now?</b></p>
<p><b>286. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair described his speech opening the debate on 18 March </p>
<p>as “the most important speech I had ever made”.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p><b>287. </b> Mr Blair framed the decision for the House of Commons as a “tough” and “stark” </p>
<p>choice between “retreat” and holding firm to the course of action the Government had </p>
<p>set. Mr Blair stated that he believed “passionately” in the latter. He deployed a wide </p>
<p>range of arguments to explain the grounds for military action and to make a persuasive </p>
<p>case for the Government’s policy.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>288. </b> In setting out his position, Mr Blair recognised the gravity of the debate and the </p>
<p>strength of opposition in both the country and Parliament to immediate military action. </p>
<p>In his view, the issue mattered “so much” because the outcome would not just determine </p>
<p>the fate of the Iraqi regime and the Iraqi people but would:</p>
<p>“… determine the way in which Britain and the world confront the central security </p>
<p>threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship </p>
<p>between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union </p>
<p>and the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it </p>
<p>could hardly be more important. It will determine the pattern of international politics </p>
<p>for the next generation.”</p>
<p><b>Was Iraq a serious or imminent threat?</b></p>
<p><b>289. </b> On 18 March 2003, the House of Commons was asked:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to recognise that Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles, </p>
<p>and its continuing non-compliance with Security Council resolutions, posed a </p>
<p>threat to international peace and security; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to support the use of all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, on the basis that the United Kingdom must uphold </p>
<p>the authority of the United Nations as set out in resolution 1441 and many </p>
<p>resolutions preceding it.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>608</p>
<p><b>290. </b> In his statement, Mr Blair addressed both the threat to international peace </p>
<p>and security presented by Iraq’s defiance of the UN and its failure to comply with </p>
<p>its disarmament obligations as set out in resolution 1441 (2002). Iraq was “the test </p>
<p>of whether we treat the threat seriously”.</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Mr Blair rehearsed the Government’s position on Iraq’s past pursuit and use of </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction; its failures to comply with the obligations imposed by </p>
<p>the UN Security Council between 1991 and 1998; Iraq’s repeated declarations which </p>
<p>proved to be false; and the “large quantities of weapons of mass destruction” which </p>
<p>were “unaccounted for”. He described UNSCOM’s final report (in January 1999) as </p>
<p>“a withering indictment of Saddam’s lies, deception and obstruction”.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> Mr Blair cited the UNMOVIC “clusters” document issued on 7 March as “a </p>
<p>remarkable document”, detailing “all the unanswered questions about Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction”, listing “29 different areas in which the inspectors have been unable </p>
<p>to obtain information”.</p>
<p><b>293. </b> He stated that, based on Iraq’s false declaration, its failure to co-operate, the </p>
<p>unanswered questions in the UNMOVIC “clusters” document, and the unaccounted for </p>
<p>material, the Security Council should have convened and condemned Iraq as in material </p>
<p>breach of its obligations. If Saddam Hussein continued to fail to co-operate, force should </p>
<p>be used.</p>
<p><b>294. </b> Addressing the wider message from the issue of Iraq, Mr Blair asked:</p>
<p>“… what … would any tyrannical regime possessing weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>think when viewing the history of the world’s diplomatic dance with Saddam over … </p>
<p>12 years? That our capacity to pass firm resolutions has only been matched by our </p>
<p>feebleness in implementing them.”</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Mr Blair acknowledged that Iraq was “not the only country with weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”, but declared: “back away from this confrontation now, and future conflicts </p>
<p>will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects”.</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“The real problem is that … people dispute Iraq is a threat, dispute the link between </p>
<p>terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and dispute in other words, the whole </p>
<p>basis of our assertion that the two together constitute a fundamental assault on our </p>
<p>way of life.”</p>
<p><b>297. </b> Mr Blair also described a “threat of chaos and disorder” arising from “tyrannical </p>
<p>regimes with weapons of mass destruction and extreme terrorist groups” prepared </p>
<p>to use them.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>609</p>
<p><b>298. </b> Mr Blair set out his concerns about:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>proliferators of nuclear equipment or expertise;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“dictatorships with highly repressive regimes” who were “desperately trying </p>
<p>to acquire” chemical, biological or, “particularly, nuclear weapons capability” </p>
<p>– some of those were “a short time away from having a serviceable nuclear </p>
<p>weapon”, and that activity was increasing, not diminishing; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of terrorist groups obtaining and using weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, including a “radiological bomb”.</p>
<p><b>299. </b> Those two threats had very different motives and different origins. He accepted </p>
<p>“fully” that the association between the two was:</p>
<p>“… loose – but it is hardening. The possibility of the two coming together – of </p>
<p>terrorist groups in possession of weapons of mass destruction or even of a so called </p>
<p>dirty radiological bomb – is now in my judgement, a real and present danger to </p>
<p>Britain and its national security.”</p>
<p><b>300. </b> Later in his speech, Mr Blair stated that the threat which Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>arsenal posed:</p>
<p>“… to British citizens at home and abroad cannot simply be contained. Whether in </p>
<p>the hands of his regime or in the hands of the terrorists to whom he would give his </p>
<p>weapons, they pose a clear danger to British citizens …”</p>
<p><b>301. </b> This fusion of long-standing concerns about proliferation with the post-9/11 </p>
<p>concerns about mass-casualty terrorism was at the heart of the Government’s case </p>
<p>for taking action at this time against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>302. </b> The UK assessment of Iraq’s capabilities set out in Section 4 of the Report shows:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their delivery </p>
<p>systems, particularly ballistic missiles, was regarded as a major threat. But Iran, </p>
<p>North Korea and Libya were of greater concern than Iraq in terms of the risk of </p>
<p>nuclear and missile proliferation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JIC Assessments, reflected in the September 2002 dossier, had consistently </p>
<p>taken the view that, if sanctions were removed or became ineffective, it would </p>
<p>take Iraq at least five years following the end of sanctions to produce enough </p>
<p>fissile material for a weapon. On 7 March, the IAEA had reported to the Security </p>
<p>Council that there was no indication that Iraq had resumed its nuclear activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The September dossier stated that Iraq could produce a nuclear weapon within </p>
<p>one to two years if it obtained fissile material and other essential components </p>
<p>from a foreign supplier. There was no evidence that Iraq had tried to acquire </p>
<p>fissile material and other components or – were it able to do so – that it had </p>
<p>the technical capabilities to turn these materials into a usable weapon.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>610</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JIC Assessments had identified the possible stocks of chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons which would largely have been for short-range, battlefield use by the </p>
<p>Iraqi armed forces. The JIC had also judged in the September dossier that Iraq </p>
<p>was producing chemical and biological agents and that there were development </p>
<p>programmes for longer-range missiles capable of delivering them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s proscribed Al Samoud 2 missiles were being destroyed.</p>
<p><b>303. </b> The UK Government did have significant concerns about the potential risks of all </p>
<p>types of weapons of mass destruction being obtained by Islamist extremists (in particular </p>
<p>Al Qaida) who would be prepared to use such weapons.</p>
<p><b>304.  Saddam Hussein’s regime had the potential to proliferate material and </b></p>
<p><b>know-how to terrorist groups, but it was not judged likely to do so.</b></p>
<p><b>305. </b> On 28 November 2001, the JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had “refused to permit any Al Qaida presence in Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Evidence of contact between Iraq and Usama Bin Laden (UBL) was </p>
<p>“fragmentary and uncorroborated”; including that Iraq had been in contact with </p>
<p>Al Qaida for exploratory discussions on toxic materials in late 1988.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“With common enemies … there was clearly scope for collaboration.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence that these contacts led to practical co-operation; </p>
<p>we judge it unlikely … There is no evidence UBL’s organisation has ever </p>
<p>had a presence in Iraq.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Practical co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was “unlikely because </p>
<p>of mutual mistrust”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related technology </p>
<p>and expertise to terrorist groups”.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>306. </b> On 29 January 2003, the JIC assessed that, despite the presence of terrorists in </p>
<p>Iraq “with links to Al Qaida”, there was “no intelligence of current co-operation between </p>
<p>Iraq and Al Qaida”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>307. </b> On 10 February 2003, the JIC judged that Al Qaida would “not carry out attacks </p>
<p>under Iraqi direction”.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I don’t think the Prime Minister ever accepted the link between Iraq and </p>

<p>148</p>
<p><b>309.  The JIC assessed that Iraq was likely to mount a terrorist attack only in </b></p>
<p><b>response to military action and if the existence of the regime was threatened.</b></p>
<p><b>310. </b> The JIC Assessment of 10 October 2002 stated that Saddam Hussein’s “overriding </p>
<p>objective” was to “avoid a US attack that would threaten his regime”.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> The JIC judged </p>
<p>that, in the event of US-led military action against Iraq, Saddam would:</p>
<p>“… aim to use terrorism or the threat of it. Fearing the US response, he is likely to </p>
<p>weigh the costs and benefits carefully in deciding the timing and circumstances in </p>
<p>which terrorism is used. But intelligence on Iraq’s capabilities and intentions in this </p>
<p>field is limited.”</p>
<p><b>311. </b> The JIC also judged that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam’s “capability to conduct effective terrorist attacks” was “very limited”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “terrorism capability” was “inadequate to carry out chemical or biological </p>
<p>attacks beyond individual assassination attempts using poisons”.</p>
<p><b>312. </b> The JIC Assessment of 29 January 2003 sustained its earlier judgements on Iraq’s </p>
<p>ability and intent to conduct terrorist operations.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Sir David Omand, the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator in the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>from 2002 to 2005, told the Inquiry that, in March 2002, the Security Service judged that </p>
<p>the “threat from terrorism from Saddam’s own intelligence apparatus in the event of an </p>
<p>intervention in Iraq … was judged to be limited and containable”.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Baroness Manningham-Buller, the Director General of the Security Service from </p>
<p>2002 to 2007, confirmed that position, stating that the Security Service felt there was </p>
<p>“a pretty good intelligence picture of a threat from Iraq within the UK and to British </p>
<p>interests”.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>315. </b> Baroness Manningham-Buller added that subsequent events showed the </p>
<p>judgement that Saddam Hussein did not have the capability to do anything much </p>
<p>in the UK, had “turned out to be the right judgement”.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>316.  While it was reasonable for the Government to be concerned about the </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>612</p>
<p><b>317.  The UK Government assessed that Iraq had failed to comply with a series </b></p>
<p><b>of UN resolutions. Instead of disarming as these resolutions had demanded, </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq was assessed to have concealed materials from past inspections and </b></p>
<p><b>to have taken the opportunity of the absence of inspections to revive its </b></p>
<p><b>WMD programmes.</b></p>
<p><b>318. </b> In Section 4, the Inquiry has identified the importance of the ingrained belief of the </p>
<p>Government and the intelligence community that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained </p>
<p>chemical and biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible </p>
<p>enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and </p>
<p>was pursuing an active and successful policy of deception and concealment.</p>
<p><b>319. </b> This construct remained influential despite the lack of significant finds by inspectors </p>
<p>in the period leading up to military action in March 2003, and even after the Occupation </p>
<p>of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Challenging Saddam Hussein’s “claim” that he had no weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, Mr Blair said in his speech on 18 March:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we are asked to believe that after seven years of obstruction and </p>
<p>non-compliance … he [Saddam Hussein] voluntarily decided to do what </p>
<p>he had consistently refused to do under coercion.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We are asked now seriously to accept that in the last few years – contrary to </p>
<p>all history, contrary to all intelligence – Saddam decided unilaterally to destroy </p>
<p>those weapons. I say that such a claim is palpably absurd.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… Iraq continues to deny that it has any weapons of mass destruction, although </p>
<p>no serious intelligence service anywhere in the world believes it.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What is perfectly clear is that Saddam is playing the same old games in </p>
<p>the same old way. Yes, there are minor concessions, but there has been no </p>
<p>fundamental change of heart or mind.”</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>321. </b> At no stage was the proposition that Iraq might no longer have chemical, biological </p>
<p>or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the </p>
<p>policy community.</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Intelligence and assessments were used to prepare material to be used to support </p>
<p>Government statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the </p>
<p>limitations of the intelligence.</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons on 18 March was the culmination </p>
<p>of a series of public statements and interviews setting out the urgent need for the </p>
<p>international community to act to bring about Iraq’s disarmament in accordance with </p>

<p>those resolutions, dating back to February 2002, before his meeting with President Bush </p>
<p>at Crawford on 5 and 6 April.</p>
<p><b>324. </b> As Mr Cook’s resignation statement on 17 March made clear, it was possible for </p>
<p>a Minister to draw different conclusions from the same information.</p>
<p><b>325. </b> Mr Cook set out his doubts about Saddam Hussein’s ability to deliver a strategic </p>
<p>attack and the degree to which Iraq posed a “clear and present danger” to the UK. </p>
<p>The points Mr Cook made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… neither the international community nor the British public is persuaded that </p>
<p>there is an urgent and compelling reason for this military action in Iraq.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Over the past decade that strategy [of containment] had destroyed more </p>
<p>weapons than in the Gulf War, dismantled Iraq’s nuclear weapons programme </p>
<p>and halted Saddam’s medium and long range missile programmes.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood </p>
<p>sense of the term – namely a credible device capable of being delivered against </p>
<p>a strategic city target. It probably … has biological toxins and battlefield chemical </p>
<p>munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold </p>
<p>Saddam anthrax agents and the then British Government approved chemical </p>
<p>and munitions factories. Why is it now so urgent that we should take military </p>
<p>action to disarm a military capacity that has been there for twenty years, and </p>
<p>which we helped to create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while </p>
<p>Saddam’s ambition to complete his weapons programme is blocked by the </p>
<p>presence of UN inspectors?”</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>326. </b> On 12 October 2004, announcing the withdrawal of two lines of intelligence </p>
<p>reporting which had contributed to the pre-conflict judgements on mobile biological </p>
<p>production facilities and the regime’s intentions, Mr Straw stated that he did:</p>
<p>“… not accept, even with hindsight, that we were wrong to act as we did in the </p>
<p>circumstances that we faced at the time. Even after reading all the evidence detailed </p>
<p>by the Iraq Survey Group, it is still hard to believe that any regime could behave </p>
<p>in so self-destructive a manner as to pretend that it had forbidden weaponry, when </p>
<p>in fact it had not.”</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>327. </b> Iraq had acted suspiciously over many years, which led to the inferences drawn </p>
<p>by the Government and the intelligence community that it had been seeking to protect </p>
<p>concealed WMD assets. When Iraq denied that it had retained any WMD capabilities, </p>
<p>the UK Government accused it of lying.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> This led the Government to emphasise the ability of Iraq successfully to deceive </p>
<p>the inspectors, and cast doubt on the investigative capacity of the inspectors. The role </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>614</p>
<p>of the inspectors, however, as was often pointed out, was not to seek out assets that </p>
<p>had been hidden, but rather to validate Iraqi claims.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> By March 2003, however:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Al Samoud 2 missiles which exceeded the range permitted by the UN, </p>
<p>were being destroyed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had concluded that there was no Iraqi nuclear programme of any </p>
<p>significance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors believed that they were making progress and expected to </p>
<p>achieve more co-operation from Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors were preparing to step up their activities with U2 flights and </p>
<p>interviews outside Iraq.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> When the UK sought a further Security Council resolution in March 2003, the </p>
<p>majority of the Council’s members were not persuaded that the inspections process, and </p>
<p>the diplomatic efforts surrounding it, had reached the end of the road. They did not agree </p>
<p>that the time had come to terminate inspections and resort to force. The UK went to war </p>
<p>without the explicit authorisation which it had sought from the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>331.  At the time of the Parliamentary vote of 18 March, diplomatic options had not </b></p>
<p><b>been exhausted. The point had not been reached where military action was the </b></p>

<p><b>332.  Mr Blair had been advised that an invasion of Iraq was expected to increase </b></p>
<p><b>the threat to the UK and UK interests from Al Qaida and its affiliates.</b></p>
<p><b>333. </b> Asked about the risk that attacking Iraq with cruise missiles would “act as a </p>
<p>recruiting sergeant for a young generation throughout the Islamic and Arab world”, </p>
<p>Mr Blair responded that:</p>
<p>“… what was shocking about 11 September was not just the slaughter of innocent </p>
<p>people but the knowledge that, had the terrorists been able, there would have </p>
<p>been not 3,000 innocent dead, but 30,000 or 300,000 … America did not attack the </p>
<p>Al Qaida terrorist group … [it] attacked America. They did not need to be recruited … </p>
<p>Unless we take action against them, they will grow. That is why we should act.”</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>334. </b> The JIC judged in October 2002 that “the greatest terrorist threat in the event of </p>
<p>military action against Iraq will come from Al Qaida and other Islamic extremists”; and </p>
<p>they would be “pursuing their own agenda”.</p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>615</p>
<p><b>335. </b> The JIC Assessment of 10 February 2003 repeated previous warnings that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida and associated networks would remain the greatest terrorist threat </p>
<p>to the UK and its activity would increase at the onset of any military action </p>
<p>against Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological material </p>
<p>could be transferred to terrorists, including Al Qaida.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>336. </b> Addressing the prospects for the future, the JIC Assessment concluded:</p>
<p>“… <b>Al Qaida and associated groups will continue to represent by far the </b></p>
<p><b>greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat will be heightened </b></p>
<p><b>by military action against Iraq. </b>The broader threat from Islamist terrorists will also </p>
<p>increase in the event of war, reflecting intensified anti-US/anti-Western sentiment in </p>
<p>the Muslim world, including among Muslim communities in the West. And there is a </p>
<p>risk that the transfer of CB [chemical and biological] material or expertise, during or </p>
<p>in the aftermath of conflict, will enhance Al Qaida’s capabilities.”</p>
<p><b>337. </b> In response to a call for Muslims everywhere to take up arms in defence of Iraq </p>
<p>issued by Usama Bin Laden on 11 February, and a further call on 16 February for </p>
<p>“compulsory jihad” by Muslims against the West, the JIC Assessment on 19 February </p>
<p>predicted that the upward trend in the reports of threats to the UK was likely to </p>
<p>continue.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>338. </b> The JIC continued to warn in March that the threat from Al Qaida would increase </p>
<p>at the onset of military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>339. </b> The JIC also warned that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida activity in northern Iraq continued.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida might have established sleeper cells in Baghdad, to be activated during </p>
<p>a US occupation.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> The warning about the risk of chemical and biological weapons becoming available </p>
<p>to extremist groups as a result of military action in Iraq was reiterated on 19 March.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Addressing the JIC Assessment of 10 February 2003, Mr Blair told the Intelligence </p>
<p>and Security Committee (ISC) later that year that:</p>
<p>“One of the most difficult aspects of this is that there was obviously a danger that </p>
<p>in attacking Iraq you ended up provoking the very thing you were trying to avoid. </p>

<p>judgement about this. But this is my judgement and it remains my judgement </p>
<p>and I suppose time will tell whether it’s true or it’s not true.”</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>342. </b> In its response to the ISC Report, the Government drew:</p>
<p>“… attention to the difficult judgement that had to be made and the factors on both </p>
<p>sides of the argument to be taken into account.”</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>343. </b> Baroness Manningham-Buller told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“By 2003/2004 we were receiving an increasing number of leads to terrorist activity </p>
<p>from within the UK … our involvement in Iraq radicalised, for want of a better word </p>
<p>… a few among a generation … [who] saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our </p>
<p>involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>344. </b> Asked about the proposition that it was right to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime </p>
<p>to forestall a fusion of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism at some </p>
<p>point in the future, and if it had eliminated a threat of terrorism from his regime, Baroness </p>
<p>Manningham-Buller replied:</p>
<p>“It eliminated the threat of terrorism from his direct regime; it didn’t eliminate the </p>
<p>threat of terrorism using unconventional methods … So using weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction as a terrorist weapon is still a potential threat.</p>
<p>“After all Usama Bin Laden said it was the duty of members of his organisation </p>
<p>or those in sympathy with it to acquire and use these weapons. It is interesting </p>
<p>that … such efforts as we have seen to get access to these sort of materials have </p>
<p>been low-grade and not very professional, but it must be a cause of concern to my </p>
<p>former colleagues that at some stage terrorist groups will resort to these methods. </p>
<p>In that respect, I don’t think toppling Saddam Hussein is germane to the long-term </p>
<p>ambitions of some terrorist groups to use them.”</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Asked specifically about the theory that at some point in the future Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would probably have brought together international terrorism and weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction in a threat to Western interests, Baroness Manningham-Buller </p>
<p>responded:</p>
<p>“It is a hypothetical theory. It certainly wasn’t of concern in either the short-term </p>

<p>JIC Assessments they could “have had no doubt” about that risk.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> She said that by the </p>
<p>time of the July 2005 attacks in London:</p>
<p>“… an increasing number of British-born individuals … were attracted to the ideology </p>
<p>of Usama Bin Laden and saw the West’s activities in Iraq and Afghanistan as </p>
<p>threatening their fellow religionists and the Muslim world.”</p>
<p><b>348. </b> Asked whether the judgement that the effect of the invasion of Iraq had increased </p>
<p>the terrorist threat to the UK was based on hard evidence or a broader assessment, </p>
<p>Baroness Manningham-Buller replied:</p>
<p>“I think we can produce evidence because of the numerical evidence of the number </p>
<p>of plots, the number of leads, the number of people identified, and the correlation of </p>
<p>that to Iraq and statements of people as to why they were involved … So I think the </p>
<p>answer to your … question: yes.”</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>349. </b> In its request for a statement, the Inquiry asked Mr Blair if he had read the JIC </p>
<p>Assessment of 10 February 2002, and what weight he had given to it when he decided </p>
<p>to take military action.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>350. </b> In his statement Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“I was aware of the JIC Assessment of 10 February that the Al Qaida threat to the </p>
<p>UK would increase. But I took the view then and take the same view now that to </p>
<p>have backed down because of the threat of terrorism would be completely wrong. </p>
<p>In any event, following 9/11 and Afghanistan we were a terrorist target and, as recent </p>
<p>events in Europe and the US show, irrespective of Iraq, there are ample justifications </p>
<p>such terrorists will use as excuses for terrorism.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>618</p>
<p>in Afghanistan, in the “Global War on Terror”. In that period, the US Administration turned </p>
<p>against a strategy of continued containment of Iraq, which it was pursuing before the </p>
<p>9/11 attacks.</p>
<p><b>353. </b> This was not, initially, the view of the UK Government. Its stated view at that time </p>
<p>was that containment had been broadly effective, and that it could be adapted in order </p>
<p>to remain sustainable. Containment continued to be the declared policy of the UK </p>
<p>throughout the first half of 2002.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> The declared objectives of the UK and the US towards Iraq up to the time of the </p>
<p>invasion differed. The US was explicitly seeking to achieve a change of regime; the UK </p>
<p>to achieve the disarmament of Iraq, as required by UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p><b>355. </b> Most crucially, the US Administration committed itself to a timetable for military </p>
<p>action which did not align with, and eventually overrode, the timetable and processes </p>
<p>for inspections in Iraq which had been set by the UN Security Council. The UK wanted </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA to have time to complete their work, and wanted the support of </p>
<p>the Security Council, and of the international community more widely, before any further </p>
<p>steps were taken. This option was foreclosed by the US decision.</p>
<p><b>356. </b> On these and other important points, including the planning for the post-conflict </p>
<p>period and the functioning of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), the UK </p>
<p>Government decided that it was right or necessary to defer to its close ally and senior </p>
<p>partner, the US.</p>
<p><b>357. </b> It did so essentially for two reasons:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concern that vital areas of co-operation between the UK and the US could </p>
<p>be damaged if the UK did not give the US its full support over Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The belief that the best way to influence US policy towards the direction </p>
<p>preferred by the UK was to commit full and unqualified support, and seek </p>
<p>to persuade from the inside.</p>
<p><b>358. </b> The UK Government was right to think very carefully about both of these points.</p>
<p><b>359. </b> First, the close strategic alliance with the US has been a cornerstone of the UK’s </p>
<p>foreign and security policy under successive governments since the Second World War. </p>
<p>Mr Blair rightly attached great importance to preserving and strengthening it.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> After the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, that relationship was reinforced </p>
<p>when Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US to </p>
<p>defeat and eradicate international terrorism.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> The action that followed in Afghanistan </p>
<p>to bring about the fall of the Taliban served to strengthen and deepen the sense of </p>
<p>shared endeavour.</p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>619</p>
<p><b>361. </b> When the US Administration turned its attention to regime change in Iraq as part </p>
<p>of the second phase of the “Global War on Terror”, Mr Blair’s immediate response was </p>
<p>to seek to offer a partnership and to work with it to build international support for the </p>
<p>position that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with.</p>
<p><b>362. </b> In Mr Blair’s view, the decision to stand alongside the US was in the UK’s </p>
<p>long-term national interests. In his speech of 18 March 2003, he argued that the </p>
<p>handling of Iraq would:</p>
<p>“… determine the way in which Britain and the world confront the central security </p>
<p>threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship </p>
<p>between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union and </p>
<p>the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it could </p>
<p>hardly be more important. It will determine the pattern of international politics for the </p>
<p>next generation.”</p>
<p><b>363. </b> In his memoir in 2010, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“I knew in the final analysis I would be with the US, because it was right morally and </p>
<p>strategically. But we should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution. First </p>
<p>to make the moral case for removing Saddam … Second, to try one more time to </p>
<p>reunite the international community behind a clear base for action in the event of </p>
<p>a continuing breach.”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Concern about the consequences, were the UK not to give full support to the US, </p>
<p>featured prominently in policy calculations across Whitehall. Mr Hoon, for example, </p>
<p>sought advice from Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, on the </p>
<p>implications for the alliance of the UK’s approach to Iraq.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Although there has historically been a very close relationship between the British </p>
<p>and American peoples and a close identity of values between our democracies, it is an </p>
<p>alliance founded not on emotion, but on a hard-headed appreciation of mutual benefit. </p>
<p>The benefits do not by any means flow only in one direction.</p>
<p><b>366. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“… I agreed with the basic US analysis of Saddam as a threat; I thought he was a </p>
<p>monster; and to break the US partnership in such circumstances, when America’s </p>
<p>key allies were all rallying round, would in my view, then (and now) have done major </p>
<p>long-term damage to that relationship.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>620</p>
<p><b>367. </b> The Government was right to weigh the possible consequences for the wider </p>
<p>alliance with the US very carefully, as previous Governments have done. A policy </p>
<p>of direct opposition to the US would have done serious short-term damage to the </p>
<p>relationship, but it is questionable whether it would have broken the partnership.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Over the past seven decades, the UK and US have adopted differing, and </p>
<p>sometimes conflicting, positions on major issues, for example Suez, the Vietnam </p>
<p>War, the Falklands, Grenada, Bosnia, the Arab/Israel dispute and, at times, Northern </p>
<p>Ireland. Those differences did not fundamentally call into question the practice of </p>
<p>close cooperation, to mutual advantage, on the overall relationship, including defence </p>
<p>and intelligence.</p>
<p><b>369. </b> The opposition of Germany and France to US policy in 2002 to 2003 does not </p>
<p>appear to have had a lasting impact on the relationships of those countries with the </p>
<p>US, despite the bitterness at the time.</p>
<p><b>370. </b> However, a decision not to oppose does not have to be translated into unqualified </p>
<p>support. Throughout the post-Second World War period (and, notably, during the </p>
<p>wartime alliance), the UK’s relationship with the US and the commonality of interests </p>
<p>therein have proved strong enough to bear the weight of different approaches to </p>
<p>international problems and not infrequent disagreements.</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Had the UK stood by its differing position on Iraq – which was not an opposed </p>
<p>position, but one in which the UK had identified conditions seen as vital by the UK </p>
<p>Government – the Inquiry does not consider that this would have led to a fundamental </p>
<p>or lasting change in the UK’s relationship with the US.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> This is a matter of judgement, and one on which Mr Blair, bearing the responsibility </p>
<p>of leadership, took a different view.</p>
<p><b>373. </b> The second reason for committing unqualified support was, by standing alongside </p>
<p>and taking part in the planning, the UK would be able to influence US policy.</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Mr Blair’s stalwart support for the US after 9/11 had a significant impact in that </p>
<p>country. Mr Blair developed a close working relationship with President Bush. He used </p>
<p>this to compare notes and inject his views on the major issues of the day, and it is clear </p>
<p>from the records of the discussions that President Bush encouraged that dialogue and </p>
<p>listened to Mr Blair’s opinions.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Mr Blair expressed his views in frequent telephone calls and in meetings with the </p>
<p>President. There was also a very active channel between his Foreign Affairs Adviser and </p>
<p>the President’s National Security Advisor. Mr Blair also sent detailed written Notes to </p>
<p>the President.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>621</p>
<p><b>376. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the Prime Minister had a habit of writing notes, both internally and to President </p>
<p>Clinton and to President Bush, on all sorts of subjects, because he found it better </p>
<p>to put something in writing rather than to simply talk about it orally and get it much </p>
<p>more concretely … in focused terms.”</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Blair drew on information and briefing received from Whitehall departments, </p>
<p>but evidently drafted many or most of his Notes to the President himself, showing </p>
<p>the drafts to his close advisers in No.10 but not (ahead of despatch) to the relevant </p>
<p>Cabinet Ministers.</p>
<p><b>378. </b> How best to exercise influence with the President of the United States is a matter </p>
<p>for the tactical judgement of the Prime Minister, and will vary between Prime Ministers </p>
<p>and Presidents. In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair’s judgement, as he and others have </p>
<p>explained, was that objectives the UK identified for a successful strategy should not </p>
<p>be expressed as conditions for its support.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that Mr Blair was offering the US a “partnership to try </p>
<p>to get to a wide coalition” and “setting out a framework” and to try to persuade the US </p>
<p>to move in a particular direction.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr Blair undoubtedly influenced the President’s decision to go to the UN Security </p>
<p>Council in the autumn of 2002. On other critical decisions set out in the Report, he did </p>
<p>not succeed in changing the approach determined in Washington.</p>
<p><b>The legal basis for military action and the authority of the UN</b></p>
<p><b>381. </b> There was a vigorous debate in late 2002 and early 2003 about the legal effect </p>
<p>of resolution 1441 and the question of whether military action against Iraq could be </p>
<p>undertaken without the Security Council having first considered, and then assessed, </p>
<p>whether or not Iraq was in breach of its terms.</p>
<p><b>382. </b> Many distinguished jurists have expressed opinions on that question and the </p>
<p>debate will no doubt continue. The Inquiry received many opinions from experts in </p>
<p>international law which demonstrate the complexities of the issues.</p>
<p><b>383. </b> The Inquiry has reviewed the debate that took place within the Government and </p>
<p>how it reached its decision.</p>
<p><b>384. </b> The circumstances in which it was ultimately decided that there was a legal basis </p>
<p>for UK participation were far from satisfactory.</p>
<p><b>385. </b> It was not until 13 March 2003 that Lord Goldsmith advised that there was, </p>
<p>on balance, a secure legal basis for military action.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>622</p>
<p><b>386. </b> In the letter of 14 March 2003 from Lord Goldsmith's office to No.10, which is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 5 of the Report, Mr Blair was told that an essential ingredient of the </p>
<p>legal basis was that he, himself, should be satisfied of the fact that Iraq was in breach of </p>
<p>resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>387. </b> In accordance with that advice, it was Mr Blair who decided that, so far as the UK </p>
<p>was concerned, Iraq was and remained in breach of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Apart from No.10’s response to the letter of 14 March, sent the following day, </p>
<p>in terms that can only be described as perfunctory, no formal record was made of that </p>
<p>decision and the precise grounds on which it was made remain unclear.</p>
<p><b>389. </b> The Inquiry was told, and it accepts, that it would have been possible at that stage </p>
<p>for the UK Government to have decided not to go ahead with military action if it had </p>
<p>been necessary to make a decision to do so; or if the House of Commons on 18 March </p>
<p>had voted against the Government.</p>
<p><b>390. </b> Although there had been unanimous support for a rigorous inspections and </p>
<p>monitoring regime backed by the threat of military force as the means to disarm Iraq </p>
<p>when resolution 1441 was adopted, there was no such consensus in the Security </p>
<p>Council in March 2003. If the matter had been left to the Security Council to decide, </p>
<p>military action might have been postponed and, possibly, avoided.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> The Charter of the United Nations vests responsibility for the maintenance of </p>
<p>peace and security in the Security Council. The UK Government was claiming to act on </p>
<p>behalf of the international community “to uphold the authority of the Security Council”, </p>
<p>knowing that it did not have a majority in the Security Council in support of its actions. In </p>
<p>those circumstances, the UK’s actions undermined the authority of the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>392. </b> A determination by the Security Council on whether Iraq was in fact in material </p>
<p>breach of resolution 1441 would have furthered the UK’s aspiration to uphold the </p>
<p>authority of the Council.</p>
<p><b>Decision-making</b></p>
<p><b>393. </b> The way in which the policy on Iraq was developed and decisions were taken and </p>
<p>implemented within the UK Government has been at the heart of the Inquiry’s work and </p>
<p>fundamental to its conclusions.</p>
<p><b>394. </b> The Inquiry has set out in Section 2 of the Report the roles and responsibilities </p>
<p>of key individuals and bodies in order to assist the reader. It is also publishing with the </p>
<p>Report many of the documents which illuminate who took the key decisions and on what </p>
<p>basis, including the full record of the discussion on Iraq in Cabinet on five key occasions </p>
<p>pre-conflict, and policy advice to Ministers which is not normally disclosed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>623</p>
<p><b>Collective responsibility</b></p>
<p><b>395. </b> Under UK constitutional conventions – in which the Prime Minister leads the </p>
<p>Government – Cabinet is the main mechanism by which the most senior members </p>
<p>of the Government take collective responsibility for its most important decisions. </p>
<p>Cabinet is supported by a system of Ministerial Committees whose role is to identify, </p>
<p>test and develop policy options; analyse and mitigate risks; and debate and hone </p>
<p>policy proposals until they are endorsed across the Government.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>396. </b> The <i>Ministerial Code</i> in place in 2003 said:</p>
<p>“The Cabinet is supported by Ministerial Committees (both standing and ad hoc) </p>
<p>which have a two-fold purpose. First, they relieve the pressure on the Cabinet </p>
<p>itself by settling as much business as possible at a lower level or, failing that, by </p>
<p>clarifying the issues and defining the points of disagreement. Second, they support </p>
<p>the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though an important </p>
<p>question may never reach the Cabinet itself, the decision will be fully considered and </p>
<p>the final judgement will be sufficiently authoritative to ensure that the Government as </p>
<p>a whole can properly be expected to accept responsibility for it.”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>397. </b> The Code also said:</p>
<p>“The business of the Cabinet and Ministerial Committees consists in the main of:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>questions which significantly engage the collective responsibility of the </p>
<p>Government because they raise major issues of policy or because they </p>
<p>are of critical importance to the public;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>questions on which there is an unresolved argument between </p>
<p>Departments.”</p>
<p><b>398. </b> Lord Wilson of Dinton told the Inquiry that between January 1998 and January </p>
<p>1999, in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of Operation Desert Fox in December </p>
<p>1998 (see Section 1.1), as Cabinet Secretary, he had attended and noted 21 Ministerial </p>
<p>discussions on Iraq: 10 in Cabinet, of which seven had “some substance”; five in DOP; </p>
<p>and six ad hoc meetings, including one JIC briefing.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> Discussions in Cabinet or a </p>
<p>Cabinet Committee would have been supported by the relevant part of the Cabinet </p>
<p>Secretariat, the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec).</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Similarly, Lord Wilson stated that, between 11 September 2001 and January 2002, </p>
<p>the Government’s response to international terrorism and the subsequent military action </p>
<p>against the Taliban in Afghanistan had been managed through 46 Ministerial meetings.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>624</p>
<p><b>400. </b> The last meeting of DOP on Iraq before the 2003 conflict, however, took place </p>
<p>in March 1999.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>401. </b> In April 2002, the MOD clearly expected consideration of military options to be </p>
<p>addressed through DOP. Mr Simon Webb, the MOD Policy Director, advised Mr Hoon </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“Even these preparatory steps would properly need a Cabinet Committee decision, </p>
<p>based on a minute from the Defence Secretary …”</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>402. </b> Most decisions on Iraq pre-conflict were taken either bilaterally between Mr Blair </p>
<p>and the relevant Secretary of State or in meetings between Mr Blair, Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Mr Hoon, with No.10 officials and, as appropriate, Mr John Scarlett (Chairman of the </p>
<p>JIC), Sir Richard Dearlove and Adm Boyce. Some of those meetings were minuted; </p>
<p>some were not.</p>
<p><b>403. </b> As the guidance for the Cabinet Secretariat makes clear, the purpose of the minute </p>
<p>of a meeting is to set out the conclusions reached so that those who have to take </p>
<p>action know precisely what to do; the second purpose is to “give the reasons why the </p>
<p>conclusions were reached”.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from 2002 to 2005, described Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>characteristic way of working with his Cabinet colleagues as:</p>
<p>“… ‘I like to move fast. I don't want to spend a lot of time in kind of conflict resolution, </p>
<p>and, therefore, I will get the people who will make this thing move quickly and </p>
<p>efficiently.’ That was his sort of characteristic style, but it has drawbacks.”</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Lord Turnbull subsequently told the Inquiry that the group described above was </p>
<p>“a professional forum … they had … with one possible exception [Ms Clare Short, the </p>
<p>International Development Secretary], the right people in the room. It wasn’t the kind </p>
<p>of sofa government in the sense of the Prime Minister and his special advisers and </p>
<p>political cronies”.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>406. </b> In July 2004, Lord Butler’s Report stated that his Committee was:</p>
<p>“… concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the Government’s </p>
<p>procedures which we saw in the context of policy-making towards Iraq risks reducing </p>
<p>the scope for informed collective political judgement. Such risks are particularly </p>
<p>significant in a field like the subject of our Review, where hard facts are inherently </p>

<p>difficult to come by and the quality of judgement is accordingly all the more </p>
<p>important.”</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>407. </b> In response, Mr Blair agreed that:</p>
<p>“… where a small group is brought together to work on operational military planning </p>
<p>and developing the diplomatic strategy, in future such a group will operate formally </p>
<p>as an ad hoc Cabinet Committee.”</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>408. </b> The Inquiry considers that where policy options include significant military </p>
<p>deployments, particularly where they will have implications for the responsibilities of </p>
<p>more than one Cabinet Minister, are likely to be controversial, and/or are likely to give </p>
<p>rise to significant risks, the options should be considered by a group of Ministers meeting </p>
<p>regularly, whether or not they are formally designated as a Cabinet Committee, so that </p>
<p>Cabinet as a whole can be enabled to take informed collective decisions.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Describing the important function a Cabinet Committee can play, Mr Powell wrote:</p>
<p>“Most of the important decisions of the Blair Government were taken either in </p>
<p>informal meetings of Ministers and officials or by Cabinet Committees … Unlike </p>
<p>the full Cabinet, a Cabinet Committee has the right people present, including, </p>
<p>for example, the military Chiefs of Staff or scientific advisers, its members are </p>
<p>well briefed, it can take as long as it likes over its discussion on the basis of </p>
<p>well-prepared papers, and it is independently chaired by a senior Minister with </p>
<p>no departmental vested interest.”</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>410. </b> The Inquiry concurs with this description of the function of a Cabinet Committee </p>
<p>when it is working well. In particular, it recognises the important function which a Minister </p>
<p>without departmental responsibilities for the issues under consideration can play. This </p>
<p>can provide some external challenge from experienced members of the government and </p>
<p>mitigate any tendency towards group-think. In the case of Iraq, for example, the inclusion </p>
<p>of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Deputy Prime Minister, as senior members of the </p>
<p>Cabinet, or of Mr Cook, as a former Foreign Secretary known to have concerns about </p>
<p>the policy, could have provided an element of challenge.</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Mr Powell likewise recognises the importance of having written advice which can </p>
<p>be seen before a meeting, allowing all those present to have shared information and </p>
<p>the opportunity to digest it and seek further advice if necessary. This allows the time </p>
<p>in meetings to be used productively.</p>
<p><b>412. </b> The Inquiry considers that there should have been collective discussion by a </p>
<p>Cabinet Committee or small group of Ministers on the basis of inter-departmental advice </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>626</p>
<p>agreed at a senior level between officials at a number of decision points which had a </p>
<p>major impact on the development of UK policy before the invasion of Iraq. Those were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision at the beginning of December 2001 to offer to work with President </p>
<p>Bush on a strategy to deal with Iraq as part of Phase 2 of the “War on Terror”, </p>
<p>despite the fact that there was no evidence of any Iraqi involvement with the </p>
<p>attacks on the US or active links to Al Qaida.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The adoption of the position at the end of February 2002 that Iraq was a threat </p>
<p>which had to be dealt with, together with the assumption that the only certain </p>
<p>means to remove Saddam Hussein and his regime was to invade Iraq and </p>
<p>impose a new government.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The position Mr Blair should adopt in discussions with President Bush at </p>
<p>Crawford in April 2002. The meeting at Chequers on 2 April was given a </p>
<p>presentation on the military options and did not explore the political and legal </p>
<p>implications of a conflict with Iraq. There was no FCO representative at the </p>
<p>Chequers meeting and no subsequent meeting with Mr Straw and Mr Hoon.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The position Mr Blair should adopt in his discussion with President Bush at </p>
<p>Camp David on 5 and 6 September 2002. Mr Blair’s long Note of 28 July, telling </p>
<p>President Bush “I will be with you, whatever”, was seen, before it was sent, only </p>
<p>by No.10 officials. A copy was sent afterwards to Mr Straw, but not to Mr Hoon. </p>
<p>While the Note was marked “Personal” (to signal that it should have a restricted </p>
<p>circulation), it represented an extensive statement of the UK Government’s </p>
<p>position by the Prime Minister to the President of the United States. The Foreign </p>
<p>and Defence Secretaries should certainly have been given an opportunity to </p>
<p>comment on the draft in advance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A discussion in mid-September 2002 on the need for robust post-conflict </p>
<p>planning.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision on 31 October 2002 to offer ground forces to the US for planning </p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision on 17 January 2003 to deploy large scale ground forces for </p>
<p>operations in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The position Mr Blair should adopt in his discussion with President Bush </p>
<p>in Washington on 31 January 2003.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The proposals in Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 19 February suggesting </p>
<p>a deadline for a vote in the Security Council of 14 March.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A review of UK policy at the end of February 2003 when the inspectors had </p>
<p>found no evidence of WMD and there was only limited support for the second </p>
<p>resolution in the Security Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The question of whether Iraq had committed further material breaches </p>
<p>as specified in operative paragraph 4 of resolution 1441 (2002), as posed </p>
<p>in Mr Brummell’s letter of 14 March to Mr Rycroft.</p>

<p>627</p>
<p><b>413. </b> In addition to providing a mechanism to probe and challenge the implications </p>
<p>of proposals before decisions were taken, a Cabinet Committee or a more structured </p>
<p>process might have identified some of the wider implications and risks associated with </p>
<p>the deployment of military forces to Iraq. It might also have offered the opportunity to </p>
<p>remedy some of the deficiencies in planning which are identified in Section 6 of the </p>
<p>Report. There will, of course, be other policy issues which would benefit from the </p>
<p>same approach.</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Cabinet has a different role to that of a Cabinet Committee.</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Powell has written that:</p>
<p>“… Cabinet is the right place to ratify decisions, the right place for people to raise </p>
<p>concerns if they have not done so before, the right place for briefings by the Prime </p>
<p>Minister and other Ministers on strategic issues, the right place to ensure political </p>
<p>unity; but it is categorically not the right place for an informed decision on difficult </p>
<p>and detailed policy issues.”</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>416. </b> In 2009, in a statement explaining a Cabinet decision to veto the release of </p>
<p>minutes of one of its meetings under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, Mr Straw </p>
<p>explained the need for frank discussion at Cabinet very cogently:</p>
<p>“Serious and controversial decisions must be taken with free, frank – even blunt </p>
<p>deliberations between colleagues. Dialogue must be fearless. Ministers must have </p>
<p>the confidence to challenge each other in private. They must ensure that decisions </p>
<p>have been properly thought through, sounding out all possibilities before committing </p>
<p>themselves to a course of action. They must not feel inhibited from advancing </p>
<p>options that may be unpopular or controversial. They must not be deflected from </p>
<p>expressing dissent by the fear that they may be held personally to account for views </p>
<p>that are later cast aside.”</p>
<p>191</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… the discussion that we had in Cabinet was substantive discussion. We had it </p>
<p>again and again and again, and the options were very simple. The options were: </p>
<p>a sanctions framework that was effective; alternatively, the UN inspectors doing </p>
<p>the job; alternatively, you have to remove Saddam. Those were the options.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>628</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“Nobody in the Cabinet was unaware of … what the whole issue was about. It was </p>
<p>the thing running throughout the whole of the political mainstream at the time. There </p>
<p>were members of the Cabinet who would challenge and disagree, but most of them </p>
<p>agreed.”</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>419. </b> The Inquiry has seen the minutes of 26 meetings of Cabinet between 28 February </p>
<p>2002 and 17 March 2003 at which Iraq was mentioned and Cabinet Secretariat </p>
<p>notebooks. Cabinet was certainly given updates on diplomatic developments and had </p>
<p>opportunities to discuss the general issues. The number of occasions on which there </p>
<p>was a substantive discussion of the policy was very much more limited.</p>
<p><b>420. </b> There were substantive discussions of the policy on Iraq, although (as the Report </p>
<p>sets out) not necessarily of all the issues, in Cabinet on 7 March and 23 September </p>
<p>2002 and 16 January, 13 March and 17 March 2003. Those are the records which are </p>
<p>being published with the Report.</p>
<p><b>421. </b> At the Cabinet meeting on 7 March 2002, Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“… the concerns expressed in discussion were justified. It was important that the </p>
<p>United States did not appear to be acting unilaterally. It was critically important </p>
<p>to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. Any military action taken against </p>
<p>President Saddam Hussein’s regime had to be effective. On the other hand, the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime was in clear breach of its obligations under several United Nations </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions. Its WMD programmes posed a threat to peace. Iraq’s </p>
<p>neighbours regarded President Saddam Hussein as a danger. The right strategy </p>
<p>was to engage closely with the Government of the United States in order to be in </p>
<p>a position to shape policy and its presentation. The international community should </p>
<p>proceed in a measured but determined way to decide how to respond to the real </p>
<p>threat represented by the Iraqi regime. No decisions to launch military action had </p>
<p>been taken and any action taken would be in accordance with international law.</p>
<p>“The Cabinet, ‘Took note, with approval.’”</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>422. </b> Cabinet on 17 March 2003 noted Mr Blair’s conclusion that “the diplomatic process </p>
<p>was at an end; Saddam Hussein would be given an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the </p>
<p>House of Commons would be asked to endorse the use of military action against Iraq to </p>
<p>enforce compliance, if necessary”.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> In Section 5 of the Report, the Inquiry concludes that Lord Goldsmith should have </p>
<p>been asked to provide written advice which fully reflected the position on 17 March and </p>
<p>explained the legal basis on which the UK could take military action and set out the risks </p>
<p>of legal challenge.</p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 7 March 2002.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>629</p>
<p><b>424. </b> There was no substantive discussion of the military options, despite promises </p>
<p>by Mr Blair, before the meeting on 17 March.</p>
<p><b>425. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Hoon wrote that by the time he joined Cabinet, </p>
<p>in 1999:</p>
<p>“… the pattern of the organisation and format of Cabinet meetings was … well </p>
<p>established. Tony Blair was well known to be extremely concerned about leaks </p>
<p>from Cabinet discussions … It was my perception that, largely as a consequence </p>
<p>of this, he did not normally expect key decisions to be made in the course of Cabinet </p>
<p>meetings. Papers were submitted to the Cabinet Office, and in turn by the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office to appropriate Cabinet Committees for decisions.”</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>426. </b> Mr Hoon wrote:</p>
<p>“At no time when I was serving in the Ministry of Defence were other Cabinet </p>
<p>Ministers involved in discussions about the deployment of specific forces and </p>
<p>the nature of their operations. Relevant details would have been circulated to </p>
<p>10 Downing Street or other Government departments as necessary … I do not </p>
<p>recall a single Cabinet level discussion of specific troop deployments and the nature </p>
<p>of their operations.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>427. </b> The Inquiry recognises that there will be operational constraints on discussion </p>
<p>of the details of military deployments, but that would not preclude the discussion of </p>
<p>the principles and the implications of military options.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> In January 2006, the Cabinet discussed the proposal to deploy military forces </p>
<p>to Helmand later that year.</p>
<p><b>429. </b> The Inquiry also recognises that the nature of foreign policy, as the Report vividly </p>
<p>demonstrates, requires the Prime Minister of the UK, the Foreign Secretary and their </p>
<p>most senior officials to be involved in negotiating and agreeing policy on a day-by-day, </p>
<p>and sometimes hour-by-hour basis.</p>
<p><b>430. </b> It would neither be necessary nor feasible to seek a mandate from Cabinet at </p>
<p>each stage of a discussion. That reinforces the importance of ensuring Cabinet is kept </p>
<p>informed as strategy evolves, is given the opportunity to raise questions and is asked to </p>
<p>endorse key decisions. Cabinet Ministers need more information than will be available </p>
<p>from the media, especially on sensitive issues of foreign and security policy.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>630</p>
<p>“… each of us, as Secretary of the Cabinet, has been constantly conscious of </p>
<p>his responsibility to the Cabinet collectively and of the need to have regard to the </p>
<p>needs and responsibilities of the other members of the Cabinet (and indeed of other </p>
<p>Ministers) as well of those of the Prime Minister. That has coloured our relationships </p>
<p>with Number 10 as well as those with other Ministers and their departments.”</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>432. </b> Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… wanted a step change in the work on delivery and reform, which I hope I </p>
<p>managed to give him. Now … how does the Cabinet Secretary work? You come </p>
<p>in and you are – even with the two roles that you have, head of an organisation </p>
<p>of half a million civil servants and in some sense co-ordinating a public sector </p>
<p>of about five million people. You have to make choices as to where you make your </p>
<p>effort, and I think the policy I followed was not to take an issue over from someone </p>
<p>to whom it was delegated simply because it was big and important, but you have </p>
<p>to make a judgement as to whether it is being handled competently, whether that </p>
<p>particular part is, in a sense, under pressure, whether you think they are getting it </p>
<p>wrong in some sense, or they are missing certain important things.”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>433. </b> The responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary to ensure that members of Cabinet are </p>
<p>fully engaged in ways that allow them to accept collective responsibility and to meet their </p>
<p>departmental obligations nevertheless remains.</p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>434. </b> In a democratic system, public support and understanding for a major military </p>
<p>operation are essential. It is therefore important to guard against overstating what </p>
<p>military action might achieve and against any tendency to play down the risks. A realistic </p>
<p>assessment of the possibilities and limitations of armed force, and of the challenges of </p>
<p>intervening in the affairs of other States, should help any future UK Government manage </p>
<p>expectations, including its own.</p>
<p><b>435. </b> When the potential for military action arises, the Government should not commit to </p>
<p>a firm political objective before it is clear that it can be achieved. Regular reassessment </p>
<p>is essential, to ensure that the assumptions upon which policy is being made and </p>
<p>implemented remain correct.</p>
<p><b>436. </b> Once an issue becomes a matter for the Security Council, the UK Government </p>
<p>cannot expect to retain control of how it is to be discussed and eventually decided </p>
<p>unless it is able to work with the interests and agendas of other Member States. </p>
<p>In relation to Iraq, the independent role of the inspectors was a further dimension.</p>

<p>7  |  Conclusions: Pre-conflict strategy and planning</p>
<p>631</p>
<p><b>437. </b> A military timetable should not be allowed to dictate a diplomatic timetable. If a </p>
<p>strategy of coercive diplomacy is being pursued, forces should be deployed in such a </p>
<p>way that the threat of action can be increased or decreased according to the diplomatic </p>
<p>situation and the policy can be sustained for as long as necessary.</p>
<p><b>438. </b> The issue of influencing the US, both at the strategic and at the operational level, </p>
<p>was a constant preoccupation at all levels of the UK Government.</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Prime Ministers will always wish to exercise their own political judgement on </p>
<p>how to handle the relationship with the US. It will depend on personal relationships as </p>
<p>well as on the nature of the issues being addressed. On all these matters of strategy </p>
<p>and diplomacy, the Inquiry recognises that there is no standard formula that will be </p>
<p>appropriate in all cases.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Whether or not influence has been exercised can be difficult to ascertain, even </p>
<p>in retrospect. The views of allies are most likely to make a difference when they come </p>
<p>in one side of an internal debate, and there are a number of instances where the UK </p>
<p>arguments did make a difference to the formation and implementation of US policy. </p>
<p>The US and UK are close allies, but the relationship between the two is unequal.</p>
<p><b>441. </b> The exercise of influence will always involve a combination of identifying the </p>
<p>prerequisites for success in a shared endeavour, and a degree of bargaining to make </p>
<p>sure that the approach meets the national interest. In situations like the run-up to the </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If certain measures are identified as prerequisite for success then their </p>
<p>importance should be underlined from the start. There are no prizes for sharing </p>
<p>a failure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those measures that are most important should be pursued persistently and </p>
<p>consistently.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If it is assumed that a consequence of making a contribution in one area is that </p>
<p>a further contribution would not be required in another, then that should be made </p>
<p>explicit.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Influence should not be set as an objective in itself. The exercise of influence </p>
<p>is a means to an end.</p>
