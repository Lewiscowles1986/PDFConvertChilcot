<p>3</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the framework for and conduct of UK combat operations, </p>
<p>specifically: </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>transition to post-conflict operations in Iraq; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the establishment of the UK’s post-conflict Area of Responsibility (AOR) </p>
<p>in the South.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> The Inquiry has not addressed the detailed operational and tactical conduct of the </p>
<p>military campaign. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> A number of issues which are relevant to this Section are addressed in other Sections </p>
<p>of the Report, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s military planning for the invasion is addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, </p>
<p>including decisions about the forces to be committed, assessments of Iraq’s </p>
<p>conventional capabilities, the regime’s intentions, the possible responses of the </p>
<p>regime and the Iraqi people to a military invasion, and the legal framework for </p>
<p>the conduct of operations. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s assessment of Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons (CBW) and its </p>
<p>ability to deploy them, including its ballistic missile capabilities, are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 4.1. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith’s advice on the legal basis for military action is addressed in </p>

<p>role, which was described as Phase IV of the campaign plan, is addressed in </p>
<p>Sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK Government’s decision to take military action is described in Section 3.8.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>considered in Sections 16.1 to 16.4.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The search for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 4.4.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The evolution of the US/UK non-military relationship, political developments in </p>
<p>Iraq and the adoption of resolution 1483 (2003) are addressed in Section 9.1.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It took less than a month to achieve the departure of Saddam Hussein and the fall </p>
<p>of Baghdad.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision to advance into Basra was made by military commanders on the </p>
<p>ground. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was unprepared for the media response to the initial difficulties. It had also </p>
<p>underestimated the need for sustained communication of key strategic messages </p>
<p>to inform public opinion about the objectives and progress of the military campaign, </p>
<p>including in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For any future military operations, arrangements to agree and disseminate key </p>
<p>strategic messages need to be put in place, in both London and on the ground, </p>
<p>before operations begin. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK acceded to the post-invasion US request that it assume leadership of a </p>
<p>military Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompassing four provinces in southern Iraq, </p>
<p>a position it then held for six years, without a formal Ministerial decision and without </p>
<p>carrying out a robust analysis of the strategic implications for the UK or the military’s </p>
<p>capacity to support the UK’s potential obligations in the region. </p>
<p><b>The military Coalition</b></p>
<p><b>4.  The combat phase of military operations is widely judged to have been a </b></p>
<p><b>success. The Iraqi armed forces were defeated so rapidly by the Coalition that US </b></p>
<p><b>forces were in Baghdad and Saddam Hussein’s regime had fallen by 14 April 2003. </b></p>
<p><b>On 1 May, just six weeks after launching the invasion, President Bush declared </b></p>
<p><b>that major combat operations had ended.</b></p>
<p><b>5.  Those who deployed on the operation and those who planned and supported it, </b></p>
<p><b>military and civilian, deserve recognition for what they achieved. </b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> Coalition Forces were led by General Tommy Franks, the Commander in Chief </p>
<p>US Central Command (CENTCOM). The Coalition campaign was designated Operation </p>
<p>Iraqi Freedom. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Gen Franks recorded in his memoir that, by the third week of March 2003, “total </p>
<p>strength in all components – including our Gulf State Coalition allies in Kuwait” </p>
<p>numbered 292,000 individuals, including ground forces of around 170,000.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>8. </b> At a press briefing on 18 March 2003, Mr Richard Boucher, the US State </p>
<p>Department Spokesman, gave a “definitive list” of 30 countries</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> that had agreed to </p>
<p>be part of the Coalition, each of which was “contributing in the ways that it deems </p>

<p>2 </p>
<p>Afghanistan, Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, </p>
<p>Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, </p>
<p>the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, the UK and </p>
<p>Uzbekistan. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>the most appropriate”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> Mr Boucher said that “almost all” of the 30 were “associated </p>
<p>somehow militarily with the action”. A further 15 countries, which he did not list, were </p>
<p>“co-operating”, for example by offering “defensive assets in the event that Saddam </p>
<p>resorts to the use of weapons of mass destruction”. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The MOD’s first account and analysis of the operation, published in July 2003, gave </p>
<p>the total number of Coalition Forces as 467,000.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> The MOD also recorded that “some </p>
<p>20 countries offered or provided military forces or use of military bases” and “many </p>
<p>others provided crucial assistance with intelligence, logistics and the deployment of </p>
<p>combat units”. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> According to Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor in </p>
<p>March 2003, a total of 33 countries provided troops in support of the military operation.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> President Bush put the number of countries providing “crucial support – from the use </p>
<p>of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics” at more than 35.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The UK contribution</b></p>
<p><b>12. </b> UK military operations in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 were known by the </p>
<p>codename Operation TELIC.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> At the start of Op TELIC, the UK deployed a large scale ground force and medium </p>
<p>scale air and maritime forces, totalling 46,150 personnel, to Iraq.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>UK forces already in the Gulf</b></p>
<p>As described in Section 1.1, after the 1991 Gulf Conflict a Royal Navy frigate or destroyer </p>
<p>was permanently deployed in the Gulf as part of a US-led naval force to support the UN </p>
<p>arms embargo and controls on the export of oil through the Gulf.</p>
<p>Section 1.1 also describes activity by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in support of the No-Fly </p>
<p>Zones in the North and South of Iraq. </p>
<p>A minute describing a briefing provided to Mr Blair by the Permanent Joint Headquarters </p>
<p>(PJHQ) on 15 January 2003, recorded that a total of 2,200 individuals were deployed in </p>
<p>the Gulf at that time.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> UK forces included 18 combat aircraft, nine combat support aircraft, </p>
<p>a number of nuclear-powered submarines, two destroyers/frigates, five Mine Counter </p>
<p>Measure vessels, two survey vessels and one Auxiliary Oiler (for fuel). </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The MOD’s account and analysis of the operation published in July 2003, said:</p>
<p>“Our maritime contribution to the Coalition was the first to be announced, on </p>
<p>7 January 2003, and built on the standing Royal Navy presence in the Gulf. Naval </p>
<p>Task Group 2003, led by HMS ARK ROYAL, which was already due to sail that </p>
<p>month as a routine deployment to the Gulf and Asia/Pacific regions, was expanded </p>
<p>to a much larger force totalling some 9,000 personnel. It included submarines armed </p>
<p>with Tomahawk cruise missiles and a significant amphibious capability with the </p>
<p>helicopter carrier HMS OCEAN, Headquarters 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, </p>
<p>40 Commando and 42 Commando (some 4,000 personnel), and hospital facilities </p>
<p>in RFA [Royal Fleet Auxiliary] ARGUS. This was the largest amphibious force </p>
<p>deployed since 1982 [the Falklands campaign]. The Task Group would provide force </p>
<p>protection, and conduct mine countermeasures operations as well as providing vital </p>
<p>sea-based logistics in support of joint force operations on shore.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Between March and September 2003, a total of 38 vessels, including three </p>
<p>submarines, and 50 helicopters were deployed by the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>16. </b> In relation to ground forces, the MOD stated:</p>
<p>“On 20 January, the Defence Secretary announced the deployment of a major </p>
<p>ground force including Reservists, equipped with Challenger 2 tanks, Warrior </p>
<p>armoured infantry fighting vehicles, AS90 self-propelled guns, and a range of </p>
<p>helicopters. This force, which eventually totalled some 28,000, would be the </p>
<p>largest land force deployment since the Gulf Conflict in 1991 … At the beginning </p>
<p>of operations, 16 Air Assault Brigade represented about half the Coalition’s air </p>
<p>assault capability, and 7 Armoured Brigade provided a significant proportion of </p>
<p>its tank forces.”</p>
<p><b>17. </b> On 6 March 2003, because of a delay in deployment of the US 4th Infantry Division, </p>
<p>the MOD expected that 1st (UK) Armoured Division would provide nearly 30 percent of </p>
<p>available Coalition tanks in the early stages of the ground campaign.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>18. </b> The army deployment included elements from 38 different units.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>19. </b> Describing the deployment of the RAF, the MOD stated:</p>
<p>“The Royal Air Force already maintained a presence of some 25 aircraft and </p>
<p>1,000 personnel in the Gulf, flying sorties over Iraq to enforce the No-Fly Zones </p>
<p>and to restrict the regeneration of Iraqi air and Integrated Air Defence capabilities. </p>
<p>On 6 February the Defence Secretary announced that the RAF contribution would </p>
<p>be increased to around 100 fixed wing aircraft manned and supported by a further </p>

<p>7</p>
<p>7,000 personnel … In addition, the Joint Helicopter Command deployed more than </p>
<p>100 helicopters, including Puma and Chinook support helicopters.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, UK Air Contingent Commander in 2003, wrote:</p>
<p>“In all, the UK [RAF] contributed some 8,100 personnel, together with 113 fixed wing </p>
<p>and 27 rotary wing aircraft to the operation; these assets were distributed across </p>
<p>eight Deployed Operating Bases in seven countries.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>21. </b> ACM Torpy told the Inquiry that the air campaign had needed UK air-to-air refuelling </p>
<p>capability, and that the US had specifically requested airborne early warning aircraft </p>
<p>and air defence aircraft for the start of the campaign.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> It had also wanted air-launched </p>
<p>precision guided weapons.</p>
<p><b>Command and control</b></p>
<p><b>22. </b> Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff, was in overall command </p>
<p>of UK forces, but delegated Operational Command to Lieutenant General John Reith, </p>
<p>Chief of Joint Operations (CJO).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> Adm Boyce’s Directive to Lt Gen Reith is addressed </p>
<p>in Sections 6.2 and 6.5. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Lt Gen Reith, who remained in the UK, exercised command through PJHQ to </p>
<p>Air Marshal Brian Burridge, the UK National Contingent Commander (NCC). </p>
<p><b>24. </b> AM Burridge, who was collocated with CENTCOM in Qatar, provided the link within </p>
<p>the US command structure for the national direction of UK forces, to ensure that they </p>
<p>would only undertake specific missions approved by UK commanders. </p>
<p><b>Appointment of the UK National Contingent Commander</b></p>
<p>AM Burridge told the Inquiry that he was designated as the UK National Contingent </p>
<p>Commander (NCC) in October 2002.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In December 2002, both AM Burridge and Gen Franks deployed their headquarters to </p>
<p>Qatar in preparation for Exercise Internal Look.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> AM Burridge told the Inquiry that his </p>
<p>headquarters consisted of “about 240 people”. </p>
<p>On 14 March 2003, Adm Boyce told Mr Hoon, that AM Burridge’s role was “to provide </p>
<p>a link for national political control of the employment of British Forces”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Adm Boyce wrote that, in Qatar:</p>
<p>“… the NCC co-ordinates the activities of UK forces in theatre to ensure they are </p>
<p>positioned and resourced to carry out approved tasks. He will also identify any </p>
<p>potential changes to the plan that may impact on UK forces, and seek approval for </p>
<p>any changes from the JC [Joint Commander]. If the UK forces are at any stage asked </p>
<p>to do anything that we would not wish them to, the NCC is empowered to intervene – </p>
<p>this is known as playing the red card”.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith issued a Directive to AM Burridge on 19 March which set out the relationship </p>
<p>between the CJO and NCC.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> That stated:</p>
<p>“I want a very clear understanding of the balance of responsibility between our </p>
<p>two headquarters. You are responsible for the integration of national effort into </p>
<p>the Coalition campaign. Your focus is to be forward and you are to act as my </p>
<p>representative in the CF HQ [Coalition Forces Headquarters]. In this regard, </p>
<p>I underscore the importance of ensuring a clear understanding of UK capabilities </p>
<p>and intentions within the Coalition and of monitoring closely, and influencing, US </p>
<p>planning as it develops. Within my intent and the powers delegated to you as the </p>
<p>National Contingent Commander, you have the lead in the direction of UK forces </p>
<p>in the execution of those tasks authorised by me. You are to keep me informed of </p>
<p>the situation in the JOA [Joint Operational Area], especially on developments that </p>
<p>may affect national political objectives or require changes to the ROE [Rules of </p>
<p>Engagement] or tasking of UK forces. My focus will be the OPCOM [Operational </p>
<p>Command] of the forces deployed and the definition of the national effort to be made </p>
<p>available to the Coalition campaign. Proposals for change to the agreed tasks of the </p>
<p>joint force will be authorised and resourced by me, informed by your understanding </p>
<p>of Coalition intent and your early identification of possible branch plans. In this </p>
<p>I shall be working closely with the MOD and the three single Services.”</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Three UK “Contingent Commanders”, Land, Air and Maritime, operated under </p>
<p>the national command of AM Burridge and the tactical control of US Component </p>
<p>Commanders “reflecting many years of NATO interaction and recent bilateral experience </p>
<p>in the Gulf region”.</p>

<p>The 1st Marine Expeditionary Force – divided into reinforced Regimental combat </p>
<p>teams – would follow the road network along the Tigris River, farther east. The Army </p>
<p>and Marines would link up to destroy any surviving Republican Guard units south </p>
<p>of the capital. The 4th Infantry Division would advance south from staging areas </p>
<p>in Turkey, provided we could persuade the Turks to lend us their territory for a few </p>
<p>months. A division-plus-size British ground force would pivot northeast out of Kuwait </p>
<p>and isolate Basra, forming a protective cordon around the southern oil fields. And </p>
<p>US, Brit and Australian Special Operations Forces would control Iraq’s western </p>
<p>desert, preventing the regime freedom of action to launch long-range missiles </p>
<p>toward Jordan and Israel.”</p>
<p><b>33. </b> The plan had four “Phases”, described by Gen Franks as: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase I – Preparation; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase II – Shape the Battlespace;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase III – Decisive Operations; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IV – Post-Hostility Operations.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> Phase I included establishing an “air bridge” to transport forces into the region, and </p>
<p>securing “regional and international support for operations”. During Phase II, separate </p>
<p>air operations would begin, intended to “shape the battlespace” before the start of </p>
<p>ground operations. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Gen Franks wrote that during Phase II the US would “launch air and Special </p>
<p>Operations Forces into Iraq … to destroy key target sets and set conditions for deploying </p>
<p>heavy units”.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Special Operations forces would deploy to destroy Iraqi observation posts along the </p>
<p>western border and seize control of potential missile-launching sites – “Scud baskets” – </p>
<p>and airstrips in Iraq’s western desert.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Phase II of the plan also included dropping thousands of leaflets in the southern </p>
<p>No-Fly Zone warning Iraqi troops against the use of WMD and intended to prevent </p>
<p>sabotage of the oilfields.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> During Phase II, targets would not include Iraq’s electrical power grid, power </p>
<p>plants, transformer stations, pylons and electricity lines, so as to preserve the national </p>

<p><b>Information operations</b></p>
<p>Information operations were an integral part of the military plan. They were to be </p>
<p>“employed to create doubt and disaffection against the regime, aggressively undermining </p>
<p>its legitimacy”.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In its first account and analysis of the operation, published in July 2003, the MOD </p>
<p>described the information campaign as:</p>
<p>“… designed to influence the will of the Iraqi regime and the attitudes of ordinary </p>
<p>Iraqi people in support of overall campaign objectives. It also articulated the [UK] </p>
<p>Government’s strategy to our allies and partners, and others in the region and </p>
<p>elsewhere who were either non-aligned or opposed to Coalition policy on Iraq. </p>
<p>This multi-level approach, in conjunction with the US and other allies, required an </p>
<p>integrated, agile campaign based on open reporting and transparency. Most effort </p>
<p>was devoted to opinion forming media, including terrestrial television, the press, </p>
<p>satellite and cable bearers, Internet and interactive media and ultimately bulk </p>
<p>leaflet drops over Iraq itself.” </p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a subsequent report on lessons from the conflict, the MOD stated that media </p>
<p>infrastructure within Iraq was only targeted if there was “sufficient evidence that it was </p>
<p>being used by the Iraqi regime for command and control purposes”.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>One element of the information operations campaign was intended to “seek to persuade </p>
<p>Iraqi military units not to fight”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Adm Boyce told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“… part of the battle plan was that we got messages … to Iraqi formations that if </p>
<p>they did certain things and looked [in] the other direction, we would walk past them, </p>
<p>because … we saw – the importance of actually maintaining the Iraqi Army as </p>
<p>being the infrastructure to maintain sensible good order once the country had been </p>
<p>defeated and indeed also keeping professionals, such as people who subsequently </p>
<p>we have not been able to use who were Ba’athists, given the fact that everybody </p>
<p>had to be a Ba’athist to be a professional; you had to be a card-carrying member. </p>
<p>And also not trashing the joint, if I can use that expression.” </p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Mr Geoff Hoon, Defence Secretary from 1999 to 2005, told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… planning for what was described by the Americans as effects-based warfare </p>
<p>was very successful … quite quickly, large numbers of Iraqi soldiers … simply </p>
<p>went home.” </p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>39. </b> In Phase III of the plan, Gen Franks’ objective was to reach Baghdad as soon </p>

<p>12</p>
<p>Iraqi population and the early collapse of Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> Gen Franks </p>
<p>did not want to give Saddam Hussein the opportunity to muster an effective defence, </p>
<p>especially the use of WMD, or to create major environmental damage as he had in the </p>
<p>1991 Gulf Conflict. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> Major General Graham Binns, who commanded 7 Armoured Brigade, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry: </p>
<p>“General Franks’ view was that he wouldn’t enter any urban areas until he had to </p>
<p>and that he was prepared to block and bypass and isolate until he got to Baghdad.” </p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>41. </b> UK concerns about the Iraqi regime’s plans to defend Baghdad, and the implications </p>
<p>of having to fight through urban areas for control, are set out in Section 6.2.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> After “wargaming” the invasion plan, Gen Franks concluded that several phases </p>
<p>could be combined into a single simultaneous effort:</p>
<p>“… <i>five days</i> to position the final airbridge after the President made a decision to </p>
<p>launch the operation, <i>eleven days</i> to flow the final pieces of the ‘start force’, <i>sixteen </i></p>
<p><i>days</i> of combined air and special operations attacks against key targets, and a </p>
<p>total of <i>125 days</i> to complete the destruction of Iraqi forces and the removal of </p>
<p>the regime.” </p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>43. </b> In the event, Gen Franks adjusted the timing further as a result of intelligence which </p>
<p>suggested that preparations were being made to destroy the Rumaylah oilfields, so that </p>
<p>ground forces would enter Iraq after just 24 hours of air operations.</p>
<p><b>The UK’s planned role in offensive operations</b></p>
<p><b>44.  The military plan was approved on 14 March, including roles for 7 Armoured </b></p>
<p><b>Brigade and 16 Air Assault Brigade at an early stage of the operation.</b></p>
<p><b>45. </b> When Mr Blair agreed to the deployment of a large scale ground force on </p>
<p>17 January 2003 (see Section 6.2), it was envisaged that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>3 Commando Brigade and maritime and air forces would all have combat roles </p>
<p>in the initial stages of an invasion;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“approximately 10 days later”, the Divisional Headquarters and 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade would “relieve US forces in an area south of Basra and the Euphrates, </p>
<p>including the Rumaylah oilfields”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>7 Armoured Brigade “could protect the right flank of the US 1st Marine </p>
<p>Expeditionary Force as it advanced north”. That would “include securing Basra </p>
<p>International Airport and isolating (but not entering) Basra itself”.</p>

<p><b>46. </b> The roles which UK forces would play during combat operations were set out in </p>
<p>a letter from Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, on 11 March.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>47. </b> The UK role within the US plan was described as “crucial in all three operating </p>
<p>environments”. The role of UK Special Forces is described in a Box later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that the plan required 3 Commando Brigade to seize the oil </p>
<p>infrastructure on the al-Faw Peninsula in the early hours of the operation, by means of </p>
<p>a combination of amphibious and helicopter assault. The US 15th Marine Expeditionary </p>
<p>Unit (15 MEU) was placed under the command of HQ 3 Commando Brigade for the </p>
<p>operation to capture the port of Umm Qasr.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>49. </b> The Royal Navy was to deliver the amphibious forces and to ensure the safe transit </p>
<p>of personnel and equipment by sea. Mine Counter Measure (MCM) vessels were to </p>
<p>clear the approaches to Umm Qasr.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> UK submarines were tasked with delivering Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles </p>
<p>(TLAMs) for initial air strikes.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Royal Navy ships, embarked helicopters and RAF maritime patrol aircraft were </p>
<p>to maintain a “maritime blockade” of the Iraqi coast and provide force protection </p>
<p>against Iraqi and terrorist threats. MCM vessels were to clear mines from Iraqi ports </p>
<p>and waterways.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> The RAF was to deliver offensive air strikes and provide close air support to </p>
<p>Coalition, not just UK, forces. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> The plan also called for the RAF to provide air defence, air-to-air refuelling and </p>
<p>ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance) capabilities, </p>
<p>maritime patrol aircraft and transport and logistics support.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> The MOD’s account and analysis of the operation published in July 2003 described </p>
<p>the main tasks of the air campaign as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to neutralise the Iraqi air force and Integrated Air Defence system;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to conduct strategic attacks against regime targets;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to provide air support to Coalition land forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to deter and counter the threat from theatre ballistic missiles, especially </p>
<p>in the west of Iraq; and</p>

<p>to destroy the Republican Guard divisions.</p>

<p>including the port/city of Umm Qasr, the Rumaylah oilfields, the al-Faw Peninsula, and </p>
<p>the area around Basra.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> That was to permit 1 MEF to continue its advance north as </p>
<p>soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> 1 (UK) Div’s role was to isolate Basra and, if required, defeat Iraqi forces in the </p>
<p>vicinity. The plan did not, however, explicitly require UK forces to enter Basra. If the </p>
<p>environment was sufficiently permissive, UK forces would plan to enter Basra City to </p>
<p>restore or maintain stability.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> In his letter of 11 March, Mr Watkins informed Sir David that Lt Gen McKiernan </p>
<p>had “developed a plan that would expand the UK Area of Operations (UK AO) by </p>
<p>up to 150km up to and beyond al-Amara (but short of al-Kut)”. Mr Hoon judged that </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith:</p>
<p>“… should be authorised to expand the Phase III Area of Operations northwards </p>
<p>if that is required to achieve a satisfactory outcome to Phase III. The focus for UK </p>
<p>in Phase IV should, however, remain the South-Eastern Area of Operations as </p>
<p>currently understood.”</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The UK AO as understood at that time included most of Basra province and small </p>
<p>parts of Muthanna and Dhi Qar. </p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Watkins also identified other scenarios in which the UK land component could </p>
<p>provide additional combat power given “delays in the deployment of some US forces”. </p>
<p>Those included inserting a light force into central Iraq and armoured options in support </p>
<p>of the US “Main Effort” if the UK “could tip the balance”, although that would “require </p>
<p>US logistic and medical support” and a “benign” situation in the UK AO. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr Watkins advised that “to reinforce key gaps in US capability and facilitate a rapid </p>
<p>US advance” from the South, the UK could provide:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a chemical and biological warfare detection and decontamination capability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>specialist engineers; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>specialist bridging capabilities, in case Iraqi forces destroyed the bridge over </p>
<p>the Euphrates at Nasiriyah.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Mr Hoon’s view was that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirm the availability of those specialist capabilities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be “forward leaning” on extending the AO northwards, “provided that UK </p>
<p>commanders judge this sensible in circumstances at the time”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be prepared to “continue exploring options for reinforcing US forces at decisive </p>
<p>points … but without commitment at this stage”.</p>

<p><b>94. </b> Shortly before midnight on 19 March, the US informed Sir David Manning that there </p>
<p>was to be a change to the plan and US airstrikes would be launched at 0300 GMT on </p>
<p>20 March.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>95. </b> From 0230 GMT, targets in and around Baghdad were attacked by US aircraft </p>
<p>and TLAMs.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> The Iraqi response to the attacks included firing five surface-to-surface </p>
<p>missiles at Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>96. </b> General Richard Myers, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that:</p>
<p>“… we took advantage of a leadership target of opportunity in Baghdad. Specifically </p>
<p>we struck at one of the residences in south-eastern Baghdad, where we thought the </p>
<p>[Iraqi] leadership was congregated.” </p>
<p>59 </p>
<p><b>97. </b> Gen Franks described the intention of the attacks as “a true decapitation strike”; </p>
<p>“Killing Saddam Hussein and his two sons would cripple the regime.” </p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>98. </b> Gen Franks recorded in his memoir that by 0900 (local time) on 20 March, Special </p>
<p>Operations forces in the western desert controlled 25 percent of Iraq. Special Operations </p>
<p>forces in the North had “linked up with Kurdish Peshmerga guerrillas and were deployed </p>
<p>along the Green Line separating the Kurdish Autonomous Zone (KAZ) from the rest of </p>
<p>Iraq – helping fix the enemy divisions in the north”.</p>
<p><b>The launch of the main offensive</b></p>
<p><b>99.  The main invasion of Iraq began early on 20 March.</b></p>
<p><b>100. </b> Early on the morning of 20 March, US forces (15 MEU) crossed into Iraq and </p>
<p>seized the port area of Umm Qasr before heading north, encountering stiff resistance </p>
<p>but achieving all their critical objectives ahead of time.</p>

<p><b>101. </b> Adm Boyce informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 20 March that, “with reports </p>
<p>of the disintegration of Iraqi units in the South, the Coalition was ready for the possible </p>

<p>precisely at regime and military targets. Precision weapons would be used to minimise </p>
<p>civilian damage and casualties.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Mr Blair concluded that Saddam Hussein’s strategy would be to try to draw the </p>
<p>Coalition into the cities to maximise civilian casualties and generate a “clamour” for </p>
<p>military action to cease. “In extremis”, Saddam Hussein would probably use chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons, some of which it was believed were deployed with Iraqi forces.</p>
<p><b>104. </b> In their conversation at 1600 on 20 March, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed </p>
<p>the previous night’s events, the possibility of “catastrophic success” in the event of a </p>
<p>sudden “melt-down” of Saddam Hussein’s regime, followed by reprisals by locals against </p>
<p>the Ba’ath Party.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> They also discussed their planned meeting at Camp David. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> In a statement to the House of Commons that afternoon, Mr Hoon said:</p>
<p>“President Bush announced at 3.15 this morning on behalf of the Coalition that </p>
<p>operations had begun with attacks on selected targets of military importance. </p>
<p>Those attacks were carried out by Coalition aircraft and cruise missiles on more </p>
<p>than one target in the vicinity of Baghdad, following information relating to the </p>
<p>whereabouts of very senior members of the Iraqi leadership. Those leaders are at </p>
<p>the very heart of Iraq’s command and control system, responsible for directing Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction …</p>
<p>“In addition to those attacks, Coalition Forces yesterday carried out certain </p>
<p>preliminary operations against Iraqi artillery, surface-to-surface missiles, and air </p>
<p>defence systems … Those were prudent preparatory steps … designed to reduce </p>
<p>the threat to Coalition Forces in Kuwait …</p>
<p>“British forces are already engaged in certain military operations, although the </p>
<p>House will understand why I cannot give further details at this stage.” </p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Hoon warned that the Government would not provide a “running commentary” </p>
<p>on events during military operations, but oral statements would be made “as and when </p>
<p>necessary” and summaries would be placed in the Library of the House of Commons </p>
<p>and the Vote Office “as warranted by the day’s events”. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> In his statement, Mr Hoon said that he would place a copy of the Government’s </p>
<p>military campaign objectives in the Library of the House of Commons later that day. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> The document, which had been approved by Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General </p>
<p>(see Section 6.2), said that the UK’s overall objective for the military campaign was:</p>
<p>“… to create the conditions in which Iraq disarms in accordance with its obligations </p>
<p>under UNSCRs and remains so disarmed in the long term.” </p>

<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>109. </b> In aiming to achieve the objective as swiftly as possible, the document stated </p>
<p>that “every effort will be made to minimise civilian casualties and damage to essential </p>
<p>economic infrastructure, and to minimise and address adverse humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences”. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> The main tasks of the Coalition were identified as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>overcoming the resistance of Iraqi Security Forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>denying the Iraqi regime the use of WMD now and in the future;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removing the Iraqi regime, given its clear and unyielding refusal to comply with </p>
<p>the UN Security Council’s demands;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identifying and securing the sites where WMD and their means of delivery were </p>
<p>located;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>securing essential economic infrastructure, including for utilities and transport, </p>
<p>from sabotage and wilful destruction by Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deterring wider conflict both inside Iraq and in the region.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> The campaign objectives also included “immediate military priorities” in the wake </p>
<p>of hostilities. Those were to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide for the security of friendly forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contribute to the creation of a secure environment so that normal life could be </p>
<p>restored;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work in support of humanitarian organisations to mitigate the consequences of </p>
<p>the conflict, or provide relief directly where needed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work with the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission </p>
<p>(UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to rid Iraq of its </p>
<p>WMD; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>facilitate remedial action where environmental damage had occurred;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enable “the reconstruction and re-commissioning of essential infrastructure for </p>
<p>the political and economic development of Iraq, and the immediate benefit of the </p>
<p>Iraqi people”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lay plans for reforming the Iraqi Security Forces. </p>
<p><b>112. </b> The document said that “British military forces will withdraw as soon as </p>
<p>practicable”, and concluded by re-stating the end state for Iraq set out by Mr Straw in </p>
<p>his statement of 7 February. </p>
<p><b>113.  Royal Marines from 3 Commando Brigade landed on the al-Faw Peninsula </b></p>
<p><b>early on 21 March. </b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>114. </b> On 20 March, the deployment of UK 3 Commando Brigade was brought forward </p>
<p>from the evening of 21 March to 1900 on 20 March.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>115. </b> Royal Marines of 40 and 42 Commando launched assaults on the al-Faw </p>
<p>Peninsula during the night of 20/21 March.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Marines from 40 Commando were reported to be ashore on the al-Faw Peninsula </p>
<p>on the morning of 21 March.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>117.  The landings by the Royal Marines did not go entirely as planned. </b></p>
<p><b>118.  The risk that the beaches would be mined was not explicitly identified and </b></p>
<p><b>addressed, and does not seem to have been drawn to the attention of Mr Hoon.</b></p>
<p><b>119.  As Chief of the Defence Staff, that was Adm Boyce’s responsibility. </b></p>
<p><b>120. </b> The crash of a US helicopter carrying US and UK personnel in Kuwait resulted </p>
<p>in a temporary suspension of US Sea Knight flights, as weather conditions worsened, </p>
<p>delaying the deployment from 42 Commando by around six hours.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> The crash killed four </p>
<p>US aircrew and eight UK personnel.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>121. </b> The MOD’s <i>Lessons for the Future</i> report stated that, despite efforts “against the </p>
<p>clock” to clear a beach for landing the light armour, the risk was deemed to be too high </p>
<p>when the scale of mining became apparent. The vehicles had to be landed back in </p>
<p>Kuwait and eventually reached their positions “some 24 hours later”.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>122. </b> Lieutenant General Sir James Dutton, who commanded 3 Commando Brigade </p>
<p>from July 2002, told the Inquiry that the landings had not entirely gone to plan.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A decision had been made to abort the planned US hovercraft landing of the brigade’s </p>
<p>light, tracked armoured vehicles because the risk was considered to be too great. </p>
<p>The helicopter crash had delayed the arrival of 42 Commando by “about 10 to 12 hours”.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> The overnight report for 20/21 March prepared by staff in COBR for No.10 </p>
<p>recorded: “Overall, Coalition Forces have met slightly more resistance than anticipated, </p>
<p>and there is no evidence yet of widespread Iraqi capitulation.” </p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>124. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry that intelligence had “lost sight of the Special Republican </p>
<p>Guard” about two weeks before the invasion and that it later “transpired that they had </p>
<p>been broken down into small elements and placed within various brigades”.</p>

<p><b>125. </b> Gen Reith added that that had not really been a factor other than for 3 Commando </p>
<p>Brigade which had:</p>
<p>“… hit a couple of small pockets of resistance which were Special Republican </p>
<p>Guard.</p>
<p>“By and large … we were dealing with … conventional divisions … many of them </p>

<p><b>126. </b> The redeployment of elements of the Republican Guard to stiffen Iraqi defences </p>

<p><b>128. </b> The assessment of the operational risks from forces deployed in the South is set </p>
<p>out in the Box below. </p>
<p><b>Potential Iraqi opposition in southern Iraq</b></p>
<p>A JIC Assessment of 6 December 2002 considered Iraq’s options “during a coalition </p>
<p>ground attack”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> The Assessment described Iraq’s naval capability<b> </b>as “very limited”, but </p>
<p>said that it “could lay a credible minefield along the Iraqi coast”. It did not specifically </p>
<p>address Iraq’s potential response to an amphibious assault, including mining the beaches.</p>
<p>The campaign plan for Operation Desert Storm in 1991 did not involve amphibious landings.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>The advice to Mr Hoon and Mr Blair is set out in Section 6.1. </p>
<p>The MOD advice to Mr Hoon in December 2002 identified a potential threat to maritime </p>
<p>forces from Iraqi forces defending the al-Faw Peninsula, and stated that the US plan was </p>
<p>designed to prevent reinforcements being attempted. If reinforcement was attempted, </p>
<p>“Coalition Forces should be able to defeat it with ease”.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> There was no consideration of </p>
<p>the likelihood of Iraq mining the beaches to hamper an amphibious landing. </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, identified the need for an assessment </p>
<p>which set out the operational risks of the role proposed for the Royal Marine Commando </p>
<p>Group in a clear and balanced way.</p>
<p>79</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>A JIC Assessment of 29 January 2003 reported “continuing military defensive preparations, </p>
<p>including deployments and reinforcements of military units in the South, West and along </p>
<p>the border of the Kurdish autonomous zone” which appeared to be “directed against both </p>
<p>the threat of internal uprising and external attack”.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> That included “possibly 1,000 troops on </p>
<p>the al-Faw Peninsula, apparently in response to the Coalition build-up in Kuwait”. But Iraq’s </p>
<p>options for redeployment in the South were “limited”: “Any significant redeployment in the </p>
<p>South would risk triggering a Coalition attack by breaching the No-Drive Zone.” </p>
<p>On 19 February, the JIC assessed the situation in southern Iraq and what might happen </p>
<p>there before, during and after Coalition action.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi forces currently guarding southern Iraq are a relatively weak first line of </p>
<p>conventional defence. They face rapid defeat. There is little evidence so far that the </p>
<p>Iraqis are preparing for a hard-fought defence of Basra and other urban areas.”</p>
<p>The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 949 (1994) (see Section 1.1) prohibited the presence of the Republican </p>
<p>Guard in the South. Its absence and the weaknesses of the Regular Army meant </p>
<p>that the Iraqi forces guarding southern Iraq (III and IV Corps) were a relatively </p>
<p>weak first line of conventional defence which would “face rapid defeat in the face </p>
<p>of a massive military onslaught”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC knew “little about Iraqi plans for the defence of Basra”, but there was “as </p>
<p>yet no sign of preparations for a hard-fought defence of this or other urban centres </p>
<p>in southern Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime had “appointed his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid </p>
<p>[Chemical Ali] as regional commander of the southern sector … with authority </p>
<p>over all forces in the area. Iraq practice in the Iran/Iraq war suggests this would </p>
<p>include tactical control over CBW. Ali is a loyal member of Saddam’s inner circle. </p>
<p>He was a brutal Governor of occupied Kuwait in 1990–91. He also played a </p>
<p>leading role in suppressing the Shia uprising in 1991 and Kurdish rebels in the late </p>
<p>1980s (using chemical weapons against the Kurds). His appointment may reflect </p>
<p>an Iraqi leadership view that a particularly loyal and ruthless figure is needed to </p>
<p>take command in the South in a crisis, both to suppress the Shia and to maintain </p>
<p>discipline among the Iraqi forces.”</p>
<p>Southern Iraq was judged to be the most likely area for the first use of CBW against </p>
<p>Coalition Forces and the local population (see Section 4.3).</p>
<p><b>129. </b> The assessment of the risks posed by irregular forces is addressed later in </p>
<p>this Section.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> In a statement on 21 March, Mr Hoon reported on the operations overnight, </p>
<p>including the loss of UK personnel and the Royal Marine operations supported by </p>
<p>Royal Navy ships.</p>
<p>83</p>

<p>102 </p>
<p>Minutes, 28 March 2003, Chiefs of Staff meeting. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>The Inquiry has seen papers that indicate a review of the ‘Joint Targeting and Battle </p>
<p>Damage Assessment’<i> </i>policy paper was carried out in late April 2003, with the aim of </p>
<p>highlighting any differences between the theory of targeting and the realities of an </p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> Two main issues were identified: the ability to provide accurate and timely </p>
<p>BDAs and the difficulty in target clearance where UK strategic aims did not agree totally </p>
<p>with US strategic aims. </p>
<p>In his post-operation tour report, Major General Peter Wall, Chief of Staff to AM Burridge </p>
<p>during the invasion and subsequently Commander 1 (UK) Div, wrote:</p>
<p>“The conduct and co-ordination of BDA was poorly done throughout the operation. </p>
<p>BDA analysis from MEF [the US Marine Expeditionary Force] was at best 5 days too </p>
<p>late. Immediate BDA from pilots gave a general idea but was, invariably, inaccurate. </p>
<p>This meant that targets were re-engaged unnecessarily on many occasions, denying </p>
<p>assets elsewhere.” </p>
<p>104</p>
<p>In its report of lessons from the conflict, the MOD Directorate of Operational Capability </p>
<p>(DOC) identified that the different models and methods used by the US and UK to </p>
<p>estimate collateral damage had resulted in a divergence of policy which had produced </p>
<p>friction.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> It concluded that the UK needed to develop its policy to seek greater coherence </p>
<p>with the policies of potential allies, particularly the US. It also recommended that improved </p>
<p>tools were required for the assessment of collateral damage to enable rapid decisions; </p>
<p>and that compatibility with US systems should be a consideration. The Coalition BDA </p>
<p>process had not been able to cope with the scale of the task and the UK’s capacity </p>
<p>needed to be reviewed to ensure it matched the needs of a national operation. In addition, </p>
<p>it was based on damage not effect. That too should be reviewed for compatibility with the </p>
<p>concept of effects-based targeting. </p>
<p>Asked if there were any areas of improvement he would suggest, ACM Torpy told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“The only area which I think we could have done more with, and that is the </p>
<p>mechanisms by which we assessed collateral damage. One of my roles I saw </p>
<p>was making sure that our targeting process was aligned as closely as possible </p>
<p>with the US system, but where there were inevitably going to be differences, that </p>
<p>I sorted those out with Gen Moseley before the campaign started, and we tried </p>
<p>to find a mechanism for solving those problems. One of the issues was if the US </p>
<p>use a particular software system for working out collateral damage and we use a </p>
<p>different one that it comes out with slightly different answers. Ours is slightly more </p>
<p>conservative. I think more work in trying to align some of that methodology would </p>
<p>have been helpful.” </p>

<p>“The situation surrounding Iraq’s 51st Mechanised Infantry Division remains </p>
<p>confused. A lot of its equipment has been abandoned and its personnel have </p>

<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Mr Blair concluded that militia resistance in population centres did not appear </p>
<p>significant when set against the broad thrust of the campaign and the Coalition’s </p>
<p>achievements to date. The campaign was only 72 hours old and there was no case for </p>
<p>adjusting the presentational posture before it was known what pattern was developing </p>
<p>on the ground. </p>
<p><b>174. </b> By 24 March, UK forces controlled Basra Airport.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>175. </b> In preparation for a statement to Parliament by Mr Blair on 24 March, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Assistant Private Secretary provided a “note on military developments” which said:</p>
<p>“Pockets of resistance remain in the cities, particularly from hard-core regime </p>
<p>supporters … [The] city of Basra is surrounded, with airport in Coalition hands </p>
<p>(but significant resistance from hard-core regime supporters expected …).” </p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>176. </b> In his statement, Mr Blair re-stated the UK’s “central objectives” as “to remove </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein from power” and ensure that Iraq was disarmed.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> The military </p>
<p>campaign to achieve those objectives was being conducted deliberately in a way </p>
<p>that “minimises the suffering of ordinary Iraqi people” and “to safeguard the wealth </p>
<p>of the country for the future prosperity of the people”. That was why the Coalition </p>
<p>had not mounted a heavy bombing campaign before the land campaign, and why </p>
<p>the immediate actions of the land forces had been to secure oil installations, which </p>
<p>had been mined. Had the Coalition not “struck quickly, Iraq’s future wealth would even </p>
<p>now be burning away”. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Mr Blair said that the targets of the air campaign were the “infrastructure, command </p>
<p>and control of Saddam’s regime, not of the civilian population”. Water and electricity </p>
<p>supplies were “being spared” and there were “massive efforts to clear the lines of supply </p>
<p>for humanitarian aid”, although that was hindered by the presence of mines. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> In relation to the city of Basra, Mr Blair stated that the aim was to render it </p>
<p>“ineffective as a basis [sic] for military operations”. The city was “surrounded and cannot </p>
<p>be used as an Iraqi base”, but there were “pockets of Saddam’s most fiercely loyal </p>
<p>security services” in Basra who were “holding out”. They were “contained but still able to </p>
<p>inflict casualties … so we are proceeding with caution”. Basra Airport was “secure”.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Mr Blair also said that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Coalition objective in the desert in the West was “to prevent Saddam from </p>
<p>using it as a base for hostile external aggression”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the North, the objective was to “protect people in the Kurdish Autonomous </p>
<p>Zone, to secure the northern oilfields and to ensure that the North cannot </p>
<p>provide a base for Saddam’s resistance”. </p>

<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>25 to 27 March: an operational pause</b></p>
<p><b>188.  On 25 March, Mr Blair raised the need for a media campaign to convince the </b></p>
<p><b>Iraqi people that the regime would collapse with President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>189.  Concerns were also emerging about negative press reporting of the progress </b></p>
<p><b>of the campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>190.  A debate began about whether the fall of Basra should be given priority as a </b></p>
<p><b>way to contribute to the fall of the regime in Baghdad. </b></p>
<p><b>191. </b> Adm Boyce told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 25 March that overcoming the </p>
<p>resistance of Iraqi irregulars in az-Zubayr would provide a good indication of how Basra </p>
<p>should be tackled.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> The fall of Basra would send a strong message, particularly when </p>
<p>combined with efforts to provide humanitarian relief to its inhabitants. But the bad </p>
<p>weather was likely to slow the advance on Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>192. </b> A minute to Sir David Manning, reporting the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 25 March, </p>
<p>stated that the Royal Marines were patrolling Umm Qasr in berets but that:</p>
<p>“Basra remains a conundrum: the commander of 1[UK] Div [Maj Gen Brims] has </p>
<p>yet to decide how best to proceed but planning for a number of options continues. </p>
<p>Situation should be clarified over the next 24 hours.” </p>
<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>193. </b> The Chiefs of Staff also discussed media issues. The minutes record a view that: </p>
<p>“… reporting from journalists in theatre gave a rather bleak outlook. Consideration </p>
<p>would be given to providing military context briefs to the embedded press corps and, </p>
<p>separately, to the ‘talking heads’ and opinion formers in London.” </p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>194. </b> After the Chiefs’ discussion, Mr Ian Lee, MOD Director General Operational Policy, </p>
<p>wrote to Sir Kevin Tebbit and Adm Boyce, recording that he had pursued three themes </p>
<p>identified as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the balance in media reporting and the need for a media programme which did </p>
<p>not give the appearance that the Government was “rattled”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the information operations view of the “Basra/Baghdad relationship”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “targeting of dual use communication media facilities”.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>195. </b> On information operations (IO), Mr Lee stated:</p>
<p>“… we discussed the strategic IO significance of Basra. In sum, the IO advice was </p>
<p>that the road to Baghdad leads through Basra. Not only would satisfactory removal </p>
<p>of regime elements from Basra send a message to Baghdad, it would have the </p>
<p>beneficial side effect (NB not an objective) of pacifying the impatient media.”</p>

<p><b>197. </b> Mr Lee advised that a separate submission would address the targeting of </p>
<p>communications facilities.</p>
<p><b>198. </b> A manuscript comment by Sir Kevin Tebbit on Mr Lee’s advice said:</p>
<p>“Two points:</p>
<p>(a) </p>
<p>the need to put across the overall strategy and progress towards it, to avoid </p>
<p>excessive focus on tactical ‘pinprick’ setback …</p>
<p>(b) </p>
<p>the importance of ensuring that judgement about Basra v Baghdad </p>
<p>… should be based on military risk/benefit considerations rather than </p>
<p>feel under particular political pressure to strike a blow for exemplary </p>
<p>humanitarian, or other, reasons.” </p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to Sir David Manning on 25 March stating: </p>
<p>“It is planned to conduct attacks over the next few nights which are intended to </p>
<p>degrade Iraqi command and control. These may also have the consequence of </p>
<p>stopping some media facilities. It is important that any public statements on these </p>

<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“Southern Iraq is effectively under Coalition control although significant resistance </p>

<p>“7 Armoured Brigade dominates the Basra area and has defeated hard-core </p>

<p>There may be a trade-off between the effort that would be required to defeat </p>
<p>them and the need to maintain the tempo of the Coalition’s main effort (the push </p>
<p>northwards to Baghdad).</p>
<p>“… al-Faw Peninsula, Umm Qasr and the southern oilfields have been secured … </p>

<p>35</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Watkins sent a second letter later the same day in response to a request from </p>
<p>No.10 for advice about “how the Coalition intended to deal with Fedayeen and the </p>
<p>Medina Division [of the Republican Guard]”.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> The letter said: </p>
<p>“… there are a number of paramilitary or irregular forces operating in Iraq. We do </p>
<p>not know for certain which of these forces are putting up resistance in southern </p>
<p>Iraq. Reporting from theatre is using the term ‘Fedayeen’ as a generic term for </p>
<p>‘irregular’ resistance.</p>
<p>“… The success or otherwise of groups in Basra is likely to have a direct impact </p>
<p>on the way these forces operate in Baghdad …</p>
<p>“… Against the background of our overall objectives and of the regime’s options, </p>
<p>it is tempo – namely rapid advance on Baghdad – that must take priority … This </p>
<p>resistance does not threaten the Coalition’s overall control of southern Iraq or the </p>
<p>ultimate attainment of our objectives, but mopping it up is not a trivial task.</p>
<p>“The military handling of this challenge in and around Basra will be a matter for the </p>
<p>judgement of … Major General Robin Brims, and we are keen to not try to second </p>
<p>guess him here. At present, his focus is on gathering information on the strength </p>
<p>and dispositions of irregular forces within and around the city, whilst testing the </p>
<p>water with robust patrolling in nearby az-Zubayr. The outcome of these activities </p>
<p>will influence the decision on whether, when and how to confront the residual </p>
<p>opposition in Basra. It should be borne in mind that the key military objective </p>
<p>is to ‘screen’ Basra, to prevent Iraqi forces disrupting the US push northwards: </p>
<p>this is being achieved.”</p>
<p><b>202. </b> In relation to the Medina Division, the MOD commented that the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>could leave it, and other formations, where they were, “making them vulnerable to air </p>
<p>strikes and an armoured assault; or withdraw it into Baghdad”. The exact approach to </p>
<p>dealing with it would be a “matter for the US land commanders to decide”. The MOD </p>
<p>also pointed out that “the engagement of the Medina Division is only a prelude to the key </p>
<p>task of dealing with Baghdad itself”.</p>
<p><b>203. </b> A list of Iraq’s irregular forces and their roles was provided in an annex to </p>
<p>Mr Watkin’s letter:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Fedayeen Saddam:</b> a militia comprising approximately 11,500 active </p>
<p>personnel, controlled by Qusai Hussein. In the event of a Coalition attack, it </p>
<p>was expected to be used for internal security, including repression of civilian </p>
<p>uprisings. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Ba’ath Party militia: </b>although officially disbanded, the Ba’ath Party was </p>
<p>likely to call out members to form an ad hoc force to conduct security sweeps. </p>

<p>36</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Quds Force: </b>a militia with close links to the Ba’ath Party, resembling a </p>
<p>Home Guard. Tasked with defending cities and putting down internal unrest. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Mujahideen e Khalq (MEK):</b> an Iranian dissident group, used to support </p>
<p>internal security operations. Expected to fight with Saddam Hussein’s forces </p>
<p>during an invasion. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Directorate of General Security (DGS):</b> a 2,700-strong paramilitary force </p>
<p>used for investigating and acting on anti-state activities. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Directorate of General Intelligence (DGI):</b> a security organisation used </p>
<p>to monitor and suppress dissident activities. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI):</b> a group of military personnel </p>
<p>tasked with collecting and assessing military intelligence from abroad and with </p>
<p>providing security and counter-intelligence for the Iraqi armed forces. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Special Security Organisation (SSO):</b> a security service responsible for </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s security, for monitoring the activities and loyalty of other units </p>
<p>integral to the survival of the regime and with a key role in protection of CBW </p>
<p>assets. Members of the SSO were posted to all Republican Guard and army </p>
<p>units, tasked with shooting attempted deserters. </p>
<p><b>204. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush again on 25 March. They discussed the need </p>
<p>to prevent the Fedayeen establishing a foothold and to disrupt the regime’s ability to </p>
<p>communicate.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Blair commented that progress had been good, but noted the difficulty in </p>
<p>persuading the Iraqi public that the regime would in fact collapse and the effects of </p>
<p>disinformation such as allegations about the murder of prisoners of war. The Coalition </p>
<p>needed to find ways of communicating with the Iraqi public who found it hard to conceive </p>
<p>of the Iraqi regime being supplanted. Mr Blair stated that the UK and US did not want to </p>
<p>get “sucked into street fighting, where our forces would take casualties”. Normalisation </p>
<p>efforts, such as the British patrols in Umm Qasr, were significant, as would be the first </p>
<p>deliveries of humanitarian aid. </p>
<p><b>206. </b> Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, wrote </p>
<p>that Mr Blair had told President Bush:</p>
<p>“… there was a chance that the whole thing would collapse quickly like a pack of </p>
<p>cards, but we shouldn’t bank on it. There would be a lot of fighting, but eventually </p>
<p>people would notice change happening … and if we handled relations with the Iraqi </p>
<p>people well, change could come quickly.” </p>

<p>37</p>
<p><b>207. </b> In relation to a subsequent presentation and discussion on the military campaign in </p>
<p>the MOD, with the Chiefs of Staff and Lt Gen Reith, Mr Campbell added:</p>
<p>“… it was absolutely clear that this was going to be a lot tougher. Reith felt the US </p>
<p>had been excessively optimistic about the collapse of the regime. The hard core and </p>
<p>Fedayeen were absolutely up for it. TB asked about Baghdad. They said it would be </p>
<p>split into forty sectors … It would take several weeks, and there were lots of dangers </p>
<p>… at Basra … it was not yet clear the best way to proceed.</p>
<p>“The most important thing for TB was to communicate to the Iraqis that we should </p>
<p>see this through, that they would benefit from the fall of Saddam. But we should not </p>
<p>expect them to welcome with open arms, because they will find it hard to believe the </p>
<p>Saddam era is ending. We were doing OK with public opinion in our own country, </p>
<p>but we were nowhere in Iraq. Reith said we had to separate regime from people, </p>
<p>and that meant taking out his media … Back at Number 10, TB was clear that it </p>
<p>was going to take longer than anticipated. Shock and awe had not really happened. </p>
<p>So we had taken the political hit of a stupid piece of terminology, and then not </p>
<p>actually had the military benefits.” </p>
<p><b>208. </b> The COBR daily report on 25 March related “some concern about the humanitarian </p>
<p>situation in Basra where water and electricity supplies have been disrupted since Friday </p>
<p>[21 March]”.</p>

<p>“Elements of UK land force continue to test city/town fighting in az-Zubayr as </p>
<p>a precursor to decision on tactics with Basra …”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the tactics for the next 12 hours would be to: “Isolate the Iraqi irregular forces </p>
<p>from the civilian population in Basra”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>poor weather was having a significant effect on the campaign: helicopter flights </p>
<p>in Southern Iraq had been suspended again because of bad weather, hampering </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade remained in Rumaylah, and 3 Commando Brigade on the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment, an element of 16 Air Assault Brigade, </p>
<p>remained on standby for a planned operation to secure Qalat Sikar Air Base </p>

<p>136</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Looking forward to the next 12 hours, the MOD said that the UK would: “Maintain </p>

<p>enemy to capitulate.” </p>
<p><b>212. </b> The COBR update for the night of 25/26 March said that Coalition aircraft had </p>
<p>attacked state TV in Baghdad and the Ba’ath Party HQ in Basra overnight.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>213. </b> Mr Scarlett informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 26 March that the situation </p>
<p>inside Basra was unclear, although desertions from the Iraqi Regular Army and the </p>
<p>militias were on the increase.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Adm Boyce said that the operational pause in the main Coalition thrust towards </p>
<p>Baghdad, which coincided with the bad weather, would come to an end shortly.</p>
<p><b>215. </b> At their meeting on 26 March, the Chiefs of Staff were told that the position of </p>
<p>Basra continued to attract media attention.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> The beginnings of a civil uprising in Basra </p>
<p>had been reported, but its extent was unknown. Lt Gen Reith described the situation in </p>
<p>the vicinity of Basra as:</p>
<p>“… complex, and further complicated by the possibility that the Land Cdr [Lt Gen </p>
<p>McKiernan] might require 7 Arm[oure]d B[riga]de to deploy north to assist in the </p>
<p>battle for Baghdad. GOC 1 Div [Maj Gen Brims] assessed that UK forces could </p>
<p>not secure Basra without the support of a popular uprising inside the city …” </p>
<p><b>216. </b> Adm Boyce directed that: “Ministers would need to be apprised of the difficulties </p>
<p>surrounding the Basra issue.” </p>
<p><b>217. </b> Air Marshal Sir Joe French, the Chief of Defence Intelligence, said that Iraqi TV </p>

<p>Baghdad was the CFLCC and Coalition main effort. Reinforcements might be </p>

<p>and “risks unattended disaster in Basra”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1 (UK) Div had insufficient forces to guarantee success in Basra, and attempting </p>
<p>to take Basra by force would divide the Coalition effort.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Success in Basra would support an information operations “message to </p>
<p>Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr Lee did not advocate any particular course of action but stated that the key </p>
<p>question was: “When does political/media/humanitarian pressure (primarily on the UK) </p>

<p> In relation to the military campaign, they were: </p>
<p>“… use airpower more effectively; control Iraq’s media; take out communications; </p>
<p>show Basra in new hands with popular support; destroy Republican Guards </p>
<p>divisions; the strategy for Baghdad.” </p>
<p><b>224.  The JIC assessed on 26 March that the Iraqi regime was still in control </b></p>

<p><b>227. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote to Sir David Manning setting out the JIC’s conclusions, which </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regime tactics were always geared towards urban resistance as well as </p>
<p>large-scale conventional warfare. The regime has taken heart from its ability, </p>
<p>so far, to maintain command control and communications, the lack of a northern </p>
<p>front, and the propaganda advantages it derives from domestic (controlled) and </p>
<p>international media coverage of the war;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the regime has not yet been faced with visible Coalition successes which would </p>
<p>shake the foundations of its self-belief. The ‘shock’ of Coalition operations on the </p>
<p>Iraqis has been limited. Coalition Forces have deliberately bypassed population </p>
<p>centres, leaving the regime in control of urban areas. The regime’s command, </p>
<p>control and communications have been more resilient than either it or the </p>
<p>Coalition expected. The prospects for an early regime collapse have therefore </p>
<p>lessened;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi population is reacting cautiously in the face of the regime’s continued </p>
<p>security presence and its propaganda. The population fears that the Coalition </p>
<p>will not follow through on its initial operation and remove Saddam, leaving it </p>
<p>open to regime retribution for popular uprisings. The memory of 1991 is strong </p>

<p><b>228. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded: </p>
<p>“A key question was when the perception would begin to change that the regime </p>
<p>was in control. This could follow major success against a key support structure </p>

<p>as Basra …”</p>

<p>broad international agenda and to tackle the Middle East Peace Plan.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> Mr Blair gave </p>
<p>Mr Bush a note addressing those issues, which is described in Section 9.1. </p>
<p><b>233. </b> On the military operation in Iraq, Mr Blair emphasised the impact that the liberation </p>
<p>of Basra would have. It would “signify that we had broken the power of the paramilitaries, </p>
<p>and taken control of Iraq’s second city. This would have enormous resonance”. He did </p>
<p>not want to “second-guess the military commanders”, but there were “very strong </p>
<p>political attractions in liberating Basra for the signal it would send to the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Blair also told President Bush that he did not want his visit to Camp David to </p>
<p>focus primarily on a UN resolution to deal with post-conflict Iraq: “The time to debate this </p>
<p>would come when we had secured victory, and were in a position of strength”. </p>
<p><b>235. </b> The wider discussion is addressed in Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>236. </b> The COBR update sent to Sir David Manning on 27 March reported that a </p>
<p>perception of weak Coalition air attacks may have raised regime morale.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>update also reported the view of the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) that “there is little </p>
<p>prospect of a significant uprising [in Basra], until the local population is convinced of the </p>
<p>Coalition’s intent and capability to remove the regime”. The Red Crescent was active in </p>
<p>Basra. Poor weather in southern Iraq continued to hamper air operations and a number </p>
<p>of sorties were cancelled. </p>
<p><b>237.  In preparation for a discussion with colleagues about the significance </b></p>
<p><b>of Basra for the wider campaign strategy, Mr Hoon was advised that </b></p>
<p><b>Gen McKiernan’s focus was the fall of Baghdad.</b></p>
<p><b>238. </b> In a minute to Mr Hoon’s Private Office on 27 March for a meeting with “Cabinet </p>
<p>colleagues” that day, the Deputy Head of Policy/Operations at PJHQ provided advice </p>
<p>on the significance of Basra within the wider campaign strategy.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Hoon was advised that:</p>
<p>“… regime removal is at the heart of the Coalition’s objectives … The US campaign </p>
<p>plan identified Baghdad as the centre of gravity for achieving these, and our other </p>
<p>objectives. It has always been McKiernan’s … understanding that at some stage it </p>
<p>would be necessary to take Baghdad, and that the entry of an attacking division into </p>
<p>Baghdad would be a strategically decisive point in the campaign. The same cannot </p>
<p>be said of any other area (including Basra). Hence it has long been the US plan … </p>
<p>to advance north as rapidly as possible, and reach Baghdad in the shortest possible </p>
<p>time (around 12 days, according to Gen Franks …).”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>240. </b> The minute reported that the majority of Basra’s population were Shia Muslims, </p>
<p>and that there was “a potential for the population to rise up against the regime”. </p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>“We have always recognised that the local population would be wary of rising in this </p>
<p>way, given the experience of 1991.”</p>
<p><b>241. </b> The morale of the estimated 6,000 regular forces in Basra was assessed as “low”, </p>
<p>the morale of the 2,000 irregulars was not; as committed supporters of the regime, they </p>
<p>had “everything to lose”. Against that background: </p>
<p>“… GOC 1 (UK) Div’s [Maj Gen Brims’] intent … has been to defeat Iraqi forces in </p>
<p>the vicinity of Basra and his intent is to continue in this vein; to isolate Iraqi irregular </p>
<p>forces from the civilian population …</p>
<p>“This approach supports, and reflects, Gen McKiernans’ [sic] overall intent. While </p>
<p>he doesn’t underestimate the importance of Basra, his assessment is that the fall </p>
<p>of Baghdad guarantees the fall of Basra, but that the reverse is not likely. </p>
<p>“Fighting in an urban environment is complex, and GOC 1 (UK) Div does not have </p>
<p>the forces at his disposal to conduct a successful, opposed entry into Basra …</p>
<p>“Other than media reporting, there is no evidence that this approach is contributing </p>
<p>to a humanitarian catastrophe in Basra …”</p>
<p><b>242. </b> The Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq and Cabinet on 27 March were both chaired by </p>
<p>Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, in Mr Blair’s absence at Camp David.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Scarlett informed the Ad Hoc meeting of Iraqi perceptions that the regime’s grip </p>
<p>on the population still held.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Adm Boyce reported that the discovery of mines in the waterway to Umm Qasr </p>
<p>would delay the arrival of ships bringing humanitarian relief supplies.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, reported that the </p>
<p>humanitarian situation in Basra was improving because of the efforts of the International </p>
<p>Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Damage to the high voltage electricity supply by </p>
<p>the Coalition had affected the water system. There were lessons to be learned.</p>
<p><b>246. </b> At the meeting on 27 March, Cabinet paid tribute to the 22 servicemen who had </p>
<p>lost their lives in the conflict.</p>

<p><b>247. </b> Mr Hoon informed his colleagues that, against the objectives which had been set </p>

<p>43</p>
<p>all secured. The sooner the oil could flow again, the sooner the profits could be used </p>
<p>for the Iraqi people. The Iraqi regime had been successfully denied the use of its WMD. </p>
<p>Wider conflict inside Iraq and in the region had been deterred. The leading elements </p>
<p>of the US forces were about 60 miles south of Baghdad where they were likely to be </p>
<p>opposed by four divisions of the Iraqi Republican Guard. That confrontation would be a </p>
<p>crucial event in the military campaign. Baghdad and other centres of population needed </p>
<p>to be isolated so that totalitarian control was diminished. </p>
<p><b>248. </b> The regime’s brutal intimidation was deterring Iraqis from rising up. Nevertheless, </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had lost control of most of southern Iraq. Handling Basra, where there </p>
<p>was the potential for a popular uprising although it had so far been held in check by the </p>
<p>regime’s militia, could be a model for application in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Cabinet also discussed the humanitarian situation and the responsibility of the </p>
<p>military as the Occupying Power to provide humanitarian relief. Mr Gordon Brown, </p>
<p>the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that he was making available an additional </p>
<p>£120m for humanitarian relief and raising the allocation of funds for the conflict from </p>
<p>£1.75bn to £3bn. </p>
<p><b>250. </b> Later on 27 March, Mr Blair, Mr Straw, President Bush, Secretary Powell and </p>
<p>Dr Rice and others at Camp David participated in a video conference with Mr Hoon and </p>
<p>Adm Boyce in London and Mr Donald Rumsfeld (US Defense Secretary) and Gen Myers </p>
<p>in Washington.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> Mr Hoon described Basra as “a microcosm of the successes and </p>
<p>limitations of Coalition operations across the country”; “regime loyalists” remained in </p>
<p>control of key areas, intimidating the urban population. </p>
<p><b>251. </b> Mr Blair stated that seizing Basra could have a huge impact on the wider </p>
<p>campaign.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Adm Boyce had:</p>
<p>“… underlined the strategic dilemma: the fall of Basra would send an important </p>
<p>message of the beginnings of the collapse of the Saddam regime, but deploying </p>
<p>adequate forces to achieve this in the absence of a local uprising would divert from </p>
<p>the top objective of reaching Baghdad. Indeed there was a case for shifting forces </p>
<p>from Basra to reinforce the drive on Baghdad.” </p>

<p><b>253. </b> Following their meetings, Mr Blair and President Bush gave a joint press </p>
<p>conference.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> Mr Blair told reporters:</p>
<p>“Our forces are now within 50 miles of Baghdad. They have surrounded Basra, they </p>
<p>have secured the key port of Umm Qasr, they have paved the way for humanitarian </p>
<p>aid to flow into the country and they have brought real damage on Iraq’s command </p>
<p>and control. So we can be confident that the goals we have set ourselves will </p>
<p>be met.”</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Reporting on President Bush and Mr Blair’s press conference and the atmosphere </p>
<p>in Washington, the British Embassy commented that the “prospect of instant </p>
<p>victory/‘catastrophic success’ has vanished” but President Bush had reassured the </p>
<p>American public that victory was the only possible outcome “however long it takes”.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That “followed days of media speculation that the war plan was flawed, that the US had </p>
<p>too few troops on the ground, that the Iraqi resistance had taken the US by surprise”. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> The Embassy also commented that managing the media had been “a sharp </p>
<p>learning curve” for the US administration and that the press conference had been the </p>
<p>first occasion “for [Gen Myers] to articulate at one sitting the gains the Coalition has </p>
<p>made into hostile terrain”. </p>
<p><b>28 March: one week in</b></p>

<p><b>261. </b> Mr Hoon’s Assistant Private Secretary wrote on 28 March that Mr Hoon had “noted” </p>
<p>the advice from the PJHQ about the planning for Basra “and the continuing imperative </p>
<p>attached to operations in respect of Baghdad”.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> He was:</p>
<p>“… keen that we do not adopt a static approach to Basra, but instead actively exploit </p>
<p>the physical and information opportunities which are presented … </p>
<p>“Mr Hoon also wonders whether the balance would be changed if circumstances </p>
<p>dictated that the attack on Baghdad were delayed, say until after the arrival of </p>
<p>4th Infantry Division.” </p>
<p><b>262. </b> The Assistant Private Secretary also requested further advice for Mr Hoon on the </p>
<p>actions being taken by UK forces around Basra.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Operations around Basra were discussed at the Chiefs of Staff meeting on the </p>
<p>morning of 28 March.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> An air strike had been carried out on the Iraqi Intelligence HQ in </p>
<p>Basra. Separately, troops from the Black Watch had conducted a patrol 7km into Basra. </p>
<p>Operations were focused on “driving a wedge between the Iraqi forces and the wavering </p>
<p>civilian population”. </p>
<p><b>264. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were told that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade had been dispatched to secure Route 6, which ran north </p>
<p>from Basra, through al-Amara and al-Kut, to Baghdad. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The al-Faw Peninsula was “thought to be as secure as possible … Operations </p>
<p>had therefore transitioned to PSO – [peace support operations] type activity, </p>
<p>although the local population remained very cautious.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>3 Commando Brigade continued to destroy enemy assets on the peninsula. </p>
<p>CENTCOM guidance had been changed “to include destruction of Regime </p>
<p>loyalists and symbols … to demonstrate commitment to the Iraqi people …” </p>

<p>46</p>
<p><b>267. </b> The<i> New York Times</i> reported that bad weather and fierce fighting were slowing </p>
<p>the attack, and that the supply train had yet to catch up with the US forces 100 miles </p>
<p>from Baghdad, leading to concerns about food, fuel and water. </p>
<p><b>268. </b> On 28 March, Mr Adam Ingram, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, and </p>
<p>General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, held their first press conference </p>
<p>since the start of military action.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Mr Ingram told reporters that: </p>
<p>“In a remarkably short time the Coalition and the UK presence within it have </p>
<p>accomplished an extraordinary amount … The Iraqis are simply no match for them.”</p>
<p><b>270. </b> In response to a question about the percentage of the UK Armed Forces committed </p>
<p>to operations, Mr Ingram replied that, across all three Services, about a quarter were in </p>
<p>the Gulf. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> In his statement, Gen Jackson responded to reporting that the campaign was </p>
<p>“bogged down”, by saying that he “wouldn’t actually describe it that way”. “Bogged </p>
<p>down” was, in his view, a “tendentious phrase” for “a pause whilst people get themselves </p>
<p>sorted out for what comes next”.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Gen Jackson stated that 3 Commando Brigade was in control of the al-Faw </p>
<p>Peninsula, 16 Air Assault Brigade continued to secure and control the Rumaylah </p>
<p>oilfields, and there had been some “highly successful” engagements around Basra. </p>
<p>Iraqi forces in the South were “fixed – by that we mean they are pinned down, their </p>
<p>ability to manoeuvre is … very little indeed”. He also paid tribute to the “staggering </p>
<p>achievement” of the logisticians who had made it all possible; that was “better even than </p>
<p>what was achieved in the first Gulf War”.</p>
<p><b>273. </b> Gen Jackson said: </p>
<p>“It is inevitable that there is a demand for rapid results, but we must be very careful </p>
<p>that what is hoped … does not come to some sort of prediction … it is not a fixed </p>
<p>plan … [as] the President of the United States and our own Prime Minister said </p>
<p>yesterday … it will take as long as it takes to achieve the objective.”</p>
<p><b>274. </b> Asked about the idea that Iraq’s “dogged resistance” was “ruining” the Coalition’s </p>
<p>plan, Gen Jackson stated that the plan had not changed, but the enemy would try </p>
<p>to interfere with it. At the tactical level, plans would be adjusted according to the </p>
<p>local situation. </p>

<p>47</p>
<p><b>275. </b> When Lt Gen Wallace’s comments were put to him, Gen Jackson said that the Iraqi </p>
<p>irregular forces were regime supporters who were resisting because they had “nowhere </p>
<p>else to go, their futures were pretty limited”. </p>
<p><b>276. </b> Reporting on the first week of the campaign, the British Embassy Washington </p>
<p>wrote on 29 March that President Bush was “irritated by suggestions that the war plan </p>
<p>has gone awry”.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> He was taking steps to manage that by giving “Americans the big </p>
<p>picture”. As a result, the Embassy noted that the Administration was increasingly willing </p>
<p>to “take the gloves off” in its conduct of the campaign. </p>
<p><b>277. </b> AM Burridge commented in his end of tour report that in the first week the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime “had maintained a surprisingly effective hold on media activity, arguably winning </p>
<p>the early Information Operations (IO) battle”.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Lt Gen Brims told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… we did expect irregular forces in their various ways and they probably fought </p>
<p>more voluminously and venomously than we had anticipated …” </p>
<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>279. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations (Operations) </p>
<p>during the invasion, told the Inquiry that, one week in, UK forces had “found ourselves </p>
<p>confronting … Iraqi conventional forces but also feeling … enveloped on our own rear </p>
<p>areas by Iraqi irregulars … It represented a dimension that we hadn’t expected to find </p>
<p>at that stage.” </p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that the speed of advance left rear troops more vulnerable </p>

<p>place early on 28 March.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> Maj Gen Wall had briefed the US “on the UK strategy in </p>

<p>The Coalition “needed a victory soon”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The battle for Baghdad could not commence with Basra and the South so </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“The absence of a popular reaction against them [Saddam Hussein’s regime]” </p>
<p>was “eroding support for the campaign internationally”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Impatience would have risks; the UK needed to hold its nerve. </p>

<p><b>284. </b> On 28 March, in a brief “intended to provoke thought rather than to provide </p>
<p>authoritative assessment”, the DIS Red Team (see Section 6.5) raised the possibility that </p>
<p>the Coalition had not fully appreciated the implications of Saddam Hussein’s asymmetric </p>
<p>tactics, and specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>urban guerrilla warfare;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>irregular warfare against lines of communication;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>threat of chemical, biological and missile attack; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the willingness of the regime to breach international humanitarian law </p>
<p>obligations.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Irregular warfare against the Coalition’s lines of communication had caused delay </p>
<p>and casualties, and created the risk of Coalition over-reaction. While the Iraq regime </p>
<p>was still in place, Iraqis would “fear the consequences of betraying the regime more than </p>
<p>they support Coalition Forces”. That had been “unwittingly supported by the Coalition </p>
<p>information campaign, which has encouraged Iraqis to stay at home”. </p>
<p><b>29 to 31 March: events</b></p>

<p>in the South continued to consolidate their hold.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>288. </b> Mr Hoon said it would be helpful if aid agencies and others could be encouraged </p>
<p>to return to the South to distribute aid. That would release troops from the task.</p>
<p><b>289. </b> There is no reference in the record of the meeting to any discussion of the options </p>
<p>for Basra.</p>
<p><b>290. </b> Just after midday on 29 March, Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice, who told him </p>
<p>that Gen Franks was preparing for a major battle or “denouement” south of Baghdad.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She said that Gen Franks would move when ready, probably within a few days. </p>
<p><b>291. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice discussed media comments in the US and UK that the </p>
<p>campaign was ill-prepared and had become “bogged down”. Sir David said:</p>
<p>“It was worth reminding people that we were only in week two of the war; and that </p>
<p>we were dealing with a population that had been traumatised by years of repression </p>
<p>and where people were in fear of their lives. When we took control of urban centres, </p>
<p>and it became clear that Saddam was really finished, people would be more likely </p>
<p>to lose their fear and speak out about Saddam and the horrors they had endured.”</p>
<p><b>292. </b> The Red Team produced another report on 29 March, again intended to “provoke </p>
<p>thought rather than to provide authoritative assessment”, which analysed Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s likely survival strategy.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“We need a focus for our information operations … the best focus would be Basra </p>
<p>under Coalition control, with an effective humanitarian operation in train and plenty </p>
<p>of exploitation of recent atrocities. This would have a real impact on his level of </p>

<p>Coalition main effort.”</p>

<p>29/30 March.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> 7 Armoured Brigade had conducted raids on “opportunity targets” in </p>
<p>Basra, “taking advantage of a growing perception that the city was ‘opening up’ to the </p>

<p>50</p>
<p><b>295. </b> On 30 March, Sir David Manning sent a minute to Mr Blair setting out his thoughts </p>
<p>10 days into the conflict, “for what they are worth”.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> He wrote: </p>
<p>“As you said at Camp David, much has been achieved. We need to keep our nerve. </p>
<p>But we also need to accept that the war is not working out as advertised, and adjust </p>
<p>accordingly.</p>
<p>“Saddam is apparently still in place; and the Iraqis are fighting effectively. This </p>
<p>is not the war the military expected. We need a strategy for dealing with the </p>
<p>Fedayeen phenomenon. CDS says Franks will take these units out one by one. But </p>
<p>how does he intend to identify them? … We [the Coalition] are also short of men […] </p>
<p>We now have thousands of troops still on their way through the Red Sea [the US 4th </p>
<p>Infantry Division].”</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Addressing the risks as he saw them, Sir David wrote: </p>
<p>“Franks will launch his delayed and much hyped Army Group offensive later this </p>
<p>week. But what sort of offensive will it be if the Iraqis refuse the roles allocated to </p>
<p>them …? Will pulverising attacks be possible on the Medina and Baghdad Divisions </p>
<p>if they avoid fighting in massed units in the open, instead concentrating in heavily </p>
<p>populated, built up areas? </p>
<p>“Franks’ focus remains Baghdad. Whatever the outcome of the imminent offensive, </p>
<p>he [General Franks] seems determined to deliver the prize [Baghdad] to Bush and </p>
<p>Rumsfeld within four to six weeks … The plan to divide Baghdad into forty or fifty </p>
<p>sectors and clear them out one by one could turn into a nightmare and give Saddam </p>
<p>his Stalingrad. I think you should demand an early review of this strategy. I think it </p>
<p>risks losing us the war rather than winning it.”</p>
<p><b>297. </b> Addressing the military priorities, Sir David advised:</p>
<p>“All this makes me think we should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ask the military for a detailed account of how they will now adapt the </p>
<p>campaign to the Iraqi guerrilla war of hit and run;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ask for a detailed analysis of Franks’ planned big offensive … How severe </p>
<p>will collateral damage be if the Medina and Baghdad Divisions are in </p>
<p>urban areas?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>put plans for Baghdad on hold, while we focus on Basra. We should reject </p>
<p>the argument that if Baghdad falls so will Basra but that the reverse does not </p>
<p>apply … Baghdad is unlikely to fall quickly. But Basra might. Success there </p>
<p>would send shock waves through the Iraqi system that could destabilise the </p>
<p>regime. This could in turn give us a better chance of taking Baghdad with </p>
<p>minimum loss of life. The question is whether it now makes sense for the </p>

<p>51</p>
<p>Americans to move forces to Basra rather than for us to withdraw our armour </p>
<p>from the city and send it north.”</p>
<p><b>298. </b> Sir David concluded his minute by considering the political strategy. He advised </p>
<p>Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“Things may be better than I think […] But the ‘denouement’ that Condi [Rice] talked </p>
<p>to me about yesterday still feels a long way off. We are at a critical moment: we </p>
<p>need a ‘Mazar-e-Sharif’ turning point. We need to ensure that the military campaign </p>
<p>is the means of winning the political argument. Our best chance is to concentrate </p>
<p>on taking Basra in the next few days and weeks, and on pacifying the Shia South. </p>
<p>With the oil wells working and humanitarian relief in place, we will be able to show </p>
<p>that we have liberated an area and that life is steadily improving. People will then </p>
<p>lose their fear and speak out. This will help to transform the media coverage. </p>
<p>“While we concentrate on Basra, we should get more forces into the North as quickly </p>
<p>as possible … Between these southern and northern millstones, we should patiently </p>
<p>work against Saddam in Central Iraq. We should move to surround Baghdad, but </p>
<p>not move to assault it unless we are very confident that it is ready to fall. Otherwise </p>
<p>the military cost will be heavy and the loss of life will be great. Success at this price </p>
<p>could well be politically unsustainable.”</p>
<p><b>299.  The MOD continued to advise Mr Hoon that the US military did not see Basra </b></p>
<p><b>as strategically significant.</b></p>
<p><b>300.  The US attached a higher priority to the UK role in providing security for the </b></p>
<p><b>oilfields, protecting lines of communication and in the retention of Umm Qasr. </b></p>
<p><b>301.  The US military would be unlikely to review the position until after a planned </b></p>
<p><b>major engagement with Republican Guard forces, which might not take place for </b></p>

<p>176</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>304. </b> Mr Johnson wrote:</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Judge the main priorities for 1 (UK) Div as being the maintenance of control </p>
<p>over the southern oilfields, the security of the lines of communication and the </p>
<p>retention of Umm Qasr;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Would not currently be prepared to provide additional forces for operations </p>
<p>to secure entry into Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Are unlikely to review their position until after the planned major engagement </p>
<p>with Republican Guard forces, which may not take place for several days.”</p>
<p><b>305. </b> Mr Johnson added that 1 (UK) Div was implementing “a proactive strategy </p>
<p>to develop Coalition control over Basra … conditioned by the need to avoid large </p>
<p>UK or civilian casualties”. Iraq was thought to be reinforcing Basra. Progress would </p>
<p>be “determined by effects and events rather than a set timetable”. There was </p>
<p>“no indication that the US are contemplating any change in strategy”.</p>
<p><b>306. </b> In the detailed portion of his advice, Mr Johnson stated that US commanders </p>
<p>did not see the fall of Basra as “a high operational priority”.</p>
<p><b>307. </b> The “security of the line of communication – under continual attack from Iraqi </p>
<p>irregulars – and the associated preparation of … front line forces … the key enablers </p>
<p>for the launch of decisive operations against Republican Guard forces, and thereafter </p>
<p>Baghdad” were Lt Gen McKiernan’s priorities.</p>
<p><b>308. </b> The US also did not see Basra as “the main effort for British Forces. They </p>
<p>attach a higher priority to the continued security of the southern oilfields, their lines </p>
<p>of communication, and to the retention of Umm Qasr.” </p>
<p><b>309. </b> In relation to the UK’s strategy for Basra, Maj Gen Brims was “continuing with </p>
<p>constant, aggressive activity in and around Basra”. His aims were to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“divide the Iraqi irregulars from the regime in Baghdad and the civilian population </p>
<p>in Basra and az-Zubayr …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“encourage any popular uprisings that might enable British forces to enter and </p>
<p>take control of the cities, with acceptable risk.” </p>
<p><b>310. </b> Maj Gen Brims had assessed that:</p>
<p>“… even if he wanted to at this stage – it would be extremely difficult and highly risky </p>
<p>to attempt to enter Basra whilst the irregulars remained well organised and while </p>
<p>the population are only supporting the Coalition passively at best. To compensate </p>
<p>for these factors he would have to resort to attritional tactics relying on heavy </p>
<p>firepower. This would guarantee significant casualties – both British and civilians – </p>
<p>and widespread damage to infrastructure, both of which could only have a negative </p>
<p>impact on domestic and international support, and on Iraqi perceptions of the UK </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>both in the short term and in the aftermath. Commander 1 (UK) Div is also conscious </p>
<p>of the continuing threat posed by Iraqi forces within missile range of Basra … And </p>
<p>most importantly, entry to Basra is a decision for the Coalition land commander, and </p>
<p>is not Commander 1 (UK) Div’s call.”</p>
<p><b>311. </b> Mr Johnson also set out the specific actions being undertaken by UK forces, </p>
<p>including to: “Isolate the community from regime propaganda and replace it with our own </p>
<p>information.” Radio broadcasts were being used to convey messages, including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“unlike 1991, we will not stop until we have overcome this resistance and </p>
<p>overthrown the regime”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“we will enter Basra when the time is right”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“we will work to relieve the population’s hardship when we do enter”.</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Mr Johnson wrote that it was “important to ensure we do not undermine our </p>
<p>credibility by making promises we cannot fulfil”.</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Mr Johnson described the raids and attacks at the heart of the UK approach in </p>
<p>Basra. They included a raid on the State Security Organisation in az-Zubayr, an air strike </p>
<p>on the Intelligence headquarters in Basra and a raid into Basra which attacked the TV </p>
<p>station and destroyed two statues of Saddam Hussein. A “further encroachment” into </p>
<p>the outskirts of Basra was in progress as Mr Johnson wrote his advice, focused on the </p>
<p>Abu Al Khasib area to the southeast of Basra. </p>
<p><b>314. </b> In the event of “the situation in Basra disintegrating into chaos”, Mr Johnson </p>
<p>told Mr Hoon that Maj Gen Brims had developed contingency plans. They included </p>
<p>leaving a route to the north open “to enable irregular forces to leave – he has troops </p>
<p>positioned further north who would engage them at a safe distance from Basra itself – </p>
<p>and to forestall accusations that he is laying siege to the city”. He was also prepared </p>
<p>to facilitate access for the delivery of humanitarian aid and repairs to key infrastructure </p>
<p>as necessary; and to deploy 7 Armoured Brigade into the city with tanks. </p>
<p><b>315. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to Mr Hoon on 31 March with “Some personal thoughts </p>
<p>about handling the wider [political/military] issues of the campaign.” </p>
<p>177</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>316. </b> In the context of US/UK relations, Sir Kevin cautioned:</p>
<p>“… we need to take some care to avoid a situation where the US is focused on </p>
<p>Baghdad and the UK regards the ‘exemplar’ of Basra as its own contribution. I found </p>
<p>David Johnson’s note of 30 March instructive in this respect where he reminds us of </p>
<p>what US overall strategy is and that ‘entry into Basra is a decision for the Coalition </p>
<p>Land [Coalition Forces Land Component] Commander, [Lt] Gen McKiernan, and </p>
<p>is not Commander 1 (UK) Div’s call’. We tend, perhaps because of the way we get </p>
<p>our twice daily briefings from PJHQ, to assume that this is a UK lead. We should </p>

<p><b>320. </b> Following the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 31 March, a Cabinet Office official told </p>
<p>Sir David Manning that:</p>
<p>“There appears to be an increasing doctrinal difference between ourselves and </p>
<p>the Americans over our approach to dealing with the Iraqi towns and cities. </p>
<p>The Americans are very much in post 9/11 mode for dealing with the undecided: </p>
<p>if you are not for us then you must be against us. Our approach has been to </p>
<p>seduce … the undecided and encourage them to rise up. This is a message that </p>

<p> </p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>321. </b> The official wrote that in Basra:</p>

<p>that we really meant to liberate them, and would come over to us.” </p>
<p><b>325. </b> Dr Rice said that “the Fedayeen phenomenon” had been underestimated, but that </p>
<p>Gen Franks was quickly adjusting his tactics in response. </p>
<p><b>326. </b> In briefing for a discussion between Mr Blair and President Bush at lunchtime on </p>
<p>31 March, Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised </p>
<p>that, in relation to the military campaign: </p>
<p>“You said you wanted to cover … consequences of an incremental approach. </p>
<p>Including in the media campaign. Need for strategic grip.” </p>
<p>181</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>327. </b> The discussion between Mr Blair and President Bush recognised that the </p>
<p>advance on Baghdad had slowed to give the air campaign more time to “soften up” </p>
<p>the Republican Guard.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> Mr Blair was concerned that the “Basra scenario” could be </p>
<p>repeated in Baghdad with a small, pro-regime force in a large built-up area which was </p>
<p>“difficult for us to get at without risk of high civilian casualties”. In such circumstances, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated that winning the “propaganda war” would be even more important. </p>
<p>Persistent attacks on pro-regime forces coupled with efforts to “win over the locals” </p>
<p>would eventually reach a tipping point, but that could take weeks to develop. There was </p>
<p>a need to tighten up media handling and drive the news agenda. Mr Blair suggested </p>
<p>that, as for the Kosovo campaign, the US and UK “needed an election-style media </p>
<p>‘war-room’”. During the “steady advance” phase, propaganda and politics would be </p>
<p>inextricably linked. A clearer picture was needed of the shape of a post-Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>Iraq to “sketch out a political and economic future and dispel the myth that we were out </p>
<p>to grab Iraq’s oil. But our promises had to be realistic”.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Following the discussion, Mr Blair sent President Bush two Notes. </p>

<p>to present a coherent strategy. The nature of the Iraqi regime had to be exposed and the </p>

<p>and human rights protection had to be conveyed to the Iraqi people and more widely. </p>
<p>Resources and the full co-operation of government departments would be needed </p>

<p>Republican Guard divisions outside Baghdad would fall back into the city or remain </p>
<p>outside. UK forces continued to chip away at Basra, where resistance by Iraqi regulars </p>
<p>was diminishing. More generally, the main judgement to be made at the end of the </p>
<p>conflict would be whether life was better for the Iraqis. This was what would count for </p>
<p>Arab opinion in particular. Our message to the Iraqi people needed to be repeated so </p>
<p>that there was no doubt about our intentions. Mr Blair repeated that the full co-operation </p>

<p>the RA [Regular Army] have attacked Ba’ath officials […] UK forces have been </p>
<p>approached by a member of the RA who stated that elements of the RA will </p>
<p>conduct attacks on regime forces once the Coalition moves to take the city.</p>
<p>Local population </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is a body of evidence that there may have been an attempted uprising on </p>
<p>25 March. This was put down by the regime, with local tribal leaders summarily </p>
<p>executed. Civilians are now too frightened to move against [the] regime. There </p>
<p>are multiple reports stating that regime forces have also used mortars and </p>
<p>automatic weapons to attack civilians trying to leave the city.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… as families leave, elements of the male population seem to be more confident </p>
<p>to challenge the regime. As Coalition attacks … are increasingly successful, </p>
<p>anti-regime sentiments are getting stronger.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There are difficulties with supporting anti-regime forces … the Coalition will not </p>
<p>be able to differentiate between resistance fighters and regime security forces.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>355. </b> The points made by Mr Scarlett included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The intelligence was “often unclear or unreliable” about which organisation was </p>
<p>involved in particular events, and the “distinction between these organisations” </p>
<p>might break down “particularly in confused situations eg currently in Basra, </p>
<p>Nasiriyah and Najaf”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Before the conflict, each of Iraq’s 18 Governorates had had “one Fedayeen </p>
<p>battalion and one or two ‘emergency forces’ battalions … of Ba’ath Party militia </p>
<p>and intelligence/security forces (with each battalion up to 1,500 men)”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Estimates of the total strength of the Fedayeen varied from “15–40,000 </p>
<p>members”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The irregular forces were motivated by a range of factors and they were difficult </p>
<p>to identify. They did “not need to be particularly militarily effective to cause the </p>
<p>Coalition problems politically or to increase Coalition requirements for force </p>
<p>protection”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “survival of communications links with Baghdad and the central Iraqi </p>
<p>leadership” was “of pivotal importance to the continued resistance by the </p>
<p>irregular forces”; “maintaining the implicit threat of retribution against those </p>
<p>who do not fight and undermining any perception of Coalition success”. </p>
<p><b>356. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded:</p>
<p>“… it remains possible that even without effective command and control … some </p>
<p>irregulars would fight on … </p>
<p>“Although there is little specific intelligence, we must be ready for new guerrilla-style </p>
<p>activity and tactics … It is possible that Iraq now will have established plans for </p>
<p>a ‘stay-behind’ network of fighters and supplies to harass Coalition Forces and </p>
<p>the population in areas supposedly cleared of fighters … The irregulars will also </p>
<p>continue to take advantage of any opportunity to infiltrate across the front line into </p>
<p>the Coalition rear areas.</p>
<p>“But the key issue will be to what extent the irregulars can intimidate, or are </p>
<p>supported by the local population. Only a substantial, active and visible Coalition </p>
<p>troop presence can guarantee true control …” </p>
<p><b>357. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on 3 April that the mood swing in the </p>

<p>192</p>
<p> On 1 April there had been </p>
<p>blanket coverage of the alleged shortcomings of the military campaign and criticisms </p>
<p>from military officers in the Pentagon and the Gulf, which reflected the genuine </p>
<p>concerns of some military officers about the inadequacy of current force levels in Iraq </p>
<p>and frustration with Secretary Rumsfeld’s style and policies. Some officers believed </p>
<p>that Secretary Rumsfeld had deliberately argued for lower forces to show the power </p>
<p>of a transformed US military. There were also reports, attributed to UK officers, </p>
<p>criticising US tactics. The following day the media were all reporting the new Coalition </p>

<p><b>359. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the messages to the Iraqi people about their future should </p>
<p>be reinforced. In the South we could demonstrate how life could be improved. </p>
<p><b>360. </b> Following the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 3 April, Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant </p>
<p>Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, advised </p>
<p>Sir David Manning that:</p>
<p>“The next two days should tell whether the momentum created by the latest US </p>
<p>advance will carry them into Baghdad and/or prompt regime collapse. More likely, </p>
<p>the US will attempt to gain a stranglehold and then await reinforcements through the </p>
<p>4th Infantry Division which is now starting to unload in Kuwait. If the latter, the main </p>
<p>battle for Baghdad would be fought in May. In the interim, the US would look for the </p>
<p>fall of Basra, and some of the other towns which it has bypassed. General Reith, </p>
<p>who has just returned from theatre reported that British forces hope to complete </p>
<p>the taking of az-Zubayr within the next 48 hours and Basra in the next 2–3 weeks. </p>
<p>They are now getting a good flow of information out of Basra and have identified </p>
<p>Shia groups who would be willing to take on Saddam’s irregulars.” </p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>361.  Cabinet on 3 April was informed that:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the US advance had been remarkable and it would consolidate its position;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>UK forces had taken control of most towns in the region and were “waiting </b></p>
<p><b>for the right moment” to take over Basra; it could provide a model for </b></p>
<p><b>dealing with Baghdad; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>progress would be uneven and the Government would need to be steady </b></p>
<p><b>in its resolve.</b></p>
<p><b>362. </b> At Cabinet, Mr Blair said that the military campaign could best be described in </p>
<p>three phases.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> In the first, Coalition Forces had taken a strategic grip on the country, </p>
<p>advancing from the south, preventing Iraqi aggression towards Jordan or Israel in the </p>
<p>west and fixing Iraqi forces in the North and East. The second phase was one of steady </p>
<p>advance. US forces were advancing beyond Karbala and al-Kut to encircle Baghdad. </p>
<p>The UK Division was “chipping away at Basra, taking control of most of the towns in the </p>
<p>region and waiting for the right moment to take over Basra itself”. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Mr Hoon told his colleagues that the US advance had been remarkable and </p>
<p>the leading units were within 15 miles of Baghdad. US forces would consolidate their </p>
<p>position as they progressed, bringing in reinforcements. Once Baghdad was isolated, </p>
<p>the military question would be how to deal with it. </p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 3 April 2003. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Mr Hoon suggested that Basra could be a model for the best approach. It was now </p>
<p>isolated, with the main access road from the north controlled by Coalition Forces. Inside </p>
<p>the city, the regime militia’s control by terror was being eroded. Intelligence suggested </p>
<p>that the local people’s mood was changing as confidence grew that the Coalition would </p>
<p>see the job through. Aggressive patrolling would continue to send a message about the </p>
<p>Coalition’s commitment. </p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Blair stated that the third phase would be the collapse of the regime. </p>
<p>The country had been in the grip of a security apparatus which continued to fight for </p>
<p>the regime. It appeared that the population at large did not support the regime, but </p>
<p>they lacked the confidence to rise up until they could be sure that the change would be </p>
<p>permanent. Mr Blair could not forecast how long it would take for the regime to collapse, </p>
<p>but only one outcome was possible. Good progress was being made militarily. </p>
<p><b>366. </b> In discussion, concerns were expressed about the scale of casualties likely to </p>
<p>result from urban fighting in Baghdad. Continued pressure for regime collapse was </p>
<p>preferable. Protection of the Shia holy sites at Karbala and Najaf was a priority for the </p>
<p>Coalition. The UK was publicising reports that the regime intended to damage them and </p>
<p>attribute that to the Coalition. Iraqi troops were using schools and hospitals as military </p>
<p>positions and, in the South, an ammunition store had been found inside a school. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Blair concluded that Cabinet very much appreciated the way UK forces had </p>
<p>conducted themselves. Progress was being made on the military, humanitarian and </p>
<p>political fronts. The situation was better than could have been expected at that stage. </p>
<p>Progress on the ground would nevertheless be uneven and the Government would </p>
<p>need to be steady in its resolve. The ultimate judgement on the conflict would be based </p>
<p>on whether Iraq was a better place for its people and if the international community </p>
<p>regained its unity of purpose. </p>
<p><b>368.  Mr Hoon’s statement to the House of Commons conveyed the message that </b></p>
<p><b>steady progress was being made. </b></p>
<p><b>369. </b> In a statement to the House of Commons on 3 April, Mr Hoon said:</p>
<p>“Our strategic grip on Iraq is tightening. In the South, British forces continue </p>
<p>to operate in the al-Faw Peninsula, the southern oilfields and the Basra area. </p>
<p>The 7 Armoured Brigade is preventing Iraqi forces in Basra from hindering the </p>
<p>main advance, while establishing corridors for the safe movement of civilians and </p>
<p>humanitarian aid …</p>
<p>“In the area of Abu Al Khasib, in the south-east outskirts of Basra, 3 Commando </p>
<p>Brigade have engaged substantial Iraqi forces, capturing significant numbers of </p>
<p>enemy forces, including senior Iraqi officers … Key suburbs of Basra have now been </p>
<p>taken. We will go further into the city at a time of our own choosing … </p>

<p>“The security situation in a growing number of areas is such that troops are </p>
<p>patrolling on foot rather than in armoured cars, and have in some cases been able </p>
<p>to exchange their combat helmets for berets.” </p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Mr Hoon also stated that the Iraqi regime had suppressed disturbances in Basra </p>
<p>on 25 March and opened fire on civilians preparing to leave Basra on 28 March.</p>
<p><b>4 April</b></p>
<p><b>371. </b> Adm Boyce told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 4 April that UK forces had made </p>
<p>a “lodgement” in Basra and continued to apply pressure on the militia, whose ability to </p>
<p>maintain control of the city “was diminishing”.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>372. </b> On the same day, Mr Ingram and Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Squire, Chief of the </p>
<p>Air Staff, gave a press conference at the Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> Mr Ingram told reporters:</p>
<p>“… the Coalition has seen further steady progress both in terms of military advance </p>
<p>and in terms of the other crucial battle … winning the confidence of the Iraqi people </p>
<p>through increased normalisation and security.</p>
<p>“… two halves of equal importance and our military campaign objectives reflect </p>
<p>this fully.</p>
<p>“… What has been particularly important about the way this campaign has </p>
<p>developed is the relationship between these twin objectives … as the war fighting </p>
<p>progresses to a conclusion, we are implementing, at times simultaneously, a security </p>
<p>framework for peace. </p>
<p>“… Our approach to the assault on Basra is highly illustrative of this. There is no </p>
<p>question that the fire power available … could be used to a more immediate but </p>
<p>destructive effect … Our restraint should not be interpreted as weakness, rather it </p>
<p>is a sign of care … The city of Basra is contained. Our commanders on the ground </p>
<p>will use their own professionalism and sound military judgement to decide when and </p>
<p>how to enter the city.”</p>
<p><b>373. </b> The press conference also addressed the conduct of the air campaign. Mr Ingram </p>
<p>stressed the greater focus on precision in that campaign and that “our overriding </p>
<p>concern has been to minimise … civilian casualties and unnecessary casualties on out </p>
<p>own side”. Targeting policy had been driven by “a clear moral imperative to minimise </p>
<p>civilian casualties. There is of course a legal obligation to do the same … [and] a </p>
<p>practical argument derived from our post-conflict ambitions for Iraq”.</p>

<p><b>377. </b> On 4 April, the text of a letter from Mr Blair to the people of Iraq, which was being </p>
<p>distributed by UK troops in Iraq, was reported in the media.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> In the letter Mr Blair </p>
<p>assured readers that Saddam Hussein would be “gone”, and went on to make the </p>
<p>following commitments:</p>
<p>“Our troops will leave as soon as they can. They will not stay a day longer than </p>
<p>necessary. </p>
<p>“We will make sure deliveries of vital aid such as food, medicine and drinking water </p>
<p>get through.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to move as soon as possible to an interim authority run by Iraqis. </p>
<p>This will pave the way for a truly representative Iraqi government, which respects </p>
<p>human rights and the rule of law; develops public services; and spends Iraq’s wealth </p>
<p>not on palaces and weapons of mass destruction, but on schools and hospitals.”</p>
<p><b>US forces enter Baghdad</b></p>
<p><b>378. </b> Mr Scarlett informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 5 April that the Republican </p>
<p>Guard had suffered comprehensive defeat outside Baghdad, and that the loss of the </p>
<p>airport appeared to have had a shock effect on the militias.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> There was uncertainty </p>
<p>about the militias’ ability to reconstitute the defence of the city. The Republican Guard </p>
<p>had evacuated positions in the North. With the disablement of communications and </p>
<p>therefore control, the general sense was that the Iraqi regime was collapsing. </p>
<p><b>379. </b> Adm Boyce stated that a heavy armoured US unit had entered Baghdad to </p>
<p>demonstrate to the population that the regime had lost control. The question for Coalition </p>
<p>commanders was whether to maintain the momentum and take Baghdad, or consolidate </p>
<p>and establish a cordon round the city. In the North, the Regular Army had been badly </p>
<p>damaged by air attack and might be prepared to capitulate. In the South, the British </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>The fall of Basra</b></p>
<p><b>383.  On 5 April, Mr Hoon was informed of the plans to enter Basra. He was also </b></p>
<p><b>informed that the issue of UK forces moving north from the original area of </b></p>
<p><b>operations could arise “in the near future”. </b></p>
<p><b>384. </b> Mr Johnson sent a summary of the plan for 1 (UK) Div to enter Basra to Mr Hoon’s </p>
<p>Office on 5 April.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Johnson reported that the “planned window for entry into Basra opens on </p>
<p>Monday 7 April”; and that the plan was split into three phases:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase 1 intended to establish “a degree of control in az-Zubayr which is </p>
<p>sufficiently firm to allow 7 Armd Bde units to be released for operations in </p>
<p>Basra”, was already under way.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase 2 would “involve a shift of forces from ‘consolidation’ tasks to operations </p>
<p>in Basra, and subsequent expansion as required” in addition to the tasks of </p>
<p>Phase 1. The plan had also called for elements of 3 Commando Brigade to </p>
<p>replace 7 Armoured Brigade in az-Zubayr, enabled by the replacement of </p>
<p>3 Commando Brigade in Umm Qasr by the (UK) 102 Logistics Brigade.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase 3 of the plan, entry into Basra, required 3 Commando Brigade and </p>
<p>7 Armoured Brigade to attack Iraqi forces, secure key water infrastructure, and </p>
<p>take opportunities to seize Basra Palace and any Governorate buildings. 16 Air </p>
<p>Assault Brigade would control Highway 6 and distract Iraqi forces by conducting </p>
<p>“aggressive patrolling” north of Basra. It would also provide a reserve force. </p>
<p><b>386. </b> Mr Johnson wrote that Phase 3 would take place only when a number of </p>
<p>preconditions had been met, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>az-Zubayr was firmly under control and passed to 3 Commando Brigade;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was stability in the 3 Commando Brigade AO, with the area south of </p>
<p>Basra isolated;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stability existed in the 16 Air Assault Brigade AO, north of Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Highway 6 was capable of being controlled by 16 Air Assault Brigade; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>authority was granted by the Coalition Forces Land Component Commander </p>
<p>(Lt Gen McKiernan).</p>
<p><b>387. </b> When the conditions were right, 3 Commando Brigade and 7 Armoured Brigade </p>
<p>would “attack to secure areas of Basra, supported by air and artillery strikes”; 16 Air </p>
<p>Assault Brigade would provide a reserve infantry battlegroup for the operation.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Mr Johnson reported that 1 (UK) Div’s intention was that the entry into Basra </p>
<p>would be:</p>
<p>“… supported by information operations, to reassure the population and isolate them </p>
<p>from regime propaganda, and by humanitarian assistance … The combined effect </p>
<p>should be to build popular confidence in Coalition capabilities and intentions … </p>
<p>News of the US entry into Baghdad should reinforce this effect.”</p>
<p><b>389. </b> Mr Johnson reminded Mr Hoon of the possible requirement for subsequent </p>
<p>expansion northwards to “take on and defeat Iraqi forces posing a potential threat to </p>
<p>Basra, if this was necessary to achieve a satisfactory outcome to Phase III of the overall </p>
<p>campaign”. He stated: “This issue may well arise in the near future.” Mr Johnson also </p>
<p>advised: “We therefore intend that GOC 1 (UK) Div should have flexibility to move north </p>
<p>to defeat these forces or accept their surrender, if required.”</p>
<p><b>390. </b> A second piece of advice, sent to Mr Hoon’s Office later the same day, reported a </p>
<p>proposal to “recruit, arm and co-ordinate the activity of 20 Iraqis to support 1 (UK) Div </p>
<p>operations in Basra”.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p> The advice recommended that Mr Hoon agree the proposal to </p>
<p>recruit ex-regular soldiers to conduct reconnaissance into Basra, and to attack personnel </p>
<p>linked to Saddam Hussein’s regime, armed with weapons seized by Coalition Forces. </p>
<p>The advice said: “At the end of the operation, the volunteers would be asked to return </p>
<p>their weapons.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>391. </b> An update for Sir David Manning provided by Mr Drummond on 6 April reported </p>
<p>that a Coalition air strike in Basra had “resulted in the deaths of several top regime </p>
<p>figures”.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> UK raids into the city the previous night had met “little resistance”. </p>
<p>7 Armoured Brigade “now have a lodgement well into the city, and, subject to CFLCC </p>
<p>agreement, will push further in today”. The plan for 3 Commando was “to push in from </p>
<p>the south-east”. </p>
<p><b>392.  UK forces entered Basra in force on the night of 6/7 April.</b></p>
<p><b>393. </b> Mr Scarlett told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 7 April that, in Basra, the hard core </p>
<p>of the militias had retreated into the old town, while senior party and military figures were </p>
<p>reported to be leaving the city or willing to surrender.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> Rumours of the death of the </p>
<p>regional military commander (Chemical Ali) were rife.</p>
<p><b>394. </b> Adm Boyce reported that the British Division had entered Basra the previous night:</p>
<p>“… in force, following signs of impatience about the stand-off by the local population </p>
<p>in the light of diminishing Iraqi militia confidence. Resistance was incoherent but still </p>
<p>dangerous; locals were helping the Coalition inside the town.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>395. </b> Mr Blair concluded the meeting by saying that the military success in Basra was </p>
<p>significant and he was counting on an information campaign by the military to persuade </p>
<p>the irregulars who were still fighting to desist. The Iraqi regime was finished and the </p>
<p>irregulars should be taken into custody by the British, not lynched by fellow Iraqis. </p>
<p><b>396. </b> Mr Hoon told the House of Commons on 7 April that:</p>
<p>“Since my last statement on 3 April, Coalition Forces have continued to make </p>
<p>excellent progress. Following a series of raids and patrols into the centre of the </p>
<p>city, British forces have now deployed in force into Basra. United States Army and </p>
<p>Marine Corps units have with remarkable speed advanced on Baghdad, seized the </p>
<p>international airport and conducted patrols into the city centre …</p>
<p>“We have consistently encouraged members of the Iraqi armed forces to end their </p>
<p>increasingly futile resistance and return to their homes and families. We are now </p>
<p>beginning to see indications that these messages are having an impact, at least </p>
<p>on some Iraqi soldiers. That does not mean, however, that the regime’s resistance </p>
<p>is necessarily at an end. In Basra, Baghdad and other urban areas, Coalition </p>
<p>Forces will face a difficult and dangerous period dealing with the remnants of </p>
<p>Iraqi forces …” </p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>397. </b> The COBR evening round-up on 7 April described resistance in Basra as less </p>
<p>than expected.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>398. </b> While no area was safe enough to call in humanitarian assistance, power and food </p>
<p>were available to the majority of the population and the slight shortages of water were </p>
<p>not significant.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>399. </b> On 8 April, Mr Scarlett informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq, which was chaired by </p>
<p>Mr Prescott, that the pattern of declining resistance in the South was not uniform; and </p>
<p>that there was no definitive information about the find by Coalition Forces of material </p>
<p>which could be chemical and biological warfare agents.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>400. </b> Adm Boyce stated that, following the UK Division’s assumption of control </p>
<p>over Basra, the emphasis would switch from fighting to the post-conflict phase. </p>
<p>The Commander would be organising a meeting with local leaders the following </p>
<p>day to re-establish normality in the town and to arrange the provision of food and </p>
<p>water. The Southern Regional Director of the US-led Office of Reconstruction and </p>
<p>Humanitarian Affairs would move to Umm Qasr that day. </p>

<p>71</p>
<p><b>401. </b> In discussion, the Ad Hoc Meeting noted that the welcome given to British troops </p>
<p>entering Basra had been covered in very different ways by different television channels. </p>
<p>The looting of regime premises should not be permitted to degenerate into general </p>
<p>lawlessness. It was likely to be difficult to assure the civil police function as the Iraqi </p>
<p>police had in the past been closely associated with the regime’s apparatus of repression.</p>
<p><b>402. </b> Mr Prescott concluded that the conduct of UK forces in assuming control of </p>
<p>Basra had been commendable. Opportunities to conduct interviews with scientists </p>
<p>who had been engaged on Iraq’s WMD programmes should be “pursued when the </p>
<p>fighting stopped”. </p>
<p><b>403. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were informed on 8 April that the troops clearing the old city </p>
<p>area had been “met by a jubilant population”.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush made a joint statement at Hillsborough on 8 April </p>
<p>setting out the Coalition’s intentions for the future of Iraq, which is set out in Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>405. </b> A report that evening stated: “The situation in the city [Basra] has stabilised … </p>
<p>although looting will remain a problem until normal policing is restored.” </p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>406. </b> The overnight report from COBR on 8/9 April informed Sir David Manning that </p>
<p>Maj Gen Brims had identified a potential local leader in Basra “with whom he can do </p>
<p>business” and had begun the process of establishing a Joint Commission.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> Looting </p>
<p>was “not as bad as reported in the media”. </p>
<p><b>407. </b> Adm Boyce informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 9 April that, in Basra, UK </p>
<p>forces would be lowering their profile by withdrawing some of the heavy armour.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Commander had also started the process of establishing a Joint Commission which </p>
<p>should help to restore order locally. Looting “was reducing, in part because of Iraqi </p>
<p>self-policing.” </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Ms Short was concerned about the looting of humanitarian supplies and water </p>
<p>plant in the South. In discussion, it was noted that looting in Basra was more isolated </p>
<p>than some media suggested; and that the development of a civil policing capability was </p>
<p>a priority.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> In his post-operation tour report, Maj Gen Brims wrote:</p>
<p>“… collaborative planning, often led by 7 Armd Bde, was conducted to develop </p>
<p>a concept for the entry into [Basra]. The order was published on 6 [April], </p>
<p>coincidentally at the same time as the opportunity was seized by 7 Armd Bde. </p>
<p>The opportunity was created by a JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition, a GPS-guided </p>

<p>perception was that Chemical Ali [Ali Hassan al-Majid] had been killed).” </p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>410.  The UK was well informed about the structure and capabilities of the Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>armed forces but it had no intelligence pre-conflict on Iraq’s plans for the defence </b></p>
<p><b>of Basra. The JIC had assessed:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>many Regular Army units bypassed and left behind as the result of a rapid </b></p>
<p><b>Coalition advance towards Baghdad would probably surrender rather than </b></p>
<p><b>fight; </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>only Baghdad was politically vital to the Iraqi regime; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>there was little evidence that Iraq was preparing for a hard-fought defence </b></p>
<p><b>of Basra and other urban areas in southern Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>411.  The DIS advised that Iraqi irregular forces, including the Fedayeen, were </b></p>
<p><b>likely to be involved in the defence of Basra, but it did not predict the degree of </b></p>
<p><b>initial resistance to Coalition Forces.</b></p>
<p><b>412. </b> The assessments pre-conflict about the structure, conventional capabilities and </p>
<p>intentions of the Iraqi armed forces, are set out in Section 6.1. The assessment of the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime’s intentions in relation to the defence of Basra and the nature and intentions </p>
<p>of Iraqi irregular forces is summarised in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>The defence of Basra and the role of irregular forces </b></p>
<p>On 4 July 2002, the JIC assessed that the “Saddam Fedayeen”, which were “under the </p>
<p>control of Saddam’s oldest son” were “possibly 10–15,000 strong” and had “been used in </p>
<p>the past to deal with civil disturbances”.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>In its Assessment of 21 August, the JIC judged that: </p>
<p>“Iraq’s likely strategy for a ground war would be to make any Coalition advance as </p>
<p>slow and costly as possible, trying to force the Coalition to fight in urban areas.” </p>
<p>250</p>
<p>The JIC stated:</p>
<p>“We have little insight into how the Iraqi military might plan to fight any ground war </p>
<p>… At present we have little evidence to judge whether Iraq sees urban or guerrilla </p>
<p>warfare as feasible options. Iraqi effectiveness would be mitigated by problems of </p>
<p>command and control, inadequate training and poor morale. We doubt that guerrilla </p>
<p>activity would be very effective; urban warfare is more plausible.” </p>

<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>In the context of consideration of preparations for a campaign of terrorism and sabotage </p>
<p>in the region, the Assessment also stated that:</p>
<p>“… we know that Iraqi Special Forces and other organisations, such as the ‘Saddam </p>
<p>Fedayeen’, also possess the capability to conduct sabotage or terrorist attacks.” </p>
<p>The JIC did not consider the Fedayeen’s possible actions inside Iraq. </p>
<p>In its weekly intelligence summary of 16 October, the DIS advised that, given the </p>
<p>limitations in Iraq’s capabilities:</p>
<p>“… the regime is leaning towards a war of attrition from within the cities. Provincial </p>
<p>cities have been garrisoned with food and troops … The regime’s aim is to lure </p>
<p>Coalition Forces into the cities and effectively fix them … Whilst Baghdad remains </p>
<p>the vital centre of gravity, Coalition Forces will look to bypass provincial centres, </p>
<p>leaving … Iraqi forces trapped …” </p>
<p>251</p>
<p>In its Assessment of 6 December, the JIC anticipated that the Iraqi Army could </p>
<p>establish positions within urban areas, but “most R[egular] A[rmy] defences are likely </p>
<p>to be constructed further forward, nearer Iraq’s borders, or along key roads and at </p>
<p>junctions”.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> Physical barriers, “water barriers (created by flooding or by the destruction </p>
<p>of bridges), minefields, or possibly even CBW-contaminated areas”, could be created “to </p>
<p>channel Coalition Forces into urban areas or ‘kill zones’ where artillery, or CBW, would </p>
<p>be used”. The Iraqi “strategy would rely heavily on a static defence, largely because </p>
<p>the Iraqi military’s ability to conduct manoeuvre warfare is very limited, even in the </p>
<p>R[epublican G[uard]”. </p>
<p>The JIC stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… provided the security and military organisations central to the regime’s survival … </p>
<p>remained intact, Saddam would accept the sacrifice of virtually any forces or territory </p>
<p>to the coalition. Provincial cities would be defended, but ultimately we judge that only </p>
<p>Baghdad would be politically vital, as its capture would be a final symbol of defeat of </p>
<p>the regime.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the Special Republican Guard and the Republican Guard remained loyal and </p>
<p>effective, they could “inflict serious casualties on Coalition Forces in urban warfare”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Morale and loyalty was “weak”. If a rapid Coalition advance left Iraqi positions behind </p>
<p>the front lines, “many RA [Regular Army] units would probably surrender rather </p>
<p>than fight”.”</p>
<p>The JIC Assessment of 29 January 2003 stated:</p>
<p>“[M]orale in much of regular army is low and … many soldiers are reluctant to fight. </p>
<p>But as long as Iraqi security officers remain with military units and able to enforce </p>
<p>discipline, fear of execution is likely to keep regular units at their posts.” </p>
<p>253</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a minute to Sir David Manning on 30 January (see Section 3.6), Mr Scarlett wrote that </p>
<p>the JIC had judged, “over many months”, that “once the invasion starts Saddam’s regime </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>is likely to prove brittle and fold quickly”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> The correct military strategy was, therefore, </p>
<p>designed to “make this ‘quickly’ very quick indeed”. </p>
<p>In its Assessment of 19 February on what the Coalition might face in Southern Iraq, the </p>
<p>JIC judged:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi forces currently guarding Southern Iraq are a relatively weak first line of </p>
<p>conventional defence. They face rapid defeat. There is little evidence so far that the </p>
<p>Iraqis are preparing for a hard-fought defence of Basra and other urban areas.” </p>
<p>255</p>
<p>The MOD advised Mr Blair on 24 February (see Section 6.2) that the US plan was to </p>
<p>achieve “overwhelming effect very early in the campaign” to dislocate the regime by </p>
<p>decapitating command and control and disrupting communications.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p> As well as the </p>
<p>practical consequences of the deployment of ground forces and their move “towards </p>
<p>Baghdad”, the MOD stated that that should “remove any doubt in Iraqi minds about the </p>
<p>Coalition’s determination to remove the regime. It is therefore possible that the regime </p>
<p>will collapse … in the first few days. Nonetheless it is impossible to predict … and US </p>
<p>planning assumes up to 125 days of decisive ground operations.”</p>
<p>On 11 March, the DIS produced a Memorandum on the “post-Saddam” political and </p>
<p>security environment that Coalition Forces were likely to encounter in Basra City.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It stated that the DIS had “no intelligence on regime planning to mount an urban defence </p>
<p>of Basra City” but “individual or localised resistance could occur”.</p>
<p>The DIS identified the forces which were likely to be at the disposal of the regime as:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Directorate of General Security (DGS)</b> – the “principal internal security force”. </p>
<p>“Typically” such forces would be lightly armed and trained only in an internal security </p>
<p>role. The DIS assessed that once overall regime cohesion was lost, they would offer </p>
<p>“little resistance to Coalition Forces”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Ba’ath Party militia </b>– which were “expected to play a role in defence of the city. </p>
<p>They would have small arms and limited training.” Based on reporting from other </p>
<p>cities in Iraq, the DIS judged that the threat to Coalition Forces was “low”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Fedayeen </b>– which might be employed in an internal security role. </p>
<p>They had “a well-deserved reputation for brutality and fierce loyalty to the regime”. </p>
<p>They were controlled by the Basra Governor and there might be “3–4,000” within </p>
<p>the Governorate. They would have access to small arms “but rarely use armoured </p>
<p>vehicles”. They were assessed to be “the most likely internal security force to repress </p>
<p>the civil populace and possibly oppose Coalition Forces within the city”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Mujahideen e Khalq (MEK)</b> – the numbers in Basra and its environs were “unlikely </p>
<p>to exceed a few hundred”. If there was a presence in Basra, the DIS judged that it </p>
<p>would fight, “if directly threatened by Coalition operations. But if they are left alone the </p>
<p>intelligence is contradictory as to whether they would fight with the Iraqi Army …”  </p>
<p>There was a risk that Iran would send Badr Corps or Islamic Revolutionary Guard </p>
<p>Corps teams into the Basra area to take action against the MEK, “especially if Tehran </p>
<p>considers that the Coalition has not taken appropriate action against the MEK”.</p>

<p>75</p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry that the UK “did not necessarily know at the time” that Iraqi </p>
<p>forces were weak; whether Iraq would use battlefield chemical weapons; and that the </p>
<p>UK’s operational planning was looking at the potential Iraqi response “in as rigorous and </p>
<p>austere military operational terms as possible”.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>Describing his assessment that his division was ready for military operations against the </p>
<p>assessed capability of Iraqi forces and their likely courses of action, Lt Gen Brims, GOC </p>
<p>1(UK) Div between 2000 and 2003, and the UK Land Contingent Commander during the </p>
<p>invasion, told the Inquiry that the UK had “expected unconventional forces … to show, </p>
<p>which they did”.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ACM Burridge told the Inquiry that Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… had developed the view … that western militaries don’t do urban warfare …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“What we didn’t know was to what extent he would front-load those southern cities, </p>
<p>Basra in particular, and we subsequently recognised he put small elements of the </p>
<p>Republican Guard in amongst the Ba’ath militia the Al Quds and people such as </p>
<p>that, to … make them militarily more effective and … to put the frighteners on the </p>
<p>51 Division people who had effectively melted away, and they were coerced into </p>
<p>getting back into their equipment.” </p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>413.  Within days of the start of the campaign, the scale of the unexpected </b></p>
<p><b>resistance encountered in Southern Iraq, together with the effects of bad weather </b></p>
<p><b>and the slow down in the US advance on Baghdad, led to a media focus on </b></p>
<p><b>perceived difficulties with the Coalition campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>414.  The evidence in this Section shows that, as a result, there was considerable </b></p>
<p><b>concern within the UK Government about the impact on public and political </b></p>
<p><b>support for the campaign in the UK, and concern about the Coalition’s ability to </b></p>
<p><b>convince the Iraqi population that it was determined and able to remove Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein and his regime.</b></p>
<p><b>415.  The UK Government identified a need for better co-ordination and </b></p>
<p><b>communication of key strategic messages to different audiences in an effort </b></p>
<p><b>to win the “propaganda war”. Improvements to UK capabilities were being </b></p>
<p><b>implemented at the end of March.</b></p>
<p><b>416.  There was also considerable debate, within and between the MOD and No.10, </b></p>
<p><b>about whether the military plan should be revised to secure control of Basra </b></p>
<p><b>before proceeding to Baghdad, including Mr Blair’s decision to raise the idea with </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>417.  Although some of that debate within the UK Government may well have </b></p>
<p><b>reached military commanders in Iraq, the evidence set out in this Section </b></p>
<p><b>shows that, in the end, the decision to advance into Basra was made by military </b></p>
<p><b>commanders on the ground. </b></p>
<p><b>418.  It reflected their judgement that the preconditions for the operation, set out </b></p>
<p><b>in the MOD advice to Mr Hoon of 5 April, had been met. </b></p>
<p><b>419. </b> In a post-operation tour interview, conducted at the Army’s Land Warfare Centre, </p>
<p>Maj Gen Brims said:</p>
<p>“The raids themselves [in Basra] were going in ever more successfully too. </p>
<p>On 5 April the battlegroup raids were staying in longer in each time, in essence they </p>
<p>were doing [battlegroup vehicle checkpoints] coming back only at night because the </p>
<p>enemy could get too close. But on Sunday 6 April the Black Watch launched a raid </p>
<p>and met no resistance. I consulted Commander 7 [Armoured] Brigade [Brigadier </p>
<p>Binns] and gave out radio orders. We got into Basra that day and stayed … </p>
<p>I did remember to get clearance from [the Coalition Forces Land Component </p>
<p>Commander, Lt Gen McKiernan] beforehand.” </p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Lt Gen Brims told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“When we first got into Basra, it took about a day of combat activity to get in there </p>
<p>on 6 April. By 7 April, we were in and we were reasonably well received …”</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>421. </b> Lt Gen Brims also stated: </p>
<p>“We produced a generic plan [for Basra] and one of the first things I did when I </p>
<p>realised that we had in fact got into Basra and we were controlling the city, is I got </p>
<p>together through an individual I approached and asked him to form a provisional </p>
<p>council from which we would then use the Iraqis to help us organise Basra …” </p>
<p>263</p>
<p><b>422. </b> Maj Gen Binns told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I didn’t really have a clear idea of how we were going to enter Basra. </p>
<p>The operational analysts were saying, ‘It will take you three months, you will suffer </p>
<p>25 percent casualties and there will be thousands if not tens of thousands of civilian </p>
<p>deaths’ and Robin Brims and I then had a conversation, ‘Well we can’t do that and </p>
<p>therefore we’ve got to come up with a different way of doing it, so we will only enter </p>
<p>Basra, hopefully on our terms, when the time is right and in a manner that reduces </p>
<p>casualties on both sides’ …</p>

<p>“I then had a sort of conversation with a friend of mine who was working in General </p>
<p>McKiernan’s headquarters. I said, you know, ‘Have I got this right, this is my </p>
<p>thinking’, and he said, ‘Actually the view here is that we would like you to go into </p>

<p>and let’s see how far we can go.” </p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>423. </b> Major General Albert Whitley, the Senior British Land Adviser to the Coalition </p>
<p>Forces Land Component Commander, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“As I understand it there was no pressure from Whitehall or PJHQ to influence </p>
<p>the timing of the taking of Basra. Gen McKiernan also did not put pressure </p>
<p>on Gen Brims to take it early. I was present when he told Gen Brims that  </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Scarlett informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 10 April that news of the </p>
<p>collapse of the regime was spreading.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>429. </b> Adm Boyce added that Iraqi forces remained in Tikrit, Mosul and Kirkuk, although </p>
<p>there were indications that the Regular Army was ready to surrender to Coalition Forces </p>
<p>once those were in the vicinity in sufficient strength. Resistance in the East and West </p>
<p>had “reduced significantly” and Basra “[was] returning to normality”. The Coalition </p>
<p>needed to bring the “large quantity of abandoned arms and military equipment under </p>
<p>control”. The lack of mains electricity was attributable to Iraqi sabotage. Looting was </p>
<p>a problem in Baghdad but was “much reduced in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>430. </b> In discussion, attendees noted that records and other material about the regime’s </p>

<p>could be accessed for forensic purposes. </p>
<p><b>431. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Blair stated that the Coalition’s Freedom Television </p>
<p>station would start broadcasting that day. It was important to provide evidence to the </p>
<p>media of Iraqi sabotage of the electricity network. Assembling documentation and </p>
<p>material about the former Iraqi regime was a priority task and resources should be </p>
<p>directed to this. </p>
<p><b>432. </b> In response to Mr Straw’s concerns that the “continental European media was </p>
<p>not reflecting the Coalition’s success or the argumentation for military action”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>concluded that a media campaign should be directed at rectifying the portrayal in the </p>
<p>European media of events leading up to the conflict and its resolution.</p>
<p><b>433. </b> Mr Blair informed Cabinet on 10 April that the military campaign in Iraq was </p>
<p>progressing well, but it was not over yet.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> Some resistance to US forces continued in </p>
<p>Baghdad. The Iraqis might make a last stand in the North, perhaps around Tikrit. In the </p>
<p>West and East, Iraqi resistance was diminishing. In the South, resistance had largely </p>
<p>disappeared. After initial looting in Basra, the situation was now calmer. </p>
<p><b>434. </b> Mr Blair stated that the Coalition was now in the end game of the Iraqi regime’s </p>
<p>collapse. Apart from military resistance, there were humanitarian challenges, including </p>
<p>restoring the electricity system which had been sabotaged by the retreating militias. </p>
<p>Making the lot of the Iraqis better had to be the continuing focus. While British public </p>
<p>opinion recognised our success to date, media coverage in the rest of the world was </p>
<p>largely negative. That had to be turned round. The first Coalition broadcast to the Iraqi </p>
<p>people using their network would take place that day. </p>
<p><b>435. </b> Mr Hoon told his colleagues that elements of the Iraqi regime had not yet </p>
<p>recognised that the battle was lost. </p>

<p>79</p>
<p><b>436. </b> In Basra, the water and electricity supplies were being fixed and order was being </p>
<p>restored with the exercise of civic responsibility by local Iraqis. A Joint Commission was </p>
<p>being established with the emerging leadership there. The intention was to spread the </p>
<p>same effect northwards.</p>
<p><b>437. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Blair said that the military campaign in Iraq was </p>
<p>going extremely well, but there were challenges ahead on the humanitarian front, </p>
<p>in dealing with post-conflict arrangements and bringing together the international </p>
<p>community in the UN Security Council. Mr Blair reiterated his conclusion at the previous </p>
<p>meeting of Cabinet that making the lives of ordinary Iraqis better was key to success. </p>
<p><b>438. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 10 April, they discussed the position </p>
<p>in Iraq, including the possibility of a major battle in Tikrit and the need to warn Syria </p>
<p>not to give refuge to regime figures or to scientists who knew about Iraq’s WMD.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>439. </b> The UK AO was extended north to al-Amara in Maysan province on 11 April, when </p>
<p>Pathfinders from 16 Air Assault Brigade entered the city. The remainder of the force </p>
<p>entered on 12 April.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>440. </b> Mr Hoon approved the extension of the UK AO to the whole of the provinces </p>
<p>of Basra and Maysan on 12 April.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>441. </b> The background to that decision and subsequent developments are addressed </p>
<p>later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>The role of UK Special Forces</b></p>
<p>According to Gen Franks’ account of his plan:</p>
<p>“… US, Brit, and Australian Special Operations Forces would control Iraq’s western </p>
<p>desert, preventing the regime freedom of action to launch long-range missiles </p>
<p>towards Jordan and Israel.” </p>
<p>275</p>
<p>Gen Franks described the combination of “several thousand” US Special Forces soldiers </p>
<p>and Special Mission troopers, plus “British and Australian Special Air Service operators”, </p>
<p>assembled in Jordan and Saudi Arabia ready to attack western Iraq as “the largest combat </p>
<p>formation of special operators in history”.</p>
<p>From 23 March, the MOD sent regular updates on Special Forces’ activities in Iraq </p>
<p>to No.10.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>A small team conducted reconnaissance of Basra.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>24 March:</b> UK Special Forces supporting 1 (UK) Div were on standby to enter Basra; </p>
<p>in the absence of permission to do so, they passed information from within the city to </p>
<p>Maj Gen Brims.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>25 March:</b> UK Special Forces continued to assist in planning for entry into Basra by </p>
<p>conducting further reconnaissance.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> The MOD assessed it was “too soon to divert effort </p>
<p>from the strategically critical task of countering the ballistic missile threat in the West”.</p>
<p>DSF1 told the Inquiry that there were Special Forces units “in the South in support of the </p>
<p>overall effort”.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> Those forces were there to “support the conventional operation with the </p>
<p>British forces … into Basra”.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>DSF1 described the role of Special Forces as providing information to inform target </p>
<p>selection, for instance:</p>
<p>“… to establish where members of the Ba’ath Party and some of the Fedayeen were </p>
<p>meeting, which obviously was not in the Ba’ath Party headquarters, which had been </p>
<p>destroyed … by the strike quite early on.” </p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>26 March: </b>Special Forces continued to support targeting in Basra and the team was </p>
<p>enhanced with extra personnel.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p><b>27 March:</b> Special Forces were in discussion with key individuals in Basra, who gave </p>
<p>indications that they were prepared to co-operate with UK forces.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>28 March:</b> Operations continued in western Iraq to interdict Iraqi movement and so </p>
<p>prevent missile launches, and in Basra to support targeting.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>30 March:</b> Special Forces supported Black Watch raids into Basra.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p><b>3 April:</b> Operations in the West continued, clearing Named Areas of Interest and engaging </p>
<p>directly with the enemy.</p>

<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>After major combat operations ended, DSF1 told the Inquiry, UK Special Forces moved to </p>
<p>Baghdad, because:</p>
<p>“That’s where our main principal linkage, that’s where my sense of how we could best </p>
<p>support … my view is that Special Forces quite rightly operate at a higher level, and </p>
<p>therefore it is about actually the success of the campaign.” </p>
<p>289</p>
<p>DSF2 told the Inquiry that when he assumed command in 2003, the main force was </p>
<p>in Baghdad “on a mission from CJO to assist the people finding weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>The immediate aftermath</b></p>
<p><b>442. </b> Maj Gen Binns told the Inquiry that he had not felt constrained by the absence of </p>
<p>a policy on what to do when Basra fell.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> Nor had his forces trained for that role. He felt </p>
<p>he had sufficient freedom of action and the experience and knowledge from previous </p>
<p>operations, including operations with some of 7 Armoured Brigade in Pristina (Kosovo), </p>
<p>to know what to do and to create the environment for stability. </p>
<p><b>443. </b> Gen Jackson told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 11 April that anarchic behaviour </p>
<p>in Baghdad, and earlier in Basra, was directed mainly at the regime, and was not </p>
<p>generalised lawlessness.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> It would be some days before the situation calmed down </p>
<p>in Baghdad; in Basra, the adaptability of British troops in managing security had had a </p>
<p>good effect. The problem was that civil policing had largely disappeared because of its </p>
<p>association with the Ba’athist regime and would be difficult to resurrect because of the </p>
<p>vulnerability of individuals to reprisals. This is considered in more detail in Section 12.1.</p>
<p><b>444. </b> Mr Hoon said that responsibility for security fell in the first instance to the military </p>
<p>and the UK was active in encouraging police in the South to return to duty. The Office </p>
<p>of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) – described in detail in </p>
<p>Section 10.1 – would be involved in restoring the civil administration of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>445. </b> Ms Short stated that the ICRC and UN agencies were concerned about </p>
<p>lawlessness in Baghdad and elsewhere. Hospitals in particular needed to be secured. </p>
<p>The systems in place for the distribution of food and the restoration of the water supply </p>
<p>were disabled by the lack of security.</p>
<p><b>446. </b> Mr Scarlett told those present that the vacuum created by the collapse of the </p>
<p>regime was being filled in different ways in different parts of the country. Gen Jackson </p>
<p>stated that the US was putting forces into Kirkuk and Mosul, the latter to take the </p>
<p>surrender of elements of the Regular Army. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>447. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Blair said that the security situation in the cities </p>
<p>had to be stabilised, particularly for hospitals. Although a violent release of anger in </p>
<p>response to the fall of the regime was inevitable, the humanitarian situation had to be </p>
<p>improved. The three basics were food, water and healthcare, on which DFID should </p>
<p>provide advice on both the current situation and the strategy for the future. More broadly, </p>
<p>Iraq had some way to go before the outlook was satisfactory. Meanwhile we had to </p>
<p>nurture the beginning of a different attitude towards the post-conflict situation among the </p>
<p>international community.</p>
<p><b>448. </b> On 12 April, Gen Jackson told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq that:</p>
<p>“… lawlessness was the main problem. The situation in Basra was being brought </p>
<p>under control and the British Division intended to start joint military/[Iraqi] civil police </p>
<p>patrols within 48 hours. Baghdad was a bigger problem …” </p>
<p>293</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>449. </b> Ms Short reported that UN vehicles had been looted in Baghdad and that the ICRC </p>
<p>feared the outbreak of disease. Disorder in Baghdad and elsewhere was preventing the </p>
<p>return of UN agencies. Mr Hoon suggested that getting UN agencies and others back to </p>
<p>work in the South would enable the British to set an example of how to restore normality. </p>
<p>This would create a virtuous circle which could progressively be replicated by the </p>
<p>Americans further north. </p>
<p><b>450. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Blair said that disorder in Iraq was the main issue. </p>
<p>It was important to stabilise the situation in Iraq before engaging on the UN track and </p>
<p>the establishment of an Iraqi interim authority. </p>
<p><b>451. </b> HQ 1 (UK) Div moved to Basra Airport on 13 April.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>452. </b> 1 (UK) Div continued to advance north of Basra, into Maysan province.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>453. </b> Joint UK patrols with Iraqi police officers commenced in Basra on 13 April (see </p>
<p>Section 9.1).</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> Local populations set up their own security arrangements in some other </p>
<p>towns in the UK AO.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> 16 Air Assault Brigade secured the air field at al-Amara on 13 April.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> The situation </p>
<p>in al-Amara was described as “stable”, with looting having ceased.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> The local police </p>
<p>had “disbanded and disappeared” about a week earlier, leaving “rather ad hoc” security </p>
<p>arrangements.</p>

<p>83</p>
<p><b>455. </b> Adm Boyce informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 14 April that the military </p>
<p>campaign was coming to an end and that Gen Franks had said the Coalition was within </p>
<p>a few days of declaring the switch to post-conflict operations.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> Adm Boyce had visited </p>
<p>British troops in the South who were “in good heart and demonstrating their flexibility in </p>
<p>dealing with the shifting security situation”. Consideration was being given to the security </p>
<p>management of the post-conflict phase, where the British Division might take charge of </p>
<p>two provinces and supervise a further two with other troops joining the Coalition for that </p>
<p>purpose. </p>
<p><b>456. </b> Mr Blair concluded that progress needed to be made on policing.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>457. </b> The issue of looting in Baghdad was also discussed in Mr Blair’s conversation with </p>
<p>President Bush on 14 April.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Mr Blair identified improving conditions in hospitals as the top humanitarian priority </p>
<p>and the main focus of media interest; Baghdad was still not a safe environment for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance. </p>
<p><b>UK comments on levels of deployed US forces</b></p>
<p>Reporting on his visit to UK forces in Kuwait in early March 2003, Gen Jackson, wrote that </p>
<p>he had been “struck by just how little combat power the US have on the ground now that </p>
<p>4ID cannot deploy in time to influence the outcome”.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> The UK would have “a little under </p>
<p>one third of the available Coalition armour”. That combat power “may prove decisive for </p>
<p>operations around Baghdad”. </p>
<p>Admiral the Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that he was:</p>
<p>“… always extremely concerned about the anorexic nature of the American </p>
<p>contribution, and not just because the Fourth Infantry Division was taking a while </p>
<p>to get there, but because it was Rumsfeld’s view … that the Americans, certainly </p>
<p>at that particular stage … were very much, ‘We are here to do the war fighting, not </p>
<p>the peacekeeping.’ And combine that with the obsession that Mr Rumsfeld had with </p>
<p>network-centric warfare and therefore to prove that you could minimise the number </p>
<p>of your troops, in particular, because you had clever methods of conducting warfare, </p>
<p>other than using boots on the ground, meant that … we were desperately under-</p>
<p>resourced … so far as those forces going towards Baghdad were concerned.</p>
<p>“So, once the battle had been won, we didn’t have the boots on the ground to </p>
<p>consolidate.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Asked about the limits of the forces deployed by the US and the consequential importance </p>
<p>of the UK’s role in protecting the US flank, Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fry told the </p>
<p>Inquiry, “we were taking a risk, we knew we were taking a risk”.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DSF1 told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The force levels were limited, there was no force that could be put out into the </p>
<p>Euphrates Valley because there was no force available. The force was capable of </p>
<p>knocking off, with the air and the land and the marine manoeuvre, it was [cap]able of </p>
<p>removing the Republican Guard and the force that was in place. It was not capable of </p>
<p>securing a country.” </p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>The end of combat operations</b></p>
<p><b>459. </b> Mr Blair made a statement to the House of Commons on 14 April, reporting that </p>
<p>“less than four weeks” from the outset of the conflict “the regime of Saddam is gone, </p>
<p>the bulk of Iraq is under Coalition control and the vast majority of Iraqis are rejoicing </p>
<p>at Saddam’s departure”.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Blair continued: “Whatever the problems following Saddam’s collapse – and </p>
<p>in the short term they are bound to be serious – let no-one be in any doubt: Iraq is a </p>
<p>better place without Saddam.” Mr Blair added: “British forces have performed in Iraq with </p>
<p>extraordinary skill, professionalism and compassion. We can be deeply proud of them.” </p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr Blair gave the House of Commons the following assessment of the situation </p>
<p>in Iraq:</p>
<p>“The South of Iraq is now largely under British control. The West is secure, and </p>
<p>in the major town of al-Qa’im fighting is diminishing. In the North, Kurdish forces </p>
<p>have retired from Kirkuk and Mosul, leaving US forces in control. US forces are in </p>
<p>and around Tikrit. They are meeting some resistance. But in essence, all over Iraq, </p>
<p>Saddam’s forces have collapsed. Much of the remaining fighting, particularly in </p>
<p>Baghdad, is being carried out by irregular forces. In Baghdad itself, the Americans </p>
<p>are in control of most of the city but not yet all of it.</p>
<p>“As is obvious, the problem is now the disorder following the regime’s collapse. </p>
<p>Some disorder, frankly, is inevitable. It will happen in any situation where a brutal </p>
<p>police state that for 30 years has terrorised a population is suddenly destroyed. </p>
<p>Some looting, too, is directed at specific regime targets, including hospitals that were </p>
<p>dedicated for the use of the regime. But it is a serious situation and we need to work </p>
<p>urgently to bring it under control.” </p>

<p>85</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Mr Iain Duncan Smith, the Leader of the Opposition, congratulated Mr Blair for </p>
<p>the “heavy burden” that he had carried and added, “but he will have been comforted </p>
<p>throughout by the conviction that he was doing the right thing for Britain and for the rest </p>
<p>of the world”.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Scarlett informed the 16 April Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq, chaired by Mr Prescott, </p>
<p>that organised Iraqi resistance had ceased.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> The threat to Coalition Forces was from </p>
<p>paramilitaries, concentrated particularly in Baghdad. In the North, there was the potential </p>
<p>for inter-ethnic clashes.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Adm Boyce stated that military operations were directed at confronting terrorism, </p>
<p>mainly from foreign volunteers. The US was reducing its armoured presence in </p>
<p>Baghdad. In Basra and the South, normalisation continued with increased policing </p>
<p>and the population returning to work. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Prescott said that it was important to continue to </p>
<p>improve conditions for Iraqis. There were questions about the number of troops still on </p>
<p>standby for fire-fighting duties arising from the “upcoming proposition to replace British </p>
<p>military units now in Iraq with others from the United Kingdom”. He would take forward </p>
<p>discussions with Mr Hoon before reporting to Mr Blair. </p>

<p><b>the scale and nature of the UK contribution were the key factors in securing </b></p>

<p><b>senior UK officers who were able to work closely with the US chain of command </b></p>
<p><b>is likely to have been one of the most important determinants of influence on </b></p>
<p><b>operational matters.</b></p>
<p><b>472.  Overall, however, the plan and its implementation reflected US decisions and </b></p>
<p><b>priorities. </b></p>
<p><b>473.  While the evidence does not suggest it was the determining factor </b></p>
<p><b>in the choices made by the UK Government about the forces deployed for </b></p>
<p><b>military operations in Iraq, the likelihood of influencing US decisions should </b></p>
<p><b>not be overstated. In any future consideration of the UK contribution to any </b></p>
<p><b>US-led operation where the scale and nature of that contribution is essentially </b></p>
<p><b>discretionary, as it was in Iraq the UK should be more realistic about what can </b></p>
<p><b>be achieved. </b></p>
<p><b>474.  In addition, for success, clarity is required about: </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the objectives to be sought; </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>their importance to the UK national interest; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>how they are to be achieved. </b></p>
<p><b>475.  The UK’s desire and ability to influence the US military timetable and wider </b></p>
<p><b>strategic choices about the use of military force, including whether conditions </b></p>
<p><b>identified by the UK had been met, are addressed in Sections 3.1-3.8.</b></p>
<p><b>476.  The UK influence on US thinking at the early stages of the development of </b></p>
<p><b>the campaign plan for an invasion of Iraq in the summer and early autumn of 2002, </b></p>
<p><b>and in particular the need for a second, northern axis, is addressed in Section 6.1.</b></p>
<p><b>477.  The other evidence available does not enable the Inquiry to make a </b></p>
<p><b>considered judgement about specific issues on which the UK successfully </b></p>
<p><b>influenced US decisions. </b></p>
<p><b>478. </b> On 14 March 2003, Adm Boyce described the final campaign plan as “designed by </p>
<p>the US, although it has been, and continues to be, influenced by UK officers embedded </p>
<p>in the various relevant US and Coalition headquarters”.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>479. </b> In his National Contingent Commander’s report, dated 8 May, AM Burridge judged </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“Embedding staff in HQ CENTCOM allowed the UK to exercise significant influence </p>
<p>and maintained a very nimble information flow.” </p>

<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>480. </b> On 30 May, PJHQ concluded that the UK “decision action cycle was slower and </p>
<p>less well informed than it needed to be”.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> Differences in US and UK structures had </p>
<p>contributed to that. </p>
<p><b>481. </b> PJHQ recommended that influencing the US would best be achieved through </p>
<p>UK personnel developing strong personal links – and leverage – in US headquarters, </p>
<p>including co-locating the UK Joint Commander with the US Combined Forces Command </p>
<p>in all future operations, maintaining “permanent liaison in strength with CENTCOM”, and </p>
<p>establishing an “early UK presence with other Combatant Commands in the build up to </p>
<p>an operation”. </p>
<p><b>482. </b> PJHQ also concluded that the UK had “had a great deal of influence over the </p>
<p>conduct of the air campaign at the operational/tactical level”. </p>
<p><b>483. </b> Influence at the strategic level had, however, been “reduced by the different US </p>
<p>and UK C2 [command and control] systems”, where US political direction went direct to </p>
<p>General Franks rather than through the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> PJHQ recommended that the differences between the UK and US military </p>
<p>structures had to be recognised and the UK should review what had been achieved and </p>
<p>how best the UK might influence future US campaign plans.</p>
<p><b>485. </b> In October, Maj Gen Brims wrote in his post-operation report that the UK had </p>
<p>influenced the US only at the tactical level, although the deployment of AM Burridge </p>
<p>had gone some way to ensuring influence at Lt Gen McKiernan’s level.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>486. </b> In a report dated 17 October, the DOC judged that “the provision of Liaison Officers </p>
<p>in key locations in the US military chain of command played a significant role in securing </p>
<p>a degree of influence with the US”.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>487. </b> The DOC concluded:</p>
<p>“The UK must maintain the means of influencing the policy, planning and conduct of </p>
<p>a campaign in a Coalition context, specifically with the US, at an early enough stage </p>
<p>to have an effect.”</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burridge told the Inquiry that the decision to compress </p>
<p>the timing of the air campaign to coincide with the land campaign had been taken </p>
<p>to allow the Coalition to deal with the strategic risks simultaneously, and the UK had </p>
<p>encouraged that.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>489. </b> In the context of a question about planning for Phase IV, Sir Brian questioned </p>
<p>whether the MOD had achieved wider influence:</p>
<p>“I just don’t think they [the MOD] could get strategic traction. I don’t think the </p>
<p>machinery of government … was in a shape, phase or form that they could get </p>
<p>traction. </p>
<p>“I know that the nature of the way in which the US … ran an operation was different </p>
<p>… so the endless dialogue that we could have with the Joint Staffs in the Pentagon </p>
<p>which allowed us to grapple and influence … I perhaps wouldn’t go so far as to say </p>
<p>it wasn’t available, but it was made very much more difficult.” </p>
<p>315</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>490. </b> General Sir John Reith told the Inquiry that he had made the point to Gen Franks </p>
<p>that it would be essential to secure the oilfields rather than have them destroyed, </p>
<p>and that the phasing of the plan had subsequently been revised to include an early </p>
<p>land entry.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>491. </b> Gen Reith considered that it was the UK’s niche capabilities and US respect for </p>
<p>UK “staffing” that gave it influence, rather than the number of UK forces.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>492. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“So far as influence is concerned … there is no doubt in my mind anyway that to </p>
<p>produce something of a divisional size force rather than a brigade size force would </p>
<p>give us influence with the Americans in what was going on, not just in Iraq but also in </p>
<p>other relationships as well … I believe we did have influence. It forced the Americans </p>
<p>to go down the UN route … It certainly involved … at the tactical level, quite a lot </p>
<p>of shaping of tactics which we were able to influence and which I can’t give you </p>
<p>the detail of … [A] number of our commanders … at quite a junior level – would get </p>
<p>traction in a way which they would not have done if we had not had a divisional size </p>
<p>contribution.</p>
<p>“… in terms of targeting … We shaped quite a lot of the American thinking …</p>
<p>“… It allowed me to pick up the phone every day to talk to General Myers or </p>
<p>General Franks.” </p>

<p>89</p>
<p><b>493. </b> In its report on the lessons of the conflict, published in March 2004, the House of </p>
<p>Commons Defence Committee concluded that it was:</p>
<p>“… not … able to define the areas in which the British made specific contribution to </p>
<p>what was essentially an American campaign plan, other than in the consideration of </p>
<p>the northern option and in niche capabilities such as special forces operations.” </p>
<p>319</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>494. </b> The Defence Committee concluded that there was: </p>
<p>“… clear evidence of UK influence on the air targeting operations … Principally this </p>
<p>influence seems to have been applied to issues of perception … The extent to which </p>
<p>the UK persuaded the US out of attacking certain targets on grounds of principle is </p>
<p>less clear. We asked MOD for specific examples of UK influence but they failed to </p>
<p>provide any, even on a classified basis.” </p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>495. </b> In the context of the US system in which the deployed commander reports directly </p>
<p>to the Secretary of Defense, the Defence Committee recommended that the MOD </p>
<p>should consider: </p>
<p>“… whether the highest levels of British command structures might be made more </p>
<p>adaptable … to operate more closely with their American counterparts …”</p>
<p><b>496. </b> The Government response stated that the MOD believed “that the contribution </p>
<p>made by UK officers was influential in the overall shape of the plan”. It specifically </p>
<p>identified the roles played by Lt Gen Reith, the CDS liaison officer in the Pentagon, and </p>
<p>Major General David Wilson, the Senior British Military Adviser within CENTCOM.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>497. </b> The Government also stated that it was:</p>
<p>“… sorry that the Committee has stated that we failed to provide them with examples </p>
<p>of UK influence. We provided … classified material at the time … The Committee did </p>
<p>not indicate … they were dissatisfied.” </p>
<p>322</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>498. </b> The Government did not agree that command structures should be adapted to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>The transition to post-conflict operations</b></p>
<p><b>499. </b> The expansion of the UK Area of Operations (AO) during conflict operations </p>
<p>and the final extent of the post-conflict UK Area of Responsibility (AOR) are shown on </p>
<p>Map 5 in Annex 4. </p>
<p><b>Definition and use of “Area of Operations” and “Area </b></p>
<p><b>of Responsibility”</b></p>
<p><b>Area of Operations (AO): </b>The UK military’s area of combat operations during the </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq (Phase III of the campaign). It is the term applied during conflict and, </p>
<p>in terms of time, space and force, is the area in which lethal force can be applied for </p>
<p>a designated period of time.</p>
<p><b>Area of Responsibility (AOR):</b> The term is usually applied in peace support operations. </p>
<p>In Iraq, it referred to the area of southern Iraq for which the UK military was responsible </p>
<p>during the post-conflict Occupation of Iraq (Phase IV of operations). </p>
<p>The two terms were not used consistently within the UK Government and were sometimes </p>
<p>applied interchangeably in the same document. </p>
<p><b>Phase IV military planning papers</b></p>
<p><b>500.  The transition from conflict (Phase III) to post-conflict (Phase IV) military </b></p>
<p><b>operations began as soon as Coalition troops started to occupy Iraqi territory. </b></p>
<p><b>501.  When that transition began there had been no systematic analysis of the </b></p>
<p><b>UK’s military or civilian capacity to fulfil its likely obligations in the South in a </b></p>
<p><b>range of different circumstances, including in a hostile security environment with </b></p>
<p><b>low levels of Iraqi consent. </b></p>
<p><b>502.  Mr Straw and Mr Hoon advised Mr Blair: </b></p>
<p><b>“The expectation is that UK forces would be responsible for a task focused on </b></p>
<p><b>Basra and other key military objectives in the south-east of Iraq, which could </b></p>
<p><b>include 20 percent of the Iraqi population.”</b></p>
<p><b>503.  Mr Blair sought further advice on the size of any UK sector, the duration of </b></p>
<p><b>the UK commitment and the exit strategy.</b></p>
<p><b>504. </b> The absence of contingency plans and preparations, and the assumptions which </p>
<p>shaped continuing discussions about the level and extent of the UK’s post-conflict </p>
<p>military and civilian deployment, are addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>91</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Adm Boyce’s Execute Directive, issued on 18 March and addressed in detail </p>
<p>earlier in this Section, directed Lt Gen Reith to “assume the UK Phase IV AO will be </p>
<p>centred on Basra”.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>506. </b> In line with the military plan approved by Mr Blair on 14 March, the Directive stated </p>
<p>that, to “assist the Coalition in a timely and successful Phase III and to help in shaping </p>
<p>Phase IV conditions in the UK AO”, Lt Gen Reith should exploit no further north than </p>
<p>an east – west line running 90km south of al-Kut, ending at a point 50km north-east </p>
<p>of al-Amara.</p>
<p><b>507. </b> The Directive also stated that it was Adm Boyce’s “current intent … that the UK </p>
<p>should aim to draw down its deployed force to medium scale within four months of </p>
<p>commencing offensive operations”. </p>
<p><b>508. </b> Mr Hoon and Mr Straw sent Mr Blair a joint minute on the UK military contribution </p>
<p>to post-conflict Iraq on 19 March.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p> It stated that, immediately after the invasion:</p>
<p>“The expectation is that UK forces would be responsible for a task focused on </p>
<p>Basra and other key military objectives in the south-east of Iraq, which could include </p>
<p>20 percent of the Iraqi population. This task is broadly proportionate to the size of </p>
<p>the UK’s contribution to overall Coalition land forces …”</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon also advised that it would be necessary to reduce the </p>
<p>UK military contribution “to nearer a third by no later than the autumn in order to avoid </p>
<p>long-term damage to the Armed Forces” and to remain within current defence planning </p>
<p>assumptions. Scaling down to nearer a third would limit the UK contribution thereafter </p>
<p>to “a maximum of around one brigade, a two-star [divisional] headquarters and possibly </p>
<p>a contribution to higher level command and control”. They recommended telling the US </p>
<p>now, for planning purposes, that this was the upper limit of the UK contribution.</p>
<p><b>510. </b> The joint minute and the subsequent discussion and correspondence are </p>
<p>described in more detail in Section 6.5. This Section identifies only the high level points </p>
<p>in relation to possible UK command of a military sector.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Before the joint minute from Mr Straw and Mr Hoon reached No.10, Mr Drummond </p>
<p>advised Mr Rycroft that “we need Ministers to decide on sectors”.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p> He suggested that </p>
<p>they would want to agree the proposals in the joint minute:</p>
<p>“… provided they are satisfied that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK forces will be capable of providing security for an area around Basra </p>
<p>including about 20 percent of Iraq’s population.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How long we will have this responsibility, and what is the exit strategy (benign </p>
<p>security environment created, UK forces replaced by others). Will we be able </p>
<p>to limit ‘our area’ to say Basra by the autumn, when we want to withdraw two </p>
<p>thirds of our troops?”</p>
<p><b>512. </b> After the Ministerial meeting on post-conflict issues on 21 March, Mr Rycroft </p>
<p>informed the FCO and MOD that Mr Blair agreed to the recommendations made by </p>
<p>Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, subject to further urgent advice on the size of any UK sector, </p>
<p>the duration of the UK commitment and the exit strategy.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>513.  Treasury officials advised Mr Brown that the minute from Mr Straw to </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Hoon raised a number of issues, including that Treasury and MOD views </b></p>
<p><b>differed on the wisdom of the UK taking on command of a sector in Iraq without </b></p>
<p><b>“the necessary guarantees”. </b></p>
<p><b>514. </b> Mr John Dodds, Head of the Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence Team in the </p>
<p>Treasury, sent advice on the Straw/Hoon joint minute to Mr Brown on 24 March.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>515. </b> Mr Dodds told Mr Brown that US military planning appeared:</p>
<p>“… to have four ‘two-star commands (ie divisions)’ outside of Baghdad, focusing </p>
<p>more flexibly on the tasks that need to be done, rather than being tied down to </p>
<p>specific narrow locations.</p>
<p>“The MOD ambition is to have a UK-led ‘two-star [Maj Gen] command.’ </p>
<p><b>516. </b> Mr Dodds warned that the UK should not be too ready to take on a two-star </p>
<p>command in the aftermath without “the necessary guarantees”. The military would </p>
<p>“baulk” at this: “a ‘two-star command’ would provide a seat at the top table in the </p>
<p>aftermath”, but it carried the risk of costs “we cannot afford both militarily and financially”. </p>
<p><b>517.  The FCO advised that it would not be possible to decide on the size of a </b></p>
<p><b>UK military sector before establishing the nature of the task and the scale of the </b></p>

<p><b>518.  The relationship between the size of a military sector and the wider </b></p>
<p><b>contingent liabilities, including the impact on potential UK civilian responsibility </b></p>
<p><b>for administration and reconstruction, was not addressed.</b></p>
<p><b>519. </b> On 25 March, the FCO sent its response to Mr Blair’s request for further advice </p>
<p>on the size of a UK sector, the duration of the UK commitment and the exit strategy.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>520. </b> The FCO advice, agreed with the MOD and copied to DFID and the Treasury, </p>
<p>reflected much of Mr Dodds’ advice to Mr Brown.</p>
<p><b>521. </b> On the size of the UK sector, the FCO wrote:</p>
<p>“… we need to determine in the first instance the nature of the military task, and </p>
<p>make an assessment of the UK and other Coalition resources likely to be available. </p>
<p>Only then can we answer the question about geographical coverage. If the task is </p>
<p>to promote a secure environment, the size of the area will depend on the number of </p>
<p>troops that are available and the attitude of the Iraqis. The expectation is that Basra, </p>
<p>and the area around it, linked to existing administrative boundaries, should be the </p>
<p>focus. Plans need to remain flexible until we are able to define the task and confirm </p>
<p>the attitude of the population. US thinking appears to have moved away from too </p>
<p>early definition of ‘sectors’ for exactly the reasons explained above.”</p>
<p><b>522. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“We took the decision to take on responsibility for the South sector, following </p>
<p>Jack Straw and Geoff Hoon’s joint note to me of 19 March. This was the inevitable </p>
<p>outcome of the decision that our military contribution should be through the South. </p>
<p>I was also keen that this be our Area of Operation because it seemed clear that the </p>
<p>South would be more manageable. The South – Shia and heavily anti-Saddam – </p>
<p>was likely to be relatively supportive. And to begin with, this was indeed the case. </p>
<p>It was agreed that we should do it, without demur, as I recall.”</p>
<p><b>523.  Lt Gen Reith warned the Chiefs of Staff on 21 March that there were already </b></p>
<p><b>signs that pre-conflict assumptions about the nature and duration of the conflict </b></p>
<p><b>had been wrong, with implications for Phase IV planning. </b></p>
<p><b>524.  Lt Gen Reith advised that the Coalition “must be prepared” for high, medium </b></p>

<p><b>525. </b> Lt Gen Reith produced an update on Phase IV planning for the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 21 March.</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> He warned that Phase IV delivery remained subject to “uncertain </p>
<p>US dynamics at the pol/mil [politico-military] level”. US planning continued, but was </p>
<p>“primarily bottom-up”, and CFLCC was still seeking guidance on key issues including </p>
<p>governance, payment of salaries and “regeneration” of the military.</p>

<p>Coalition partners and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) looked like taking </p>
<p>longer. All this added pressure. Lt Gen Reith listed a number of issues needing </p>
<p>resolution, pointing out that some were already well known. They included: the system </p>
<p>of governance under Phase IV(b); how to approach Security Sector Reform (SSR); </p>
<p>provision of salaries to Iraqis; and how to engage the Iraqi military and judiciary. </p>
<p><b>527. </b> On “military realities”, Lt Gen Reith stated: “The Coalition must be prepared for </p>
<p>high/medium/low consent and variations thereof in time and space, including asymmetric </p>
<p>attack and intra-factional violence.” He listed “How to deal with non-compliance” as one </p>
<p>of the “key issues requiring resolution”. </p>
<p><b>528.  The draft Operational Concept for Phase IV prepared by Lt Gen Reith on </b></p>
<p><b>25 March:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>provided broad estimates of force requirements based on an expectation </b></p>
<p><b>of growing popular consent in the South;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>anticipated that the US would ask the UK to assume responsibility for four </b></p>

<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>cautioned that growing consent was dependent on a number of factors, </b></p>
<p><b>including improvement to the quality of life for Iraqis;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>highlighted the critical importance of an authorising Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>resolution and early bilateral UK engagement with potential force </b></p>

<p><b>529. </b> On 25 March, two UK military planning papers for Phase IV were sent to the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff: a draft Operational Concept and draft Phase IV military planning guidance.</p>
<p><b>530. </b> The draft Operational Concept for Phase IV, submitted by Lt Gen Reith, stated that:</p>
<p>“An enduring, operational level, concept is required to provide clarity and direction </p>

<p>of ways.” </p>

<p>95</p>
<p><b>531. </b> The draft listed six constraints on UK military planning resulting from unresolved </p>
<p>elements in pre-invasion preparation:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was unlikely to be a Security Council mandate for Phase IV in place for </p>
<p>several weeks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in the absence of a mandate, military operations would “in varying degree, be </p>
<p>both directed and constrained by the Hague and Geneva Conventions”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an uncertain strategic context that was likely to change over time;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the duration and impact of war-fighting would set the conditions in which Phase </p>
<p>IV would begin;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for the operational design to be “broadly consistent with the US </p>
<p>approach”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for force levels to “conform to endorsed scales of effort”. There was </p>
<p>“a recognised need for additional forces in Iraq to secure ground already </p>
<p>taken, show Iraq-wide Coalition presence and provide CFLCC with operational </p>
<p>flexibility”. The US planned a significant uplift in combat power, but not for a </p>
<p>month.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> The draft listed 10 “key deductions”:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>The strategic context to the operation lacks certainty. Internationalisation is likely </p>
<p>to be slow as nations take a view on the likelihood of overall success before </p>
<p>committing themselves.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>The operational design must be sufficiently flexible to remain coherent within </p>
<p>an ill-defined strategic context which is likely to change.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>The posture and disposition of US and UK forces when combat operations are </p>
<p>complete or when a surrender is concluded will be uncertain.</p>
<p>d. </p>
<p>On completion of combat, forces will be located in areas of operations for which </p>
<p>they will have legal and military responsibilities which cannot be relinquished </p>
<p>until handed over to a relieving force.</p>
<p>e. </p>
<p>CFLCC will adjust force dispositions on completion of Phase III and establish </p>
<p>an Iraq-wide Coalition presence. The Coalition will be thinly spread and the UK </p>
<p>will be expected to take its share of the risk/burden in order to establish a safe </p>
<p>and secure environment.</p>
<p>f. </p>
<p>On completion of Phase III, UK forces will be allocated an AOR within which the </p>
<p>legal and other obligations of an Occupying Power must be met. The AOR may </p>
<p>not necessarily be contiguous from the outset, but we should aim for this as </p>
<p>soon as possible.</p>
<p>g. </p>
<p>If there is no effective governance in place, forces will have responsibilities for </p>
<p>co-ordinating, and in some cases delivering, many aspects of life in Iraq.</p>
<p>h. </p>
<p>The military role in support of the civil sector could be prolonged.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>i. </p>
<p>In Iraq the provincial level provides the link between central government and </p>
<p>local administration. Military boundaries should be coterminous with provincial </p>
<p>boundaries, which will, in turn, define an AOR.</p>
<p>j. </p>
<p>There may be a need for more rather than less Coalition Forces in the short </p>
<p>term, depending on the nature of the outcome of Phase III and the level of </p>
<p>consent established as a result. The US will have no further formations available </p>
<p>until late April.”</p>
<p><b>533. </b> The draft recommended that “the operational design [of Phase IV] should be </p>
<p>predicated on the empowerment of Iraqi institutions and mechanisms of governance </p>
<p>appropriately supported by international military and other organisations”. That concept, </p>
<p>known as the Joint Commission (JC) approach, was recommended as:</p>
<p>“… a proven and familiar model enabling effective civil-military crisis co-ordination. </p>
<p>It allows the military to exercise authority and influence, yet promotes and fosters </p>
<p>a sense of civilian ownership in the decision-making process. Initially the military </p>
<p>would lead on a JC pulling together local authorities and other organisations </p>
<p>including Iraqi military where feasible, into a single decision-making body. At lower </p>
<p>levels, liaison teams mirror the function of the JC providing province-wide ‘ground </p>
<p>truth’ and a focus for military advice and support to the civil authorities. The JC </p>
<p>structure also provides the information to allow IO [international organisations]/NGO </p>
<p>to feel secure and target need. At an appropriate time the JC lead would transition </p>
<p>to the civil authorities, with the military adopting a supporting role.” </p>
<p><b>534. </b> Plans for SSR were “undetermined”. The draft recommended that the Coalition </p>
<p>“should attempt to retain as much of the Iraqi Regular Army intact as possible”. </p>
<p><b>535. </b> On levels of Iraqi consent, the draft stated:</p>
<p>“The extended UK ‘box’ for Phase III extends north into Wasit province. We should </p>
<p>anticipate that the US will ask the UK to assume responsibility for this province, as </p>
<p>well as those to the south – Basra, Dhi Qar, Maysan. All are predominantly Shia </p>
<p>and are generally not pro-regime. However, varying internal and external influences </p>
<p>determine the overall threat and level of consent.</p>
<p>“Anti-Coalition sentiment is predicted as low in all provinces. However, in the </p>
<p>immediate post-conflict period, UK forces could become involved in peace </p>
<p>enforcement operations between opposing factions. Internal tensions are greatest </p>
<p>in Wasit and probable in Maysan and Dhi Qar. Basra should be the easiest </p>
<p>province to govern.”</p>
<p><b>536. </b> The threat assessment for each of the four provinces was set out in an Annex, </p>
<p>the accuracy of which would be “determined by the nature of the conflict, adjusted by </p>
<p>a continuous assessment of risk”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>537. </b> For Wasit, Maysan and Dhi Qar provinces, the Annex stated that revenge and </p>
<p>retribution against the regime “could be high”. In Wasit it would represent “a sizeable </p>
<p>internal security issue”; in Maysan and Dhi Qar, a “short-term internal security issue”. </p>
<p>The section on Basra province stated:</p>
<p>“There will be some Iranian influence as the province shares a border with Iran … </p>
<p>Many tribes have been involved in anti-regime activities and, therefore, may be </p>
<p>pro-Western … Basra should be the most stable of the provinces in terms of threat </p>
<p>environment, but the size of the population will bring its own inherent problems.”</p>
<p><b>538. </b> The draft Operational Concept listed the military tasks for Phase IV, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining a safe and secure environment; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting enforcement of the rule of law; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting humanitarian assistance and reconstruction; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the interim civil administration; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping with the restoration of communications infrastructure; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the transformation of Iraq’s armed forces. </p>
<p><b>539. </b> The draft provided broad estimates of force requirements, based on expected </p>
<p>levels of popular consent in each province.</p>
<p><b>540. </b> The draft assessed the impact of factors affecting the military tasks: </p>
<p>“UK Capability … assuming internal tensions are high, initial operations are likely to </p>
<p>involve a continuous effort to preserve and maintain a consensual framework. This </p>
<p>will potentially require a brigade level of command for each province. At the present </p>
<p>scale of effort the UK has the capacity to do this, accepting some operational risk, </p>
<p>but at prejudice to our ability to reduce force levels in the short term …</p>
<p>“Iraqi Reactions. As internal tensions subside, consent in Iraq will grow dependent </p>
<p>on confidence in the US inspired IIA [Iraqi Interim Authority], engagement of </p>
<p>local Iraqi governance and growth of HA [Humanitarian Assistance]/immediate </p>
<p>reconstruction to improve the quality of life. The Iraqi population must also be </p>
<p>convinced that our presence is temporary. There is a direct link to our exit strategy </p>
<p>here; as consent in Iraq increases, force levels decrease. </p>
<p>“Expanding the Coalition. Even if a UNSCR is secured in good time, we will enter </p>
<p>Phase IV with few, if any, additional Coalition partners. Moreover IO and NGO </p>
<p>support is unlikely to be operating at full capability. This reinforces the critical </p>
<p>importance of an authorising UNSCR, allowing the wider internationalisation of our </p>
<p>presence in Iraq, and early bilateral engagement by the UK with potential force </p>
<p>contributors. In the medium term the UK may have to be prepared to bridge the gap </p>
<p>in force levels, maintaining a larger presence over a longer period of time than we </p>
<p>would wish …</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>“Engagement with US. The UK has no option but to use UK forces initially committed </p>
<p>to Phase III for Phase IV. However, accepting our intention to draw down to below </p>
<p>medium scale as rapidly as possible – which must be balanced against achieving </p>
<p>our wider political objectives in Iraq – the issue of UK responsibilities in Phase </p>
<p>IV needs to be concluded with the US. The UK would wish to concentrate in one </p>
<p>area of Iraq for ease of command and control and logistic support, this division </p>
<p>of responsibility has yet to be agreed formally. Agreement to an AOR would allow </p>
<p>planning for Phase IV to be taken forward in confidence.”</p>
<p><b>541. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were “invited to agree that:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>Our linkage with the Iraqis should reflect their system of governance and should </p>
<p>thus be arranged on a provincial basis.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>UK forces should use the Joint Commission model.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>Forces should be deployed on an intelligence-led rather than framework basis …</p>

<p><b>543. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit commented on the reference to Wasit province in the draft </p>

<p><b>548.  Lt Gen Pigott recommended preparing a strategic estimate for sustaining a </b></p>
<p><b>large-scale UK presence to March 2004.</b></p>
<p><b>549. </b> The second paper sent to the Chiefs of Staff on 25 March was Lt Gen Pigott’s draft </p>
<p>Phase IV military planning guidance.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Lt Gen Pigott stated that the MOD approach to Phase IV planning (“integration of </p>
<p>top down policy/strategic issues with bottom up operational/tactical realities”) “has kept </p>
<p>us reasonably balanced in a very uncertain environment”.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> With Phase IV “potentially </p>
<p>unfolding from now on”, it was time to take stock and update UK military commanders </p>
<p>and staff. </p>
<p><b>551. </b> The guidance outlined the wider strategic context for Phase IV, including the UK’s </p>
<p>post-conflict objectives and six “Strategic Lines of Operation”: disarmament, security, </p>
<p>humanitarian effort, political (initial governance and longer-term reconstruction of political </p>
<p>institutions), diplomatic and economic. </p>
<p><b>552. </b> Lt Gen Pigott summarised the US framework for Phase IV:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IVa (stability), lasting 6, 12 or 18 months under best, moderate or worst </p>
<p>case scenarios;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IVb (recovery), 18 to 24 months;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IVc (transition), from 24 months.</p>
<p><b>553. </b> He explained that US command and control for Phase IV was “a very fluid area”, </p>
<p>had gone through a number of iterations and could be expected to change further.</p>
<p><b>554. </b> Lt Gen Pigott advised that the scale of the UK military effort in Phase IV would be:</p>
<p>“Informed by operational considerations in the JOA [Joint Operational Area], such as </p>
<p>levels of consent but also taking account of wider Commitments, we need to draw </p>
<p>down to nearer medium scale of effort by autumn 03.” </p>
<p><b>555. </b> Lt Gen Pigott explained that the UK distinguished between three levels of consent: </p>
<p>“High”, “Medium (Patchy)” and “Low”. These mirrored the US model of best, moderate </p>
<p>and worst case scenarios. Current UK thinking assumed “medium (patchy) consent </p>
<p>turning to high as the basis for Phase IV planning at this stage but recognises that there </p>
<p>will be areas where low consent is more likely, possibly for some time.”</p>

<p>100</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Lt Gen Reith listed six components of the UK military’s approach to Phase IV:</p>
<p>“ a. Phase IV UK Strategy. While our Phase IV contribution will be governed largely by </p>
<p>immediate events in theatre, it is essential that our Phases IVb/c contribution is set </p>
<p>within a wider ‘Ends’ driven strategy …</p>
<p>b. Improved International Support. We need to create the conditions for improved </p>
<p>international engagement for Phase IV. An outline strategy has already been </p>
<p>developed for this … While looking for early support in Phase IVa we should not </p>
<p>make premature assumptions that it will be easily forthcoming.</p>
<p>c. Early Reduction. (May/Jun 03 tbc). We should identify and be prepared to </p>
<p>withdraw at speed (tbc) any capabilities which have Phase III utility only …</p>
<p>d. Staged Draw Down. (Jun–Sep 03 tbc). We should then plan to draw down the </p>
<p>balance of components to the autumn 03 steady state against clear criteria.</p>
<p>e. Enduring Steady State. (Sep 03–Mar 05). Subsequently, we should be prepared </p>
<p>to maintain the steady state until at least Spring 04 and scope out to Spring 05.</p>
<p>f. Branch Planning. A strategic estimate should be conducted to consider large scale </p>
<p>presence continuing through Mar 04 reducing then to medium scale until Mar 05.” </p>
<p><b>557. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit commented on the draft Phase IV military planning guidance:</p>
<p>“Creeping larger commitment. I am not clear where the idea of a large scale force </p>
<p>until April 04 comes from – as distinct from large scale until the autumn.” </p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>558. </b> It is not clear to whom Sir Kevin addressed his comments, but he was present </p>
<p>when the paper was discussed by the Chiefs of Staff on 26 March.</p>

<p><b>564. </b> Mr Drummond briefed Sir David Manning that the Chiefs of Staff discussion had:</p>

<p>the need to consider longer term military options. The Chiefs are still determined </p>

<p>339</p>
<p><b>565. </b> Admiral Sir Alan West, Chief of the Naval Staff and First Sea Lord, commented on </p>
<p>the draft Operational Concept on 27 March. He registered concern about “mission creep </p>

<p>and requested a discussion in a COS(I) [Chiefs of Staff (Informal)] meeting after a </p>
<p>regular meeting of the Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>566. </b> On 28 March, Gen Jackson commented that some of the assumptions in the draft </p>
<p>Operational Concept about levels of consent and the extent to which the UK could use </p>
<p>the remnants of the Iraqi administration “may have been optimistic”.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> The aspiration </p>
<p>to draw down to a divisional headquarters and one brigade remained, but “the situation </p>

<p>significantly in excess of ‘a medium scale effort by autumn 03’.” Although operational </p>
<p>conditions were likely to be different in each province, “it was likely that any extension of </p>

<p>shortfall in military forces for Phase IV and building a coalition to undertake some of </p>
<p>these operations is complicated by the absence of a UNSCR … You might want to </p>
<p>encourage MOD to share its thinking on force sizes, perhaps at COBR(R) initially, </p>
<p>once it has crystallised. In the meantime there is a danger of a rising expectation </p>

<p><b>The relationship between the UK military and ORHA</b></p>
<p><b>575.  In early April, Ministers were advised that ORHA was planning to administer </b></p>
<p><b>the whole of Iraq and it would therefore not be feasible for 1 (UK) Div to operate </b></p>
<p><b>autonomously in the UK AOR. </b></p>
<p><b>576.  Concerns were expressed about the implications, in those circumstances, </b></p>
<p><b>of differences between US and UK interpretations of the rights and obligations </b></p>
<p><b>of Occupying Powers. </b></p>
<p><b>577. </b> On 31 March, Mr Huw Llewellyn, an FCO Legal Counsellor, reported to </p>
<p>Mr Dominick Chilcott, Head of the Iraq Planning Unit (IPU), that UK military lawyers </p>
<p>based in Kuwait were becoming alarmed at ORHA’s activities.</p>

<p>customs laws, for which there was no clear legal authority. The position of UK forces, </p>
<p>if asked to participate in related activities, was therefore uncertain. </p>
<p><b>578. </b> Mr Llewellyn concluded:</p>
<p>“If it cannot be sorted out, we may well need a decision from Ministers about </p>
<p>whether UK forces should decline to take part in actions that we consider </p>
<p>unauthorised or unlawful.”</p>
<p><b>579. </b> The IPU sent recommendations on the UK’s future engagement with ORHA to </p>
<p>Mr Straw on 1 April.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>580. </b> The IPU advised that the UK objective of an Interim Iraqi Administration (IIA) acting </p>
<p>under UN authorisation was unlikely to be in place sooner than 90 days after the end of </p>
<p>hostilities.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> Until then, mechanisms were needed to deliver humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>and, within the relevant legal constraints, civil administration. Without such mechanisms, </p>
<p>those tasks would fall on the military, which had other priorities and limited resources. </p>
<p><b>581. </b> Because ORHA would administer the whole of Iraq as part of an integrated US-led </p>
<p>approach and had large resources at its disposal, it would not be viable for 1 (UK) Div to </p>
<p>operate “autonomously” in its AOR: </p>
<p>“We may wish to support 1 Div’s capacity to carry out specific actions (eg repairing </p>
<p>the water supply) in areas where we are responsible for maintaining security. </p>
<p>But the logic of ORHA – a nation-wide approach to Phase IV – limits the UK’s </p>
<p>responsibilities and exposure. Carving out a separate approach in a UK sector would </p>
<p>make no sense.”</p>
<p><b>582. </b> Depending on the circumstances, the UK could quite quickly be faced with “a grey </p>
<p>area of possible activities which could move ORHA beyond the UK’s understanding of an </p>
<p>Occupying Power’s rights and obligations”. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> The IPU concluded that, while ORHA was “in many ways a sub-optimal </p>
<p>organisation for delivering the UK’s Phase IV objectives”, it was “the only game in town”. </p>

<p>could cut across the UK Armed Forces’ so far successful ‘hearts and minds work’ </p>

<p><b>588. </b> Mr Lee briefed Mr Hoon on Phase IV issues on 2 April.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> He advised Mr Hoon to </p>
<p>note that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff had endorsed the draft Operational Concept on 31 March;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Joint Commission concept was well tested in the Balkans and would be </p>
<p>adapted to the particular circumstances of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>levels of consent and Phase IV tasks “remain undetermined and thus the </p>
<p>geographic scope of British responsibility cannot yet be decided”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>until ORHA’s plans were clearer, particularly in relation to future governance </p>
<p>structures, the relationship with ORHA needed to be managed “pragmatically </p>
<p>and without long-term commitment”.</p>
<p><b>589. </b> Mr Lee explained that:</p>
<p>“To a degree, initial ‘Phase IV’ operations have already begun in Iraq with </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance and low level civil contacts being conducted by UK forces. </p>
<p>There is thus a pressing need to define an operational concept for the employment </p>
<p>of UK forces in early Phase IV operations in Iraq …</p>
<p>“It is, however, early days. The strategic background to Phase IV operations remains </p>
<p>uncertain and changeable. Very significant decisions – eg about Iraqi governance </p>
<p>and the legal basis for Phase IV operations – remain to be taken. How any ‘Joint </p>
<p>Commissions’ will relate to Iraqi governance structures remains undecided: care </p>
<p>will be required that their establishment does not prejudge the development of </p>
<p>governance structures by ORHA. While acknowledging the merits of the ‘Joint </p>
<p>Commission’ model, we also need to be sympathetic to Iraqi culture and wishes. </p>
<p>Commanders on the ground are already implementing what has been called a ‘town </p>
<p>hall’ process. The key point is that ‘Joint Commissions’ should not become an alien </p>
<p>imposition or, in any way, a rival power base to an Interim Authority; their role should </p>
<p>be obviously temporary and advisory.</p>

<p>1 (UK) Div was the de facto authority in most of South-East Iraq, albeit </p>
<p>subordinate to the CFLCC, but the relationship between Maj Gen Brims and </p>
<p>ORHA was not clear; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the pressing tasks were “humanitarian and low-level administration (eg opening </p>

<p><b>591. </b> Mr Lee recommended that, in the light of indications that ORHA might soon move </p>

<p>Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec) and Mr William Ehrman, FCO </p>
<p>Director General Defence and Intelligence.</p>
<p><b>594. </b> Mr Hoon agreed to Mr Lee’s recommendations on 3 April, noting that the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff would “provide advice in due course on the geographical area that UK forces </p>
<p>should cover”.</p>

<p>ORHA during their conversation on 3 April.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>596. </b> Mr Hoon told Secretary Rumsfeld that the oil infrastructure in the South had been </p>
<p>secured with very little damage and it was possible that pumping would restart soon. </p>
<p>There was no reason why the Coalition could not leave Iraq in a better state than it </p>
<p>had found it, but he was “keen not to have British troops tied down in Iraq for too long”. </p>
<p>UK forces had made good contacts with local municipalities and were introducing the </p>
<p>well-tried concept of Joint Commissions. Mr Hoon suggested that ORHA should focus </p>
<p>on its humanitarian role and “go cautiously on the political/governmental dimension”.</p>
<p><b>Extension of the UK AO</b></p>
<p><b>597.  On 7 April, the Chiefs of Staff took the view:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>that the boundaries of any extension of the AO should be clearly defined;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>that the UK should not be over-committed; and</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>any move north should be dependent on the successful conclusion of </b></p>

<p><b>598.  On 11 April, the UK AO was extended to al-Amara in Maysan province.</b></p>
<p><b>599. </b> Lt Gen Reith circulated a revised draft Operational Concept on 4 April. The revised </p>
<p>text reflected comments made by the Chiefs of Staff on 31 March and was to be </p>
<p>approved out of committee if no further comments were received by 10 April.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The revised draft recommended that:</p>
<p>“Any extension of UK responsibility beyond Basra province should preferably be </p>
<p>achieved through support from Coalition partners, who would deploy forces to </p>
<p>operate under a UK two-star divisional HQ.”</p>

<p>considering the use of UK forces to secure the northern Rumaylah oilfields and </p>
<p>Route 6 (which ran north from Basra, through al-Amara (in Maysan province) and al-Kut </p>
<p>(in Wasit province) to Baghdad).</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> The Chiefs of Staff took the view that the boundaries </p>
<p>of any extension to the AO would need to be clearly defined; that the UK should not be </p>
<p>over-committed; and that any move north should be dependent on the successful </p>
<p>conclusion of operations in Basra. </p>

<p>provinces of Iraq during Phase IV.”</p>
<p><b>611. </b> On that basis, Mr Hoon was asked to agree that:</p>
<p>“ c) UK forces may exploit further north to take all of the Maysan province into the </p>
<p>UK Area of Operations, once al-Amara is secure, allowing GOC 1 Div to begin the </p>
<p>process of engaging local leaders in the same way as he has in Basra province and </p>
<p>allowing elements of [US] I MEF to be re-allocated to operations in Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Lt Gen Reith explained that:</p>
<p>“Given the current progress UK forces have made in Basra, with work beginning </p>
<p>to set up conditions for Phase IV, CJO believes that the time is right to be able to </p>
<p>release forces northwards … The US Task Force Tarawa has already explored </p>
<p>al-Amara and found that it had been self-liberated and [is] currently stable. </p>
<p>“Once this task is complete, we will wish to begin work to aid reconstruction of the </p>
<p>region. Secretary of State should note, that although a final agreement has not been </p>
<p>made on the number of provinces that the UK will support during Phase IV, CFLCC </p>
<p>has already asked CDS to take responsibility for both Basra and Maysan provinces. </p>
<p>Whilst the initial UK AO boundary made operational sense during war-fighting in </p>
<p>terms of co-ordination with the US, if the process of reconstruction is to start, it </p>
<p>makes sense to include the whole of Maysan province at the earliest opportunity. </p>
<p>This will allow locals to become exposed to UK forces, enabling the necessary </p>
<p>rapport and trust to be built up … </p>
<p>“Our assessment of this additional area is that it is relatively quiet and therefore </p>
<p>should not add any unmanageable burden on UK forces – the only real resistance </p>
<p>has been in al-Kut, further to the north-west. It is on this basis that we wish to seek </p>
<p>approval to extend the UK AO as far as the northern Maysan provincial border in </p>
<p>advance of any overt Phase IV activity.</p>
<p>“… we may be asked by the US to extend our Area of Responsibility to further </p>
<p>provinces in due course.”</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that the UK response to a US request to extend the UK’s </p>
<p>AOR would depend on the permissiveness of the areas concerned and the response </p>
<p>to requests for additional Coalition members to offer support during reconstruction. </p>
<p>The issue was being discussed by the Chiefs of Staff. Further advice would follow. </p>
<p><b>614. </b> Lt Gen Reith did not address directly the potential risks associated with expansion </p>
<p>to two provinces that had been raised during initial discussion of the extension of the UK </p>

<p> Mr Watkins wrote:</p>
<p>“This [US] approach is not, of course, entirely unexpected and Mr Hoon will wish to </p>

<p>“UK thinking … The current working assumption is that we should scale down </p>
<p>our contribution to a division HQ and a brigade, as soon as this is feasible, but by </p>
<p>September. This could then be maintained until spring 2004. Work is in hand now to </p>

<p>The aim should be for Coalition partners to be as self-sustaining as possible, but </p>

<p>the UK AOR should be “based on” Basra and Maysan provinces;</p>

<p>where possible, before the summer”. It remained the UK’s strategic intent “to draw down </p>
<p>to nearer a medium scale of effort – a Div[isional] HQ and a B[riga]de – by Autumn 03”, </p>
<p>sufficient to run two provinces, but there was a clear US expectation that the UK would </p>
<p>take responsibility for up to two more provinces “as the Coalition grows”. </p>
<p><b>626. </b> Lt Gen Reith warned that, without a UN mandate and with few nations able </p>
<p>to generate forces quickly, the UK “should not plan on substantial early Coalition </p>
<p>augmentation of UK resources”. He also advised that the level of Iraqi consent in the </p>
<p>South-East was “assumed to be medium (patchy) turning to high as Phase IV develops”, </p>
<p>but would be kept under review. A brigade of four battlegroups would be needed to </p>

<p><b>the UK AOR, all on the assumption that levels of consent would continue </b></p>
<p><b>to rise;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>recommended that the UK “should not assume responsibility for more </b></p>

<p><b>631. </b> Lt Gen Reith sent a first version of the SOR for a UK AOR to the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 15 April.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> He explained that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff had already been asked to agree that “the initial UK AOR” </p>
<p>should be “based on” Basra and Maysan provinces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>with the deployment of a divisional headquarters and the “probability of </p>
<p>additional Coalition troops”, the UK had the potential to expand the AOR to </p>
<p>include two other provinces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the additional provinces would probably be Dhi Qar and Wasit, but that had </p>
<p>not been agreed formally with Lt Gen McKiernan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK “should not plan on substantial early Coalition augmentation”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US had accepted that it should “hold the risk” in areas of potential UK </p>
<p>responsibility while waiting for the Coalition force to grow, but there was no </p>
<p>formal agreement with the US on the issue; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>initial discussions had begun with some countries, but all “desire to know where </p>
<p>they will be asked to operate and the forces required”. </p>
<p><b>632. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that the UK “should not assume responsibility for more than </p>
<p>two provinces until additional and appropriate Coalition Forces are deployed. This needs </p>
<p>formal US/UK agreement”.</p>
<p><b>633. </b> In the SOR, Lt Gen Reith set out estimated force requirements for Basra, Maysan </p>
<p>and the four other provinces that might be included in an extended UK AOR:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra: a brigade HQ and three battlegroups with appropriate integral Combat </p>
<p>Support (CS) and Combat Service Support (CSS);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maysan (grouped with Basra): a single battlegroup, supported by a Formation/</p>
<p>Light Reconnaissance (FR) Company;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Wasit: a brigade HQ and two battlegroups with appropriate CS and CSS;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dhi Qar: a brigade HQ and two battlegroups with appropriate CS and CSS;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Diyala: a brigade HQ and three battlegroups with appropriate CS and CSS;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Muthanna: a brigade HQ and one battlegroup supported by an FR Company </p>
<p>with appropriate CS and CSS.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> Lt Gen Reith explained that the SOR offered “a starting point for discussion with </p>
<p>potential troop contributing nations”. It was “early days”:</p>
<p>“… Coalition Forces do not yet fully control all areas in SE Iraq. Thus, the SOR may </p>
<p>change and we will need to remain flexible. Much will depend on detailed ground </p>

<p>113</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Lt Gen Reith recommended that there were “logistic advantages” in including </p>
<p>Dhi Qar as the third province if the UK AOR were expanded. Wasit and Muthanna </p>
<p>were the likely options for the fourth. Muthanna was “mostly desert … undemanding </p>
<p>and potentially unrewarding, although it includes the area of a potential oilfield”. It was </p>
<p>the “simpler task, requiring less troops”. Wasit was “more demanding, requires more </p>
<p>troops, but offers a significant role”. Lt Gen Reith advised that: “On the basis of logistic </p>
<p>complexity and concern over long term consent levels, Diyala is the only province of the </p>
<p>six that the UK should actively seek to avoid.” </p>
<p><b>636. </b> The SOR included one-page summaries of conditions in each of the six provinces, </p>
<p>including assessments of “residual threats” and level of consent:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Wasit. “A medium-term threat from small groups of irregulars will continue to </p>
<p>exist whilst they have any residual support from the local civilian population. </p>
<p>As the restructuring work post-war gains momentum and law and order and </p>
<p>governmental institutes begin to function again, expect this threat to diminish … </p>
<p><b>Low-High levels of consent</b>. Revenge and retribution between communities </p>
<p>potentially high; large Sunni population.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra. “Iranian-backed/influenced groups will continue to try to exert influence in </p>
<p>the region; this is expected to be a short- to medium-term threat. The extent of </p>
<p>threat from PMF [Popular Mobilisation Forces] will be influenced by the tolerance </p>
<p>of the community; as confidence in the Coalition’s presence builds this threat is </p>
<p>expected to diminish … <b>High level of consent</b>. Strong economy with potential </p>
<p>for rapid growth. Anti-regime. Border province – Iranian influence.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maysan. “Aside from small groups of irregulars, expect a relatively low level of </p>
<p>residual threat in this governorate. As for other areas, the ability of these groups </p>
<p>to continue to influence and to blend in with the civilian population will diminish </p>
<p>as the post-war reconstruction gathers momentum … <b>Medium-High levels of </b></p>
<p><b>consent</b>. Tensions between MEK [Mujahideen e Khalq] and local population </p>
<p>high. Border province – Iranian influence. Tribes are anti-regime.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dhi Qar. “Aside from small groups of irregulars, we expect a relatively low level </p>
<p>of residual threat in this governorate. As for other areas, the ability of these </p>
<p>groups to continue to influence and to blend in with the civilian population will </p>
<p>diminish as the post-war reconstruction gathers momentum … <b>Medium-High </b></p>
<p><b>levels of consent</b>. Poor region. Tribal insurrection since 1991. Tensions </p>
<p>between MEK and local population high.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Muthanna. “A largely benign area of Iraq which is sparsely populated and </p>
<p>bordered by Saudi Arabia. There is a possibility that the long-running border </p>
<p>dispute with the Saudis could re-emerge in the aftermath of the war, but this is </p>
<p>unlikely to pose a direct threat to Coalition activities. That aside, we assess that </p>
<p>there is no discernible threat, residual or otherwise to Coalition Forces … <b>High </b></p>

<p>camp is unknown. There is liable to be a degree of Iranian influence due to the </p>
<p>proximity of the border, but Shia does not dominate the ethnic mixture in this </p>
<p>region, thus any influence exerted by the Iranians will be limited. It is assessed </p>
<p>that there is no discernible residual threat to Coalition Forces … <b>Medium level </b></p>

<p><b>637. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the UK AOR on 15 April.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> Lt Gen Pigott stated </p>
<p>that it was anticipated that the UK would be asked to administer Basra and Maysan </p>
<p>provinces, “together with two-star supervision of two further provinces, probably Wasit </p>
<p>and Dhi Qar or Diyala”. </p>
<p><b>638. </b> Adm Boyce concluded that: “The potential requirement for the UK commitment </p>
<p>to extend to four provinces needed urgent clarification.”</p>
<p><b>639.  Sir David Manning was informed that, on the basis of emerging levels of </b></p>
<p><b>consent, the Chiefs of Staff believed that a divisional headquarters and a brigade </b></p>
<p><b>of four battlegroups could look after Basra and Maysan provinces and, subject </b></p>
<p><b>to Coalition support, supervise two additional provinces.</b></p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Bowen summarised the discussion for Sir David Manning:</p>
<p>“The general idea is to provide a divisional headquarters and a brigade (of four </p>
<p>battlegroups). On the basis of the emerging level of consent in southern Iraq, they </p>
<p>believe that this brigade could look after, in security terms, the provinces of Basra </p>
<p>and Maysan. The divisional headquarters would enable the British to supervise two </p>
<p>additional provinces, provided two brigades’ worth of troops (and two headquarters) </p>
<p>were made available by either the Americans or other Coalition partners …</p>
<p>“There was some debate about which other provinces it was reasonable to assume </p>
<p>security responsibility for … There was concern that the civilian boundaries of ORHA </p>
<p>might not coincide with those of the military structure … Some of this will become </p>
<p>clearer after Mr Hoon speaks to Mr Rumsfeld today.” </p>
<p>367</p>
<p><b>641. </b> The speaking note prepared for Mr Hoon’s conversation with Secretary Rumsfeld </p>
<p>suggested that Mr Hoon state:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>brigade in Iraq by July/August, if possible. Very difficult to imagine we could </p>
<p>offer more.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need clear understanding of envisaged requirement for July and beyond – </p>

<p>option, a number of fundamental questions needed urgent answers, including how the </p>

<p> The meeting included “a </p>
<p>lengthy discussion about the allocation of regions, provinces and sectors”. Gen Franks </p>
<p>and Adm Boyce agreed that, if at all possible, Iraqi regions, military sectors and ORHA </p>
<p>regions should be coterminous. </p>
<p><b>669.  Lt Gen Reith advised the Chiefs of Staff that many of the civilian tasks </b></p>
<p><b>emerging in the UK AOR were outside the normal competence of the military. </b></p>
<p><b>670.  He stated that there was a threat to the credibility of the UK if no </b></p>
<p><b>“overarching national direction” was given to non-military tasks.</b></p>
<p><b>671. </b> Lt Gen Reith took stock of Phase IV planning in a minute to the Chiefs of Staff and </p>
<p>MOD officials on 22 April.</p>
<p>381</p>
<p> With Phase III “war-fighting” being replaced in Phase IV by </p>
<p>“the requirement to administer Iraq in the broadest sense”, it was becoming clear that </p>
<p>many issues arising in the UK AO were “outside the normal competence of the MOD in </p>
<p>general and of PJHQ in particular”. </p>
<p><b>672. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised:</p>
<p>“The position in the UK AO is now sufficiently developed that direction is required </p>
<p>on a whole variety of Civil/Military affairs … As ORHA is not yet in a position to give </p>
<p>such direction, there is a significant risk that momentum will be lost, leaving the UK </p>
<p>vulnerable to charges that it has been unable to turn military success into coherent </p>
<p>governance. The implications for UK standing with the Iraqi population and the </p>
<p>international community, not to mention for the Prime Minister’s required exemplary </p>
<p>performance are potentially very serious.</p>
<p>“At present the MOD is the only UK government department actively engaged in </p>
<p>Iraq. It is clear … that many of the issues now facing Iraq in general and the UK AO </p>
<p>in particular, are not military tasks and sit more comfortably with other government </p>
<p>and non-government agencies. There is currently no overarching national direction </p>
<p>being applied to ensure such organisations are actively or usefully engaged to deal </p>
<p>with these issues …</p>
<p>“The Iraqi community is beginning to make it clear that it feels that the military has </p>
<p>completed its task. What they want now is long term non-military assistance in </p>
<p>rebuilding their infrastructure.”</p>

<p><b>674. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the size of the UK AOR on 22 April.</p>
<p>382</p>
<p> CENTCOM </p>
<p>was expected to respond to a UK request for clarification of the extent of the UK Phase </p>
<p>IV AOR by 26 April. It was likely to have Basra and Maysan provinces at its core, </p>
<p>together with Dhi Qar and Muthanna, an area coincident with an ORHA region. There </p>
<p>was also “a possibility that the UK’s success in attracting Coalition partners would result </p>
<p>in a fifth province being added”. </p>
<p><b>675. </b> Adm Boyce reiterated the importance of the boundaries of the UK AOR matching </p>
<p>an ORHA region, whatever the outcome. He also directed Lieutenant General </p>
<p>Andrew Ridgway, Chief of Defence Intelligence, to brief the Chiefs of Staff on “the key </p>
<p>geopolitical issues associated with each of the provinces within the potential UK AOR”.</p>
<p><b>676. </b> The DIS report on the provinces in the UK AOR was produced on 28 April and is </p>

<p>produce some surplus capability. Multilateral meetings were scheduled on 30 April and </p>
<p>8 May to take things forward. </p>
<p><b>680. </b> Mr Watkins advised that discussions with the US on the size of the UK AOR were </p>
<p>continuing:</p>
<p>“The US aspire for us to supervise an additional two provinces, probably Dhi Qar </p>
<p>and Muthanna (the latter now seems more likely than Wasit), although we have </p>
<p>stressed the need to ensure that our area is coterminous with an ORHA region. </p>
<p>Each additional province will need to be covered by a brigade headquarters, </p>
<p>although both provinces, in particular Muthanna, should be manageable with much </p>
<p>less than a full brigade’s worth of military capability.”</p>
<p><b>681. </b> Adm Boyce advised the 24 April meeting of the AHMGIR that the US planned to </p>
<p>divide Iraq into five sectors.</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> The UK would lead one sector, comprising four provinces </p>
<p>in south-eastern Iraq. That was “manageable … provided that other countries offered </p>
<p>troops to work with us”. The UK could take on a fifth province “if others contributed the </p>
<p>necessary forces for it”. The southern region of ORHA would follow the boundaries of </p>
<p>the UK’s sector. </p>
<p><b>682. </b> Ministers agreed that “the size of the UK military sector will depend on the </p>
<p>permissiveness of the environment and the extent of other nations’ contributions, but </p>
<p>the current assumption was that it would comprise four, or possibly five provinces in the </p>
<p>South”. The MOD was instructed to report progress at the next meeting.</p>
<p><b>683.  When Ministers endorsed the assumption that the UK AOR would comprise </b></p>
<p><b>four provinces coterminous with the southern region of ORHA, they did so against </b></p>
<p><b>the background of continuing concern about civilian-military co-ordination, </b></p>
<p><b>ORHA’s capabilities and the implications of both for the achievement of the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>objectives in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>684.  As Chief of the Defence Staff, it was Adm Boyce’s responsibility to ensure </b></p>
<p><b>that military advice on the UK AOR was based on robust analysis of the military’s </b></p>
<p><b>ability and capacity to meet the UK’s likely obligations to provide security and </b></p>
<p><b>maintain law and order in the South, taking full account of the wider strategic </b></p>
<p><b>implications and contingent liabilities. </b></p>
<p><b>685.  Adm Boyce’s advice to the AHMGIR on 24 April on the size of the UK AOR </b></p>
<p><b>was given at a time of considerable uncertainty in UK policy towards ORHA. It </b></p>
<p><b>is not clear that his advice took account of the possible impact on the military’s </b></p>

<p><b>decide to engage more actively in ORHA. </b></p>

<p>Commander Lieutenant General McKiernan, who were counting on the additional </p>
<p>manpower to provide a secure environment for post-conflict stabilization. The </p>
<p>reversal also dumbfounded McKiernan’s CFLCC staff, that had just sat through two </p>
<p>video conferences with senior Pentagon officials who had affirmed the decision to </p>
<p>continue deploying forces. [The Head of ORHA, US Lieutenant General (Retired) </p>

<p><b>699. </b> The DIS produced an assessment of Basra, Maysan, Dhi Qar, Muthanna and </p>
<p>Wasit provinces on 28 April.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> The paper stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the overwhelming majority of tribes welcomed the overthrow of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein, but some remained suspicious of Coalition intentions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was potential for inter-tribal conflict between pro- and anti-regime tribes, </p>
<p>but traditional tribal enmity in the UK AOR was “unlikely to be destabilising”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a number of religious leaders were vying for influence over the Shia population, </p>
<p>although most local clerics in the UK AOR were believed to be followers of </p>
<p>Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was strong evidence that Iranian-backed groups were attempting to </p>
<p>increase their influence in southern Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further outbreaks of violence were likely as Shia factions attempted to gain </p>
<p>political and social influence.</p>
<p><b>700. </b> The DIS advised that there was insufficient detail available for a complete picture </p>
<p>of Iraq infrastructure. It assessed that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Four airfields in the UK AOR, including Basra Airport, were being cleared of </p>
<p>obstructions; the remaining 16 would require “varying but significant effort” to </p>
<p>restore full operating capability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Major clearance operations were needed in the Shatt al-Arab waterway before </p>
<p>Basra would be available for major port operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Roads were “generally in good condition”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were no reports of damage to railways.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Telecommunications and broadcasting networks were in “various stages of </p>
<p>degradation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Little southern oil infrastructure had been damaged during Op TELIC, but most </p>
<p>facilities had ground to a halt.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Damage during the 1991 Gulf Conflict and subsequent lack of maintenance had </p>
<p>reduced electricity generation and transmission to 40–50 percent of capacity. </p>
<p>Power cuts continued to be “widespread and prolonged”. There might be </p>
<p>additional problems with transmission caused by conflict damage to power lines.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The water and sewerage system had been severely degraded by the Gulf </p>
<p>Conflict, poor maintenance and problems caused by sanctions; 60 percent of </p>
<p>the water distribution system for Basra had been restored, but sewage treatment </p>
<p>plants were “barely functioning”. It was doubtful that a reliable service could be </p>
<p>restored without “extensive investment of money, time and equipment”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Pre-conflict shortages of medical supplies had been aggravated by looting. </p>
<p>NGOs had restored stocks to most major hospitals, but there remained the </p>
<p>problem of persuading health professionals to return to their posts. </p>
<p><b>701. </b> Separate assessments of the five provinces provided more detail, but all with the </p>
<p>caveat that information on the region remained limited. Information on Muthanna and </p>
<p>Wasit provinces was particularly sparse. </p>
<p><b>702. </b> No assessment was made of the comparative advantage of including particular </p>
<p>provinces in the UK AOR.</p>
<p><b>703. </b> In a statement to Parliament on 30 April, Mr Hoon announced that:</p>
<p>“Decisive combat operations in Iraq are now complete, and Coalition Forces are </p>
<p>increasingly focusing upon stabilisation tasks. It will therefore be possible to make </p>
<p>further force level adjustments over the coming weeks while continuing to meet our </p>
<p>responsibilities to the Iraqi people.” </p>
<p>396</p>
<p><b>704. </b> In addition to the substantial withdrawal of Royal Navy and RAF personnel and </p>
<p>many of the Army war-fighting units, Mr Hoon explained that he had extended the tour </p>
<p>of one unit to enable it “to continue in their key role of ensuring security in the region of </p>
<p>Zubayr”. He concluded that:</p>
<p>“While details continue to be clarified, we envisage that by mid-May 25,000–30,000 </p>
<p>UK Service personnel will remain deployed in the Gulf region, continuing to fulfil our </p>
<p>responsibilities towards the Iraqi people. The planned replacement of forces is clear </p>
<p>evidence of our commitment to them.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to leave an Iraq that is confident, secure and fully integrated with the </p>
<p>international community. The planning process to establish the precise level of the </p>
<p>continuing UK presence needed to achieve this aim is a dynamic one, and is kept </p>
<p>under review. We will also need to take account of the contributions of Coalition </p>
<p>partners. We will continue to withdraw assets and personnel from the region </p>
<p>where possible, but we will maintain an appropriate military presence for as long </p>
<p>as necessary.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>717. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 12 June meeting of the AHMGIR advised that </p>
<p>security in the South remained fragile.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p> Iraqi frustration with the pace of progress </p>
<p>could cause the situation to deteriorate. The UK’s ability to “push the pace” would be </p>
<p>constrained by the reduction in UK military force strength following the transition to </p>
<p>3rd (UK) Mechanised Division in July. </p>
<p><b>718. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that the UK AO would expand to four provinces </p>
<p>at the end of July, to match the area of CPA(South), and that substantial Italian and </p>
<p>Dutch military forces were expected over the next four to six weeks.</p>
<p><b>719. </b> The meeting of the AHMGIR on 12 June also considered a joint DFID/MOD paper </p>
<p>entitled ‘UK Support to the CPA South Area – Next Steps’. The paper assessed that: </p>
<p>“CPA(South) is unable to deliver in terms of determining priority needs, overseeing </p>
<p>implementation, or supporting the political transition. There is a lack of vision; </p>
<p>CPA(South) is severely undermanned; and has almost no systems or resources in </p>
<p>place to deliver any tangible improvements soon. In consequence, 1 (UK) Div retains </p>
<p>almost all executive authority in the UK area of operations (AO). In turn, locals look </p>
<p>to the British military, not CPA(South), to address local problems. To the extent that </p>
<p>these functions are being carried out at present, it is due to the unstinting efforts </p>
<p>of 1 (UK) Div, the few UK secondees in the South, and, more importantly, the high </p>
<p>quality of the Iraqi counterparts they are working with.”</p>
<p><b>720. </b> At the meeting, Ministers noted that it had been decided that the UK area of </p>
<p>military operations would be expanded to cover four provinces (Muthanna, Dhi Qar, </p>
<p>Maysan and Basra), to match the area of CPA(South).</p>
<p>403</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>721.  Mr Straw, as Chair of the AHMGIR, the body responsible for determining </b></p>
<p><b>UK policy on post-conflict Iraq, should have ensured well before June that the </b></p>
<p><b>AHMGIR agreed a position on the UK’s AOR in Iraq that took full account of wider </b></p>
<p><b>strategic implications and contingent liabilities, and sought Mr Blair’s formal </b></p>
<p><b>endorsement of the AHMGIR’s conclusions. There is no indication that he did so. </b></p>
<p><b>722. </b> MND(SE) was established formally on 12 July.</p>
<p>404</p>
<p> Its creation coincided with the </p>
<p>handover from 1 (UK) Div to 3 (UK) Div.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> The boundaries of MND(SE) matched those of CPA(South).</p>

<p>127</p>
<p><b>724. </b> When asked exactly when the decision was made that the UK would take </p>
<p>responsibility for the South and who was involved in that decision, Mr Blair told the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… from January 2003 it was obvious – not obvious, sorry – it was agreed we </p>
<p>would be going in through the south … So we would be, as it were, with de facto </p>
<p>responsibility for that area. I think. Mike Jackson gave evidence to you which said </p>
<p>really in a sense our responsibility for the aftermath in that sector grew out of the fact </p>
<p>that this was our area of operations in the conflict. </p>
<p>“We then … had a meeting on 6 March … I didn’t resolve that finally then. </p>
<p>“There was then a Cabinet Office note of 19 March … saying, ‘We should decide on </p>
<p>sectors, and then a joint Foreign and Defence Secretary minute is coming to you …’</p>
<p>“So we didn’t take a final view then, but their note to me was, the expectation is the </p>
<p>UK forces would be responsible for a task focused on Basra. I then had that meeting </p>
<p>with them. </p>
<p>“On 21 March Matthew Rycroft then notes out to the Foreign Office and Ministry of </p>
<p>Defence: ‘The Prime Minister … agrees with the Foreign and Defence Secretaries’ </p>
<p>proposals, provided there is a satisfactory resolution’, and then I list certain issues.</p>
<p>“Then again the Foreign Office write to Matthew Rycroft, and then what happens is </p>
<p>that we establish at some point then the Ad Hoc Committee [the Ad Hoc Ministerial </p>
<p>Group on Iraq Rehabilitation], capital ‘A’, capital ‘H’ this time, with Jack Straw in </p>
<p>charge, and out of that comes the view we should be responsible for that sector </p>
<p>and this should be part of a joint Occupying Power and responsibility. I have to say, </p>
<p>though, it was always pretty obvious that’s where we would end up.” </p>
<p>405</p>
<p><b>725. </b> Asked whether, during that period, there had been a specific decision on taking </p>
<p>responsibility for the South, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“I think the specific decision ultimately was taken when we then got resolution 1483. </p>
<p>Most of the discussion here was not really about whether we should be responsible </p>
<p>for the South or not. It was about the UN role. Then what happened was there were </p>
<p>these Ad Hoc Committee meetings that Jack was chairing … They were going </p>
<p>through all this in an immense amount of detail, legal advice and so on. Peter </p>
<p>Goldsmith was on it. Then we got 1483, reported it to Cabinet and agreed it.” </p>

<p><b>726.  The UK military plan approved by Mr Blair on 14 March defined the UK’s </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>727.  Four months later, on 12 July, the UK assumed military responsibility for </b></p>
<p><b>four provinces.</b> </p>
<p><b>728.  For the next six years, the UK was responsible for maintaining security in </b></p>
<p><b>those provinces, initially as an Occupying Power and, from June 2004, in support </b></p>
<p><b>of the Iraqi Government.</b></p>
<p><b>729.  Sections 6.4 and 6.5 consider the reasons for the Government’s failure to </b></p>
<p><b>prepare a flexible, realistic and fully resourced post-conflict plan integrating UK </b></p>
<p><b>civilian and military resources in a single national effort. </b></p>
<p><b>730.  The process leading to the creation of the UK AOR followed that pattern, </b></p>
<p><b>even after the creation of the AHMGIR.</b></p>
<p><b>731.  Section 10.1 considers the impact of the AHMGIR in greater detail. </b></p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>732. </b> The military plan for the invasion of Iraq depended for success on a rapid advance </p>
<p>on Baghdad, including convincing the Iraqi population of the Coalition’s determination to </p>
<p>remove the regime. </p>
<p><b>733. </b> By the end of March, the Government had recognised the need for sustained </p>
<p>communication of key strategic messages and improved capabilities to reach a range of </p>
<p>audiences in the UK, Iraq and the wider international community. But there was clearly </p>
<p>a need for more robust arrangements to integrate Coalition efforts in the UK, US and </p>
<p>the forces deployed in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>734. </b> The reaction of the media and the Iraqi population to perceived difficulties </p>
<p>encountered within days of the start of an operation, which was planned to last up to </p>
<p>125 days, might have been anticipated if there had been more rigorous examination </p>
<p>of possible scenarios pre-conflict and the media had better understood the original </p>
<p>concept of operations and the nature of the Coalition responses to the situations they </p>
<p>encountered once the campaign began.</p>
<p><b>735. </b> The difficulty and complexity of successfully delivering distinct strategic messages </p>
<p>to each of the audiences a government needs to reach should not be underestimated. </p>
<p>For any future military operations, arrangements tailored to meet the circumstances </p>
<p>of each operation need to be put in place in both London and on the ground before </p>
<p>operations begin. </p>
<p><b>736. </b> When the UK acceded to the US request that it assume leadership of a military </p>
<p>Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompassing four provinces in southern Iraq, it did so </p>
<p>without a robust analysis either of the strategic implications for the UK or of the military’s </p>
<p>capacity to support the UK’s potential obligations in the region. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>8  |  The invasion</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>737. </b> A step of such magnitude should be taken deliberately and having considered the </p>
<p>wider strategic and resource implications and contingent liabilities. </p>
<p><b>738. </b> That requires all government departments whose responsibilities will be engaged </p>
<p>to have been formally involved in providing Ministers with coherent inter-departmental </p>
<p>advice before decisions are taken; the proper function of the Cabinet Committee system. </p>
