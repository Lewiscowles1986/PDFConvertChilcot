<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>402</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the final attempts to secure support for the UK, US and </p>
<p>Spanish draft resolution tabled in the Security Council on 7 March 2003 and, when that </p>
<p>failed, the UK Government’s decision to take military action without the support of the </p>
<p>majority of the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> Other key developments during that time are addressed elsewhere in the </p>
<p>Report, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provision of advice by Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, on the legal basis </p>
<p>for military action to secure Iraq’s compliance with its disarmament obligations, </p>
<p>which is addressed in Section 5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning for military operations in southern Iraq, which is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 6.2;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK planning and preparations for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, which are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 6.5; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assessments and advice on Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic </p>
<p>missile capabilities, its intention to conceal them from inspections and its </p>
<p>intentions for their use in response to a military attack, which are addressed </p>
<p>in Section 4.3. That Section also addresses the withdrawal after the conflict of </p>
<p>three streams of intelligence reporting which had influenced judgements about </p>
<p>Iraq’s capabilities and intentions.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the development of the UK Government’s </p>
<p>strategy and options on Iraq before the invasion began, including the way in which the </p>
<p>policy was developed and decisions were taken, are contained in Section 7.</p>
<p><b>The end of the UN route</b></p>
<p><b>4.  In an attempt to secure support in the Security Council for the second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution, Mr Blair decided on 8 March to propose delaying a decision and </b></p>
<p><b>identifying specific tests as the basis to determine whether Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>intended to co-operate.</b></p>
<p><b>5.  Mr Blair began by consulting Mr Ricardo Lagos, the Chilean President, who </b></p>
<p><b>agreed the proposal was worth exploring, although he thought more time would </b></p>
<p><b>be needed.</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> The UK’s attempts, during February and early March 2003, to reach agreement </p>
<p>with the US on the text of a draft resolution stating that Iraq had failed to take the final </p>
<p>opportunity to comply with its obligations and to secure international support for that </p>
<p>position, and the opposition of France, Russia and others, are set out in Section 3.7.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>403</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The text of the UK, US and Spanish draft resolution tabled in the Security Council on </p>
<p>7 March called on Iraq “to take the decisions necessary in the interests of its people and </p>
<p>the region”, which was characterised as a strategic decision by Iraq to disarm.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The draft resolution also set a deadline of 17 March for Iraq to demonstrate its “full, </p>
<p>unconditional, immediate and active co-operation” in accordance with its obligations </p>
<p>and to yield possession of all prohibited items to the UN Monitoring, Verification and </p>
<p>Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) or the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p><b>9. </b> In the discussions in New York on 7 March, questions were raised about how </p>
<p>the judgement would be made that Iraq had taken a strategic decision to disarm.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, also </p>
<p>advised that benchmarks for Iraqi compliance would need to be agreed to secure the </p>
<p>support of Chile and Mexico for the UK’s proposals.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> In his conversation with President Bush on 7 March, Mr Blair emphasised the </p>
<p>importance of securing nine positive votes in the Security Council for Parliamentary </p>
<p>approval for UK military action.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> While the 17 March deadline in the draft resolution was </p>
<p>not sufficient for Iraq to disarm fully, it was sufficient to make a judgement on whether </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had had a change of heart. Mr Blair argued that if Iraq started to  </p>
<p>co-operate, the inspectors could have as much time as they liked.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Following up their conversations in the previous week, Mr Blair spoke to President </p>
<p>Lagos on 8 March.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The draft speaking note produced by Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary for Foreign Affairs, suggested that Mr Blair could tell President Lagos that, </p>
<p>after the report to the Security Council on 7 March by Dr Hans Blix, the Executive </p>
<p>Chairman of UNMOVIC:</p>
<p>“… no one believes that Saddam has given immediate, unconditional or full  </p>
<p>co-operation and intelligence shows that he has no intention of doing so, but that </p>
<p>he will continue to dribble out concessions under pressure from our military  </p>
<p>build-up in order to fool some people and divide international opinion.</p>
<p>“We must not allow ourselves to be fooled. Equally we need to be fair, so that </p>
<p>Saddam genuinely does have a chance for a change of heart to avert military action. </p>
<p>So I have taken on board your point that you need some concrete tests to judge </p>
<p>Saddam by.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>404</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The points in the speaking note also included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A description of “five key areas and one key test in each area, for Saddam </p>
<p>to meet by 17 March”, which had been “picked out” from the draft “clusters” </p>
<p>document produced by UNMOVIC.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein “had any intention of complying, he would be able to do </p>
<p>these. If he were to do all of them, it would show that he has had a change of </p>
<p>heart, though even then it would not add up to full disarmament.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The tests were designed to be “as straightforward and concrete as possible”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “onus” was “on Saddam to prove his innocence, not on us to prove </p>
<p>his guilt”.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> It was clear in Mr Blair’s discussion with President Lagos on 8 March that Chile did </p>
<p>not support the approach in the draft resolution.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Blair stated that he had worked out five specific tests. He would send them </p>
<p>to President Lagos, who agreed to discuss the proposals with Mr Vicente Fox, the </p>
<p>Mexican President.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Blair told President Lagos that China would not veto the resolution but France </p>
<p>would; and that he had not given up on persuading Russia to abstain. A “further reason </p>
<p>to want a second resolution, with a gap before the start of military action, was to give the </p>
<p>Arabs a chance to press Saddam to go into exile”.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), subsequently wrote to President Lagos </p>
<p>setting out five tests.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>18. </b> The first test would be to insist on interviews outside Iraq as specified in resolution </p>
<p>1441. The remaining four tests were “based on” the UNMOVIC “clusters” document and </p>
<p>would require Saddam Hussein “to provide either the material that is unaccounted for, </p>
<p>or to produce full documentation proving its destruction” in respect of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>chemical weapons – “specifically VX”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>biological weapons – “specifically anthrax”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>missiles – “specifically SCUDS”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) – “specifically their possible adaptation to </p>
<p>deliver CW [chemical weapons]”.</p>

<p>405</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Sir David stated that Mr Blair believed:</p>
<p>“… that if Saddam Hussein intends to disarm voluntarily, and comply with successive </p>
<p>UN resolutions, he should be ready to co-operate fully in each of these categories. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister also believes that public opinion would see these five demands </p>
<p>as clear and fair tests of Saddam Hussein’s intentions, and ones that can quickly </p>
<p>be met.”</p>
<p><b>20. </b> In a further conversation late on 9 March, President Lagos and Mr Blair discussed </p>
<p>the proposed tests.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Mr Blair agreed that they should check that Dr Blix “did not think the tests were </p>
<p>unreasonable”. If the tests showed that Saddam Hussein was serious about  </p>
<p>co-operation, the tests could be followed by a timetable leading to disarmament. The </p>
<p>proposal was “halfway between setting out a detailed time schedule now, which the US </p>
<p>would not agree, and the current situation with its lack of definition of full co-operation”.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> Mr Blair also raised the possibility of pushing back the deadline to 24 March, “though </p>
<p>he had not raised this with the US”.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Blair told President Lagos that:</p>
<p>“… he thought we had eight votes. If Mexico and Chile could support the resolution </p>
<p>on the basis of these proposals there would be enormous pressure on Saddam, and </p>
<p>it would be possible that France/Russia would not veto.”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> President Lagos agreed the approach was worth exploring, but he would want to </p>
<p>see changes to the wording of the draft ultimatum and an additional week.</p>
<p><b>25.  On 9 March, Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, </b></p>
<p><b>declared she would resign if the UK took military action against Iraq without </b></p>
<p><b>UN authority.</b></p>
<p><b>26. </b> In an interview for <i>BBC Radio 4’</i>s <i>Westminster Hour</i> broadcast on 9 March, </p>
<p>Ms Clare Short said she would resign from the Government if the UK took military action </p>
<p>against Iraq without UN authority.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Asked whether she thought Mr Blair had acted “recklessly”, Ms Short described the </p>
<p>situation as “extraordinarily reckless”.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> In response to further questions Ms Short said:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… what worries me is that we’ve got the old spin back and we have detailed </p>
<p>discussions either personally or in the Cabinet and then the spin the next day is: </p>
<p>‘we’re ready for war’.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>406</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If it takes another month or so, that is fine …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… I think you could get a world where we see the UN in authority … proper care </p>
<p>for the people of Iraq, because at the moment the preparations to care for the </p>
<p>humanitarian aftermath of any military conflict are not properly in place.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“And there’s another major legal point – if there isn’t a UN mandate for the </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq … It will in international law be an occupying army and </p>
<p>won’t have the authority to make changes in the administrative arrangements </p>
<p>in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Ms Short informed Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications </p>
<p>and Strategy, and Mr Suma Chakrabarti, the Department for International Development </p>
<p>(DFID) Permanent Secretary, of her action as soon as the interview had been recorded.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Ms Short wrote in her memoir that she:</p>
<p>“… had decided war was unstoppable. I had experienced enough wars to know that </p>
<p>it was too late to criticise when our troops were on the ground …”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Ms Short also wrote that her diary entry for 9 March read:</p>
<p>“TB [Mr Blair] rang, furious. Said I am undermining his delicate negotiations …</p>
<p>“… I said sorry to upset but doing what I think right, no good resigning after war </p>
<p>started. He said 7 days yet, can’t leave that man there.”</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Robin Cook, who in March 2003 was Leader of the House of Commons, wrote </p>
<p>that on 10 March he had agreed with Ms Hilary Armstrong, the Chief Whip, that, on </p>
<p>13 March, he would announce a debate on Iraq for the following week.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>33.  No.10 officials emphasised to their counterparts in the White House the </b></p>
<p><b>crucial importance of securing nine votes in support of a resolution in the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>34.  The UK thought that more time, possibly until the end of March, could be </b></p>
<p><b>needed to build support.</b></p>
<p><b>35. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Condoleezza Rice, the US National Security Advisor, that </p>
<p>he thought they were “still short of nine votes” for the draft resolution.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Chile and Mexico </p>
<p>“would probably abstain” and China “might veto in French and Russian company”. There </p>
<p>was “an increasingly difficult domestic political background”, which “re-emphasised how </p>
<p>crucial it was to secure nine votes”. Time would be a factor in that.</p>

<p>407</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Sir David argued that the US and UK “should be ready to oblige if what they wanted </p>
<p>was another ten days, or the end of the month”. That would be:</p>
<p>“… a small price to pay for securing the nine votes that were needed if UK forces </p>
<p>were to participate in military action, and if we were to be sure that the Prime </p>
<p>Minister could survive a vote in the House of Commons. Obviously these were </p>
<p>our priorities … It did not make sense to give the military timetable precedence </p>
<p>over the political realities … I could not believe that the military planning could </p>
<p>not be massaged to allow more time if there was a chance that this would make </p>
<p>the difference.”</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Sir David commented that he had:</p>
<p>“… laid it on the line this evening. I left Condi [Dr Rice] in no doubt about our political </p>
<p>difficulties; and … that the Administration should be ready to make concessions on </p>
<p>test/benchmarks and on timing if that was what it took to get nine votes …”</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The timing of the vote on a second a resolution and for a Parliamentary debate </p>
<p>in the UK, and the potential difficulties of securing nine votes in the Security Council </p>
<p>and a majority in Parliament, were discussed in a subsequent conference call between </p>
<p>Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, Mr Campbell and Sir David Manning and </p>
<p>the White House.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>39. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that the White House had said that:</p>
<p>“… if we got a majority with vetoes, Bush wanted to go straight in, within days, even </p>
<p>short of the March 17 deadline, would say the UN had failed to act, and get going, </p>
<p>on the basis of 1441. We made the point that we needed a second resolution. </p>
<p>Without it we had real problems in Parliament. They said continually that they </p>
<p>wanted to help us but of course what they really wanted was the use of our forces.</p>
<p>“Jonathan and I continually emphasised we needed the second resolution. We </p>
<p>had seven definite votes still, but Condi was less confident re Chile and Mexico … </p>
<p>They [the US] basically wanted by Tuesday/Wednesday to say we had exhausted </p>
<p>every effort and now the diplomatic window had closed. We said that if we got the </p>
<p>majority for a second resolution, even with vetoes we would have to go through </p>

<p>408</p>
<p><b>40.  Mr Blair left President Bush in no doubt that he needed a second resolution </b></p>
<p><b>to secure Parliamentary support for UK involvement in military action and sought </b></p>
<p><b>support for his initiative of setting out tests in a side statement, including that the </b></p>
<p><b>vote in the Security Council might have to be delayed “by a couple of days”.</b></p>
<p><b>41.  Offered the opportunity not to take military action, Mr Blair assured President </b></p>
<p><b>Bush the UK would be with the US “if he possibly could be”.</b></p>
<p><b>42.  President Bush was evidently unwilling to countenance delay and was </b></p>
<p><b>reported to have told Mr Blair that, if the second resolution failed, he would find </b></p>
<p><b>another way to involve the UK.</b></p>
<p><b>43. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the position late on 9 March, including the </p>
<p>positions of Mexico and Chile.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that he was working with President Lagos on identifying </p>
<p>tests for compliance in five specific areas and suggested that they (the US and the UK) </p>
<p>should consider delaying the vote by a couple of days.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that “he [Mr Blair] would be with the US if he possibly </p>
<p>could be”.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that President Bush responded that if the second resolution </p>
<p>failed, he would find another way to involve the UK. He would “rather go alone militarily </p>
<p>than have the British Government fall”.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> President Bush wrote in his memoir that he told Mr Blair he would “rather have </p>
<p>him drop out of the Coalition and keep his government than try to stay in and lose it”; </p>
<p>and that Mr Blair said, “I’m with you … I absolutely believe in this. I will take it up to the </p>
<p>very last”.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“TB started by saying he was ‘fighting on all fronts’. ‘Attaboy’ came the reply, a bit </p>
<p>too patronisingly for my tastes. TB said one of his Ministers was threatening to </p>
<p>resign, also that Chirac [Mr Jacques Chirac, the French President] told Lagos that </p>
<p>the Africans were ‘in the bag’ … TB had spoken to four of the leaders who made </p>
<p>up the 8 plus 1. Musharraf [Mr Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani President] was </p>
<p>with us but it was difficult for him. Cameroon said absolutely. Guinea’s Foreign </p>
<p>Minister coming tomorrow. Dos Santos [Mr José Eduardo Dos Santos, the Angolan </p>
<p>President] solid.</p>
<p>“TB was doing most of the talking … He felt Bush needed to work some more on </p>
<p>Fox. He felt if we could get them to accept the idea of the tests, other countries </p>

<p>would also come with us. But Bush said he was already putting enormous pressure </p>
<p>on Mexico. He said he had also been twisting Lagos’ arm …</p>
<p>“Bush not happy. Bush said Saddam was very adept at exploiting weakness and Blix </p>
<p>was weak. These countries need to see that we want to do this peacefully. He wants </p>
<p>the vote to go through but not on an unreasonable basis.</p>
<p>“TB said the public opinion problem stemmed from people feeling the US wanted </p>
<p>a war. We have to put up the genuine tests of disarmament, show the determination </p>
<p>to try to do this peacefully.</p>
<p>“Bush said he had never come across a situation where the dividing line between </p>
<p>success and failure was so narrow. He said he wanted it done peacefully, or any </p>
<p>other way. His tone was very different to TB’s. Bush was talking the diplomatic talk </p>
<p>while clearly very irritated by the whole thing. His worry was that we were negotiating </p>
<p>with ourselves, that we got a resolution with a timeframe, everything we want, and </p>
<p>we get nothing for it. He said he couldn’t believe Chirac said he had the Africans in </p>
<p>the bag. ‘I can’, said TB. ‘I have a lot of experience of them.’</p>
<p>“He [Bush] was clearly aware of how tough things were getting for TB. He said if </p>
<p>the swing countries didn’t vote with us ‘my last choice is for your Government to </p>
<p>go down. That is the absolute last thing I want to have happen. I would rather go it </p>
<p>alone than have your Government fall.’ ‘I appreciate that’, said TB. ‘I really mean </p>
<p>that’ said Bush. TB said it was also important that he understood that he really </p>
<p>believed in what they were trying to do. Bush – ‘I know that but I am not going to </p>
<p>see your Government fall on this.’</p>
<p>“TB said ‘I’ve got our troops there too. If I can’t get this through Parliament, we fall, </p>
<p>and that’s not exactly the regime change I want. We have to work out what Chile and </p>
<p>Mexico need.’</p>
<p>“They agreed to speak again to Lagos and to Fox. TB said we were in high-risk, </p>
<p>high-reward territory. Bush said he was being eroded domestically by inactivity. </p>
<p>He also said he felt the hardest part would be after Saddam. Then Bush did a </p>
<p>number on the changes in the Arab world that could follow.</p>
<p>“TB said the biggest concern in not going with the UN was the lack of support </p>
<p>if things went wrong. Tommy Franks [General Franks, Commander in Chief US </p>
<p>Central Command (CENTCOM)] had said ninety per cent of precision bombs are </p>
<p>precise. That leaves ten per cent.</p>
<p>“But Bush was left in no doubt TB would be with him when the time came.</p>
<p>“Bush said ‘I’m not going to let you down. Hang on in there buddy. You are </p>
<p>doing great.’</p>

<p>not make too much of his own problems, and was stressing he thought we were </p>

<p><b>49.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix was prepared to work with the UK </b></p>
<p><b>on identifying tests “as long as the bar was not out of reach of a complying Iraq”.</b></p>
<p><b>50.  Dr Blix had reminded Sir Jeremy that UNMOVIC still lacked clear evidence that </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq possessed any weapons of mass destruction (WMD).</b></p>
<p><b>51. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock met Dr Blix late on 9 March to explore whether the various </p>
<p>ideas for an ultimatum combined with specific tests for Iraq could be made part of a new </p>
<p>UN resolution.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Sir Jeremy told Dr Blix that the “risk of failure on our current draft was high enough </p>
<p>for another way forward to be contemplated”. The UK might now be prepared “to set </p>
<p>Saddam a series of tests, with dates set for him to meet specific requirements. If he </p>
<p>failed at any stage, the final opportunity would be lost”. It would be important to devise </p>
<p>tests that set the bar high, and not to lower them “in the face of Iraqi bluster”. The UK </p>
<p>needed a professional judgement from Dr Blix on which areas should be set as tests.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix was prepared to work with the UK on a series of </p>
<p>tests over timed periods “as long as the bar was not out of reach of a complying Iraq”; </p>
<p>and that he had assured Dr Blix that that was not the UK’s objective. The US still had </p>
<p>to be persuaded, “but that was our job”.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Dr Blix had also reminded Sir Jeremy “that UNMOVIC still lacked clear evidence </p>
<p>that Iraq possessed any WMD at all”.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Following discussion of the details, Sir Jeremy commented that:</p>
<p>“… subject to further thoughts from UNMOVIC … a convincing test by, say 21 March </p>
<p>would comprise:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Interviews [outside Iraq], accepting UNMOVIC’s lower number, with a venue of </p>
<p>either Larnaca or Bahrain, and adding a warning about intimidation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RPVs and spray tanks [for possible delivery of chemical or biological agent]: </p>
<p>full documentation and explanations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Completion of the Al Samoud destruction (since they are obviously keeping </p>
<p>some for a conflict).</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>57. </b> Mr Tim Dowse, Head of the FCO Non-Proliferation Department, wrote to Mr Peter </p>
<p>Ricketts, FCO Political Director, on 10 March, commenting that the No.10 benchmarks </p>
<p>“more or less” overlapped with a version he had produced, but cautioning against setting </p>
<p>a figure on the number of scientists to be interviewed outside Iraq.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> In Mr Dowse’s view </p>
<p>there was “no magic in 150”; UNMOVIC could not handle that number.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr Dowse also commented that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The tests on biological programmes might include growth media as well as </p>
<p>anthrax. Iraq had admitted possessing material “as recently as 1999” and it was </p>
<p>“simply not credible that all documentation has disappeared in such a short </p>
<p>space of time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had “included the mobile bio-labs mainly because they’ve had so much </p>
<p>publicity”, and there was “fairly firm intelligence about them”; but if Iraq refused </p>
<p>to admit their existence, the UK was “in a bind, because we are unlikely to be </p>
<p>able to prove they do exist. So perhaps we should drop them.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had included bombs and shells because they were “concrete things, more </p>
<p>easily visualised than VX”, and there was “less room for argument over whether </p>
<p>they have been destroyed or not” in the light of the “scope for Iraqi obfuscation </p>
<p>over destruction of VX”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The problem with “almost any benchmark relating to SCUD-type missiles” was </p>
<p>that Iraq had claimed they were destroyed and “we can’t prove the contrary”. </p>
<p>Demands for the 50 SCUD warheads which were “unaccounted-for” faced the </p>
<p>same problem.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He thought accelerated destruction of the Al Samoud 2 missiles and the </p>
<p>associated production equipment, including “the test stand [at al-Rafah] if Blix </p>
<p>agrees”, would be a better test.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The No.10 benchmark on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) was “a poor one” </p>
<p>referring to a programme in the 1990s. It would be better “to use the ‘drone with </p>
<p>a wingspan of 7.45 metres’ which UNMOVIC have just discovered” which had </p>
<p>not been declared by Iraq and which the US was “pretty confident” was an illegal </p>
<p>system which they thought they had tracked “flying over 500km”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>His preference was to pitch the test more widely for the destruction of “all UAVs </p>
<p>with CBW applications”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>61. </b> In preparation for a telephone call to Dr Blix on 10 March, Mr Rycroft advised </p>
<p>Mr Blair that he could not allow the proposals for tests to be watered down and that </p>
<p>initial tests would show whether there was a change of heart to allow full co-operation.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair might need to remind Dr Blix that his 7 March report had noted that Iraq should </p>
<p>be able to provide more documentary evidence; and that where documents were not </p>
<p>available, interviews could be another way to obtain evidence.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Mr Blair told Dr Blix that “the only way to avoid immediate conflict and allow more </p>
<p>time for inspections was to lay down a set of tests … If these were met, we could </p>
<p>establish a future work programme.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> He did not know if the US would agree the </p>
<p>approach and could try to “extend the 17 March deadline a bit”.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> In the discussion of the possible tests, Dr Blix noted that it would not be possible </p>
<p>for Iraq to “yield up” all its WMD by 17 March, as proposed in the draft resolution. </p>
<p>The proposed test on anthrax would also be difficult. He suggested the addition of the </p>
<p>complete destruction of Al Samoud missiles.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Dr Blix wrote that he had been invited to the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in </p>
<p>New York to take a call from Mr Blair at 1.30pm London time.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> Mr Blair had said “they </p>
<p>needed five or six items on which the Iraqis would demonstrate their compliance with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s work programme”. The items the UK had been considering “included </p>
<p>accounting for anthrax, the chemical agents VX and mustard, SCUD missiles and </p>
<p>remotely piloted vehicles: and promising genuine co-operation with UNMOVIC’s plans </p>
<p>to take scientists (along with their families) for interviews outside Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Dr Blix wrote that: “The process could not go on until April/May but perhaps it could </p>
<p>extend a few days beyond March 17.”</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Dr Blix added that he had told Mr Blair that all the “items” he had mentioned would </p>
<p>fall within the list of unresolved disarmament issues, but: “Whether they would all be </p>
<p>among the key issues we would select, I could not yet say with certainty.”</p>
<p><b>67. </b> Dr Blix commented that he had “sensed” that Mr Blair had “found it hard to </p>
<p>persuade the US to go along”.</p>

<p>Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director General of the IAEA, and the provisions of the </p>
<p>revised draft resolution, tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March, giving the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime a deadline by which it was required to demonstrate that it was prepared to </p>
<p>disarm peacefully.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>70. </b> Mr Straw emphasised that resolution 1441, giving “Iraq a ‘final opportunity’ to </p>
<p>comply with a series of disarmament obligations” had been adopted four months </p>
<p>previously; and that, during the debate in the Security Council:</p>
<p>“… not a single speaker claimed that Iraq was in compliance with those obligations; </p>
<p>neither did a single speaker deny that Iraq has been in flagrant breach of </p>
<p>international law for the past 12 years.”</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Mr Straw welcomed Dr ElBaradei’s report that “the IAEA had found no evidence </p>
<p>or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons programme in Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Dr Blix, “on the other hand”, had “reported movement in some limited areas: for </p>
<p>example the partial destruction of prohibited Al Samoud missiles”. But that was “only </p>
<p>the tip of the iceberg of Iraq’s illegal weapons programme”, and the “full extent of the </p>
<p>iceberg was revealed” in an UNMOVIC document, <i>Unresolved Disarmament Issues: </i></p>
<p><i>Iraq’s Proscribed weapons Programmes</i>, which had now been made public.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Mr Straw </p>
<p>described the document as setting out, in “173 pages of painstaking detail, the terrible </p>
<p>nature of the weapons Saddam has sought with such determination to develop”. </p>
<p>It was “a catalogue of evasion, deceit and feigning co-operation while in reality pursuing </p>
<p>concealment”. The “sheer scale of Iraq’s efforts to develop and hide” its weapons could </p>
<p>“be grasped only by reading the whole document”.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Citing the potential impact of “tiny amounts” of anthrax, Mr Straw stated that: </p>
<p>“Contrary to Iraqi assertions”, the inspectors found evidence of anthrax where Iraq </p>
<p>had declared there was none. There was “a strong presumption that some 10,000 </p>
<p>litres of anthrax” had not been destroyed and “may still exist”, and Iraq possessed “the </p>
<p>technology and materials to allow it to return swiftly to the pre-1991 production levels”.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Addressing the suggestions that inspections should be given more time, and </p>
<p>specifically the memorandum produced by France, Germany and Russia on 5 March, </p>
<p>Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein was “a master at playing for time” and that </p>
<p>continuing inspections “with no firm end date” would “not achieve the disarmament </p>
<p>required by the Security Council”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Challenging Iraq’s claim that it had no weapons of mass destruction, Mr Straw </p>
<p>said it was:</p>
<p>“… the same old refrain that we have heard … for the past 12 years. Yet whenever </p>
<p>the inspectors have caught the regime out, it has first protested, then conceded that </p>
<p>narrow point, but then mendaciously claimed that there are no more.”</p>
<p><b>76. </b> Characterising the choice to be made as whether to “stand firm” in pursuing </p>
<p>the objective of disarmament or settling for a policy which would “in truth” allow </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to:</p>
<p>“… rebuild his arsenal under cover of just enough co-operation to keep the </p>
<p>inspectors tied down for years to come. We should not deceive ourselves. </p>
<p>The alternative proposals before the Security Council amount to a return to the </p>
<p>failed policy of so-called containment. But the truth is that containment can never </p>
<p>bring disarmament, nor is it the policy of the United Nations as expressed in </p>
<p>resolution 1441 and in all the preceding resolutions going back to 1991.”</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Stating that the reality was that Saddam Hussein only responded to pressure, and </p>
<p>therefore that that pressure should be increased, Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had to be put to the test. The initiative to produce the revised resolution tabled in </p>
<p>the Security Council on 7 March stemmed from the Government’s “desire to secure </p>
<p>a peaceful outcome”. Negotiations on the detail were continuing and the UK was </p>
<p>“examining whether a list of defined tests for Iraqi compliance would be useful in helping </p>
<p>the Security Council to come to a judgement”.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Straw said that he profoundly hoped that the Iraqi regime would “even at this </p>
<p>late stage, seize the chance to disarm peacefully”. He added: “The only other peaceful </p>
<p>alternative would be for Saddam Hussein to heed the calls of a number of other Arab </p>
<p>leaders for him to go into exile and to hand over to a new leadership prepared to </p>
<p>conform with the Council’s demands.” If Saddam Hussein refused to co-operate, the </p>
<p>Security Council “had to face up to its clear responsibilities” under the UN Charter.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Addressing the potential consequences of military action, Mr Straw stated that the </p>
<p>international community would have “a duty to build a secure, prosperous future for the </p>
<p>Iraqi people”. In his meeting with Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, on 6 March, </p>
<p>he had proposed “that the UN should take the lead role in co-ordinating international </p>
<p>efforts to rebuild Iraq, and that they should be underpinned by a clear UN mandate”.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Mr Straw acknowledged the fear that action on Iraq might “exacerbate tensions </p>
<p>elsewhere in the region”, and emphasised the need for progress in restoring a </p>
<p>meaningful peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. He concluded:</p>
<p>“A lasting settlement in the Middle East will remove one great threat to security … </p>
<p>In confronting the danger from Iraq’s weapons, the UN can remove another great </p>
<p>threat. We must not let Saddam turn his ‘final opportunity’ to disarm … into endless </p>

<p>415</p>
<p>opportunities to delay. The future not only of the region but of UN authority is </p>
<p>at stake.”</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Mr Michael Ancram (Conservative), described the Iraq situation as outlined by </p>
<p>Mr Straw as “grim” and encouraged the Government, in response to the serious </p>
<p>questions and doubts about whether the case for action had been made, to “ensure </p>
<p>that the case for action continues to be made and strongly”, and to produce more of </p>
<p>the information it had for the British people to absorb.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> Asked by Mr Ancram what the Government’s position would be in the event </p>
<p>that three Permanent Members of the Security Council vetoed a second resolution, </p>
<p>Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“We have made it clear throughout that we want a second resolution for political </p>
<p>reasons, because a consensus is required, if we can achieve it, for any military </p>
<p>action. On the legal basis for that, it should be pointed out that resolution 1441 does </p>
<p>not require a second resolution …”</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Michael Moore (Liberal Democrat) asked Mr Straw to accept that there were </p>
<p>“still diplomatic and political options open to the international community and that the </p>
<p>military agenda must not dictate the calendar for inspections”; and if he believed that </p>
<p>“war should be the last resort”. Threatening to ignore the United Nations undermined </p>
<p>the principles of international law.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Straw responded that war was and “should always be a last resort”. The UK </p>
<p>was not ignoring the UN. Mr Blair had “moved heaven and earth to ensure that the </p>
<p>whole issue of Iraq” was “dealt with through the United Nations”.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Asked by Mr Simon Thomas (Plaid Cymru) to remind the House “exactly … which </p>
<p>part of resolution 1441 authorises war”, Mr Straw said:</p>
<p>“I am delighted to do so. We start with paragraph 1, which says that the Security </p>
<p>Council ‘Decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations </p>
<p>under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 … in particular through Iraq’s </p>

<p>INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS IN NEW YORK</p>
<p><b>86. </b> Reporting informal consultations in New York on 10 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>said that he had drawn the attention of the Security Council to Mr Straw’s statement and </p>
<p>the reference to work on a list of defined tests.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> That had “caused a fair bit of interest”.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that, in response to questions, the points made by </p>
<p>Dr Blix included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>40 interviews had been requested and 15 had been conducted “to </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s modalities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The RPV UNMOVIC had discovered was important and should have been </p>
<p>declared. UNMOVIC was examining whether it was proscribed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>52 Al Samoud 2 missiles had been destroyed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was difficult for him to assess the regional threat posed by WMD. There were </p>
<p>no confirmed cases of its existence and UNMOVIC had never maintained Iraq </p>
<p>had them. But the clusters document recorded Iraqi deceit; repeated Full, Final </p>
<p>and Complete Disclosures (FFCDs); hide and seek and cheating in the past. </p>
<p>There were a lot of accounting problems.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC was not expressing any low regard for intelligence agencies but no </p>
<p>WMD had been found as a result of tips on location. Part of the reason might be </p>
<p>that intelligence was gathered at levels which did not deal with actual storage.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Experience showed that it was possible that Iraq could have mobile </p>
<p>biological facilities.</p>

<p><b>91. </b> In the second conversation, Mr Blair reported progress on the three areas President </p>

<p>should not push the matter to a vote if we were going to be vetoed”; but that had not yet </p>
<p>been agreed by Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, they discussed the “seven solid votes” </p>

<p>Mr Blair outlined the tests and his efforts to secure support from Chile and Mexico. </p>
<p>They would not support a Spanish proposal simply to affirm resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> In his account of the conversation, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had done most </p>

<p> President Bush thought that there were “seven votes solid ‘locked up’, </p>

<p>so worried about losing”. Mr Campbell added that he “could sense in his voice and the </p>

<p>Mexico could be shifted, that would “change the weather”. If France and Russia then </p>
<p>vetoed the resolution but the “numbers were right on the UN”, Mr Blair thought that </p>
<p>he would “have a fighting chance of getting it through the Commons”. Subsequently, </p>
<p>Mr Blair had suggested that a change in Chile and Mexico’s position might be used </p>
<p>to influence Mr Vladimir Putin, the Russian President.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> President Bush was “worried about rolling in more time” but Mr Blair had “held his </p>
<p>ground”, arguing that Chile and Mexico would “need to be able to point to something that </p>
<p>they won last minute that explains why they finally supported us”. President Bush “said </p>
<p>‘Let me be frank. The second resolution is for the benefit of Great Britain. We would </p>
<p>want it so we can go ahead together.’” President Bush’s position was that the US and </p>
<p>the UK “must not retreat from 1441 and we cannot keep giving them more time”; it was </p>
<p>“time to do this” and there should be “no more deals”.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair concluded the conversation by saying “he was </p>

<p>on 7 March), which “might read”:</p>
<p>“decides that Iraq will have failed to take the final opportunity unless by X date it </p>

<p><b>108. </b> The decision on Iraq’s co-operation would be taken on the basis of Iraq’s response </p>

<p><b>109. </b> Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that President Bush and his military were concerned </p>
<p>about delay:</p>
<p>“It [the proposal for tests/more time] was indeed a hard sell to George. His system </p>
<p>was completely against it. His military were, not unreasonably, fearing that delay </p>
<p>gave the enemy time – and time could mean a tougher struggle and more lives lost. </p>
<p>This was also troubling my military. We had all sorts of contingency plans in place </p>
<p>for what Saddam might do. He might set the oilfields on fire, release chemical, or </p>
<p>worse, biological material, or attack Israel. His past record gave us no confidence in </p>
<p>his trustworthiness or his humanity. There was both UK and US intelligence warning </p>
<p>us of the risk.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless I thought it was worth a try …</p>
<p>“I set out my case for delay in a Note to George. We then had a call. It was tricky but </p>
<p>I laid it on the line and reluctantly he agreed. We got the document prepared with the </p>
<p>Blix people. It had five crucial tests in it. It would, especially on the interview, have </p>
<p>flushed out the regime thoroughly on what they were hiding and on whether they </p>
<p>had any good faith.</p>
<p>“Chile and Mexico were prepared to go along, but only up to a point. Ricardo made </p>
<p>it clear that if there was heavy opposition from France, it would be tough for them to </p>
<p>participate in what would then be a token vote, incapable of being passed because </p>
<p>of a veto – and what’s more, a veto not by Russia, but by France.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the French position had, if anything, got harder not softer. They </p>
<p>were starting to say they would not support military action in any circumstances, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>420</p>
<p><b>110.  In a press conference on 10 March, Mr Annan reiterated the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council’s determination to disarm Iraq, but said that every avenue for a peaceful </b></p>
<p><b>resolution of the crisis had to be exhausted before force should be used.</b></p>
<p><b>111.  Mr Annan also warned that if the Security Council failed to agree on a </b></p>
<p><b>common position, and action was taken without the authority of the Council, </b></p>
<p><b>the legitimacy and support for any such action would be seriously impaired.</b></p>
<p><b>112. </b> During a press conference in The Hague on 10 March, Mr Annan made a short </p>
<p>statement on the position on Iraq.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Mr Annan warned that the “atmosphere of crisis and great anxiety” was “affecting </p>
<p>the whole world”, and that:</p>
<p>“The question of Iraq’s disarmament has brought the international community to </p>
<p>a dangerous point of division and discord …</p>
<p>“… the threat of weapons of mass destruction. It is an issue of the utmost gravity </p>
<p>– by no means confined to Iraq. The whole international community needs to act </p>
<p>together to curb the proliferation of these terrible weapons, wherever it is happening.</p>
<p>“The determination of the Security Council to disarm Iraq of such weapons is the </p>
<p>most urgent issue – because Iraq has actually used such weapons in the past, and </p>
<p>because it has twice committed aggression against its neighbours … On this critical </p>
<p>question, there are no divisions, no grounds for doubt, dispute or delay.</p>
<p>“… people want to see this crisis resolved peacefully. There is widespread concern </p>
<p>about the long term consequences of war in Iraq for the fight against terrorism; </p>
<p>for the Middle East Peace Process [MEPP]; and for the world’s ability to address </p>
<p>common concerns in the future if deep divisions are sowed today between nations </p>
<p>and between people of different religions.</p>
<p>“Indeed, one must have no illusions about what war means. In certain circumstances </p>
<p>the use of force may be necessary to secure a lasting peace. But the reality is </p>
<p>that it would cause great human suffering, whether it is long or short; that it may </p>
<p>lead to regional instability and economic crises; and it can … lead to unintended </p>
<p>consequences producing new threats and new dangers.</p>
<p>“War must always be a last resort – arrived at only if and when every reasonable </p>
<p>avenue of achieving Iraq’s disarmament by peaceful means has been exhausted. </p>
<p>The United Nations … has a duty to search till the very end for the peaceful </p>
<p>resolution of conflicts.”</p>

<p>421</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Mr Annan added:</p>
<p>“The members of the Security Council now face a great choice. If they fail to agree </p>
<p>on a common position, and action is taken without the authority of the Security </p>
<p>Council, the legitimacy and support for any such action will be seriously impaired. </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, they can … address this threat in a united manner and ensure </p>
<p>compliance with their previous resolutions, then the Security Council’s authority will </p>
<p>be enhanced, and the world will be a safer place.</p>
<p>“… Iraq does not exist in a vacuum. What happens there will have profound </p>
<p>implications … for other issues of great importance … The broader the consensus </p>
<p>on Iraq, the better the chance that we can come together again and deal effectively </p>
<p>with other burning conflicts, starting with the one between Israelis and Palestinians. </p>
<p>Only a just resolution of that conflict can bring peace and stability in the region.</p>
<p>“… the success or failure of the international community in dealing with Iraq will </p>
<p>crucially affect its ability to deal with … conflicts …”</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Mr Annan concluded:</p>
<p>“However this conflict is resolved, the United Nations will remain as important as it </p>
<p>is today.</p>
<p>“We have seen in recent months what an immense significance States and people </p>
<p>around the world attach to the legitimacy provided by the … Security Council, and </p>
<p>the United Nations, as the common framework for securing the peace. As they </p>
<p>approach their grave decision, I must solemnly urge all members of the … Council </p>
<p>to keep this in mind, and to be worthy of the trust in them that the world’s peoples </p>
<p>have shown.”</p>
<p><b>116. </b> Asked whether an attack on Iraq without a second resolution would be a breach of </p>
<p>the UN Charter, Mr Annan responded:</p>
<p>“… the Charter is very clear on circumstances under which force can be used. I think </p>
<p>the discussion … is to ensure that the … Council, which is the master of its own </p>
<p>deliberations, is able to pronounce itself on what happens. If the US and others were </p>
<p>to go outside the Council and take military action it would not be in conformity with </p>
<p>the Charter.”</p>
<p><b>President Chirac’s interview, 10 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>117. </b> Sir John Holmes, the British Ambassador to France, reported on 10 March </p>

<p>422</p>
<p>“impervious” to the UK’s arguments, although that “could still change if it looks as if </p>
<p>we might secure the nine votes and avoid Russian and Chinese vetoes”.</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Sir John reported that France’s strategy remained:</p>
<p>“(a) to persuade us not to go for a vote, (b) if this did not work, to stop us from </p>
<p>securing nine votes, and (c) if there are nine votes, to ensure that they have Russian </p>
<p>and Chinese company in vetoing.”</p>
<p><b>119. </b> France was “on the diplomatic offensive”. Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French </p>
<p>Foreign Minister, was visiting Angola, Cameroon and Guinea and President Chirac was </p>
<p>“canvassing support” for a Security Council meeting at Head of State level for a vote </p>
<p>on Iraq.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Sir John commented:</p>
<p>“Although the French have still so far steered clear of saying in so many words that </p>
<p>they will veto, it is hard to interpret their comments and approach in any other way … </p>
<p>It is getting increasingly difficult for the French to backtrack now, having built up so </p>
<p>many expectations domestically and internationally. Whilst we are both fully engaged </p>
<p>in our respective lobbying campaigns there is little we can say to them likely to have </p>
<p>much impact …</p>
<p>“I doubt that benchmarks and a little more time will do the trick … That said, the </p>
<p>dynamics may yet change this week … In any case, going to a vote without at least </p>
<p>some Prime Ministerial contact with Chirac would … be odd. If it looks as though we </p>
<p>have the nine votes and might persuade Russia and China not to vote, a serious </p>
<p>phone call would be well worth a try – if only to ease the way for co-operation in </p>
<p>the aftermath.”</p>
<p><b>121.  In a television interview on the evening of 10 March, President Chirac made </b></p>
<p><b>clear that France did not consider that the UN inspections had reached a “dead </b></p>
<p><b>end” and warned of the adverse consequences of unilateral US military action.</b></p>
<p><b>122.  Addressing the “most probable” scenario that evening, President Chirac </b></p>
<p><b>said that the revised resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March would </b></p>
<p><b>not secure the support of nine members of the Council. If, however, there was </b></p>
<p><b>a majority, France would “vote no”.</b></p>
<p><b>123.  Asked about his position, President Chirac replied that “regardless of the </b></p>
<p><b>circumstances”, France would vote “no” because “this evening” there were no </b></p>
<p><b>grounds for waging war to disarm Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>124.  President Chirac also stated that if the inspectors reported that they were not </b></p>
<p><b>in a position to guarantee Iraq’s disarmament, war would become inevitable.</b></p>
<p><b>125. </b> In a television interview on the evening of 10 March, President Chirac argued </p>
<p>that a country with Iraq’s past and political structure was always dangerous, but it </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>423</p>
<p>was “genuinely dangerous only if it has the capabilities to commit aggression, if it </p>
<p>has the capabilities to attack”.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> The “problem was to make sure it no longer had </p>
<p>those capabilities or … that those capabilities could be controlled and destroyed”. </p>
<p>The inspections regime between 1991 and 1998 had destroyed more weapons than the </p>
<p>Gulf Conflict in 1991, and “resulted in the complete, almost complete eradication in all </p>
<p>likelihood … of Iraq’s nuclear programmes”. Iraq’s (Al Samoud 2) missiles with a longer </p>
<p>than permitted range were “being destroyed”.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> President Chirac acknowledged that there were “probably other weapons” but </p>
<p>Dr Blix had told the Security Council that if Iraq stepped up co-operation, which was </p>
<p>“never sufficient but which has improved”, weapons of mass destruction could be </p>
<p>eliminated. It was for the inspectors to advise whether they could complete their task. </p>
<p>If they reported that they were not in a position to guarantee Iraq’s disarmament, it </p>
<p>would be:</p>
<p>“… for the Security Council alone to decide the right thing to do. But in that case … </p>
<p>regrettably, the war would become inevitable. It isn’t today.”</p>
<p><b>127. </b> President Chirac stated that other regimes, such as North Korea, had nuclear </p>
<p>weapons which were “not hypothetical”, but definitely existed.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> President Chirac stated that the international community had unanimously chosen </p>
<p>the path of disarming Iraq; it had not decided the objective was to change the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime; and that:</p>
<p>“Today nothing tells us that this path is a dead end and, consequently, it must be </p>
<p>pursued since war is always a final resort, always an acknowledgement of failure, </p>
<p>always the worse solution … And we don’t consider we are at that point. That is </p>
<p>why we are refusing to embark on a path automatically leading to war so long as </p>
<p>the inspectors haven’t told us: ‘we can’t do any more’ … they are telling us the </p>
<p>opposite.”</p>
<p><b>129. </b> President Chirac argued that the “new resolution setting an ultimatum” represented </p>
<p>a move from a course of action involving the pursuit of inspections in order to </p>
<p>disarm Iraq to “a different one consisting of saying: ‘in so many days, we go to war’”. </p>
<p>France would not accept “that solution”.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> In response to a series of questions, President Chirac stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“So the first scenario which is today, this evening, the most probable, is that this </p>
<p>resolution won’t get a majority of nine members …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There will be nations who will vote ‘no’, including France … But … there won’t </p>
<p>be a majority. So there won’t be a veto problem.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“… the second scenario … the views of a number of people change … there </p>
<p>may indeed be a majority … in favour of the new resolution … If that happens, </p>
<p>France will vote ‘no’ … when one of the five Permanent Members … votes ‘no’, </p>
<p>and even if there is a majority in favour … the resolution isn’t adopted. That’s </p>
<p>what’s called exercising a veto.”</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Asked: “And, this evening, this is your position in principle?”, President Chirac </p>
<p>responded:</p>
<p>“My position is that, regardless of the circumstances, France will vote ‘no’ because </p>
<p>she considers this evening that there are no grounds for waging war in order to </p>
<p>achieve the goal we have set ourselves, ie to disarm Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>132. </b> Asked whether France would use its veto regardless of the position of China and </p>
<p>Russia, President Chirac replied that if there was a resolution authorising war, they </p>
<p>would adopt the same attitude as France.</p>
<p><b>133. </b> President Chirac stated that it was possible to have a difference of view with </p>
<p>the US. Principles and values should not be sacrificed because there was a crisis. </p>
<p>France had warned the US that it could not:</p>
<p>“… be a standard bearer for democracy and dialogue and not use every possible </p>
<p>method to avoid a war … [I]f the international community didn’t give its approval, </p>
<p>a dangerous precedent would be set if the United States bypassed the UN.”</p>
<p><b>134. </b> President Chirac added that he had told President Bush that the US had “already </p>
<p>won”. It was “highly probable” that “Iraq wouldn’t have provided the more active </p>
<p>co-operation the inspectors demanded”, if the US and the UK had not deployed such </p>
<p>significant forces.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> President Chirac made clear that although France disagreed with military action, </p>
<p>it would remain an ally of the US. It would not stop US overflights. But he warned that </p>
<p>the consequences of war would be unpredictable. Reconstruction would be required </p>
<p>which could only be done through the UN. The responsibility of restoring a viable </p>
<p>situation in Iraq and the region could not be taken on by one country alone. France </p>
<p>would have a part to play.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> In response to a question about whether war would lead to a resurgence </p>
<p>of terrorism and clashes between the different communities in France, President </p>
<p>Chirac replied:</p>
<p>“It’s certain that, if there’s war, the first victors will probably be those seeking </p>
<p>confrontation, the clash of civilisations, cultures and religions. In my opinion, a war </p>
<p>of this nature can lead only to increased terrorism.”</p>

<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>425</p>
<p><b>137. </b> President Chirac stated:</p>
<p>“… it seems to me that war is something which will break up the world coalition </p>
<p>against terrorism … we mustn’t forget that a very great majority of the world’s </p>
<p>countries and peoples are against this war … France isn’t isolated … So if there </p>
<p>is a war there is indeed a risk of a new upsurge in terrorism.”</p>
<p><b>138. </b> The headline in <i>Le Monde </i>the following day was<i> </i>“<i>Quelles que soient les </i></p>
<p><i>circonstances, la France votera non</i>”.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Commenting on the interview the following day, Sir John Holmes wrote that, “Even </p>
<p>if only in response to a question”, President Chirac had gone “out of his way to make his </p>
<p>position categoric”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“The French calculation is presumably that this makes it as hard as possible for </p>
<p>the Russians and Chinese not to follow, and as easy as possible for the swing six </p>
<p>to abstain, as an obvious middle course between the two opposing blocs. The only </p>
<p>glimmer of encouragement that I can see for us is that he may have played this </p>
<p>card too soon, apparently ruling out any flexibility even if the text of a resolution is </p>
<p>amended … We may be able to use this against the French in arguing with others. </p>
<p>I suppose it is possible in theory that … Chirac could change to an abstention. </p>
<p>But this is clutching at straws, such is the limb he has deliberately put himself on.”</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Sir John Holmes told the Inquiry that President Chirac had prepared his remarks </p>
<p>and had decided at that stage that he was “fully in opposition to … the invasion of Iraq”.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Sir John thought President Chirac had been saying: “The text, as we have it at this </p>
<p>moment, is not one we can support and we will vote against it.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Sir John stated, “There was genuine ambiguity” about what President Chirac had </p>
<p>meant: “There was scope for interpretation.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>143. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock also told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The fact was that, although the words didn’t surprise us, the fact that Chirac said </p>
<p>it at that time, in that way, was politically aggressive by the French. That was </p>
<p>the point.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>426</p>
<p><b>Events of 11 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>144.  In a press conference, Mr Blair stated that he hoped that France and Russia </b></p>
<p><b>would not talk about vetoes but try to find common ground.</b></p>
<p><b>145. </b> In a press conference following a meeting with Mr José Manuel Durao Barroso, </p>
<p>the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr Blair set out that there had been an attempt to </p>
<p>unify people around a common position based on resolution 1441 to try to disarm </p>
<p>Iraq peacefully, but if that became impossible, the international community had to be </p>
<p>“prepared to take action”.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> He also said that divisions between Europe and the US </p>
<p>would be “very damaging” and that he was:</p>
<p>“… prepared to try and find common ground, but we need others to be equally willing </p>
<p>to do so.”</p>
<p><b>146. </b> In response to a question about what more could be given to find common ground </p>
<p>with France and Russia, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… if France or any other country is simply going to say we will veto, no matter what, </p>
<p>that is obviously a very difficult position … [E]verybody, including France and Russia, </p>
<p>accepts there is not full co-operation … So I hope we won’t talk about vetoes in any </p>
<p>set of circumstances or in all sets of circumstances, but rather we<i> </i>will try and find </p>
<p>the common ground that allows us a way through here … And what we are trying to </p>
<p>do in the Security Council now is to offer very, very clear ideas as to what Iraq has to </p>
<p>do in order to demonstrate it is prepared to disarm voluntarily.</p>
<p>“But let us not be under any illusion, there is no way that Iraq will make any </p>
<p>concession or co-operate in any way without the threat of force being there …  </p>
<p>[M]y concern is that if countries talk about using a veto in all sets of circumstances, </p>
<p>the message that sends to Saddam is you are off the hook …”</p>
<p>MR STRAW’S MINUTE TO MR BLAIR</p>
<p><b>147.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that the UK and the US should not push the </b></p>
<p><b>second resolution to a vote if they could not secure nine votes and be certain </b></p>
<p><b>of avoiding any vetoes.</b></p>
<p><b>148.  Mr Straw suggested that the UK should adopt a strategy based on the </b></p>
<p><b>argument that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution </b></p>
<p><b>1441, and that the last three meetings of the Security Council “more than fulfil the </b></p>
<p><b>requirement” for Security Council consideration of reports of non-compliance.</b></p>
<p><b>149.  Mr Straw also identified the need for a “Plan B” in the event that the </b></p>
<p><b>Government failed to secure a majority in the Parliamentary Labour Party for </b></p>
<p><b>military action.</b></p>
<p>44 </p>
<p>The National Archives, 11 March 2003, <i>Press Conference: PM Blair and Portuguese PM Barroso</i>.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>427</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 11 March setting out his conclusion that:</p>
<p>“If we cannot gain nine votes and be sure of no veto, we should not push our second </p>
<p>resolution to a vote. The political and diplomatic consequences for the UK would </p>
<p>be significantly worse to have our … resolution defeated (even by just a French </p>
<p>veto alone) than if we camp on 1441. Kofi Annan’s comments last evening have </p>
<p>strengthened my already strong view on this. Getting Parliamentary approval for </p>
<p>UK military action will be difficult if there is no second resolution: but in my view </p>
<p>marginally easier by the strategy I propose.</p>
<p>“We also need to start working up a Plan B for our armed forces if we cannot be sure </p>
<p>of Commons’ approval for their inclusion in the initial invasion of Iraq.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>151. </b> Mr Straw set out his reasoning in some detail, making clear that it was predicated </p>
<p>on a veto only by France. That was “in practice less likely than two or even three </p>
<p>vetoes”. The points made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “upsides of defying a veto” had been “well aired”, including that it would </p>
<p>“show at least we had the ‘moral majority’ with us”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In public comments, he and Mr Blair had kept their “options open on what we </p>
<p>should do in the event that the resolution does not carry within the terms of </p>
<p>the [UN] Charter”. That had “been the correct thing to do”. “In private” they had </p>
<p>“speculated on what to do if we are likely to get nine votes, but be vetoed” by </p>
<p>one or more of the five Permanent Members (P5).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although in earlier discussion he had “warmed to the idea” that it was worth </p>
<p>pushing the issue to a vote “if we had nine votes and faced only a French veto”; </p>
<p>the more he “thought about this, the worse an idea it becomes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The intensive debate over Iraq in the past five months had shown “how much </p>
<p>faith” people had in the UN as an institution; and that “far from having the ‘moral </p>
<p>majority’ with us … we will lose the moral high ground if we are seen to defy the </p>
<p>very rules and Charter of the UN on which we have lectured others and from </p>
<p>which the UK has disproportionately benefitted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “best, least risky way to gain a moral majority” was “by the ‘Kosovo route’ </p>
<p>– essentially what I am recommending. The key to our moral legitimacy then </p>
<p>was the matter never went to a vote – but everyone knew the reason for this </p>
<p>was that Russia would have vetoed. (Then, we had no resolution to fall back </p>
<p>on, just customary international law on humanitarianism; here we can fall back </p>
<p>on 1441.)”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The veto had been included in the UN Charter “for a purpose – to achieve </p>
<p>a consensus”. The UK could not “sustain an argument (politically, leave </p>
<p>aside legally) that a distinction can be made between a ‘reasonable’ and an </p>
<p>‘unreasonable’ veto”. That was “a completely subjective matter”.</p>
<p>45 </p>
<p>Minute Straw to Prime Minister, 11 March 2003, ‘Iraq: What if We Cannot Win the Second Resolution?’</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>428</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “three recent meetings of the Council more than fulfil the requirement </p>
<p>for immediate consideration of reports of non-compliance. So we can say </p>
<p>convincingly that the process set out in 1441 is complete. If we push a second </p>
<p>resolution to a veto, then the last word on the Security Council record is a formal </p>
<p>rejection of a proposal that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity.”</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Straw advised that it would be “more compelling in Parliament and with public </p>
<p>opinion to take our stand on the basis of [resolution] 1441, and the overwhelming </p>
<p>evidence that Iraq has not used the four months since then to co-operate ‘immediately, </p>
<p>unconditionally and actively’”. The UNMOVIC “clusters” document would be “a material </p>
<p>help in making that case”.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that he interpreted Mr Annan’s “important” statement </p>
<p>on 10 March:</p>
<p>“… essentially as a gypsies’ warning not to try and then fail with a second resolution. </p>
<p>If the last current act of the Security Council on Iraq is 1441, we can genuinely claim </p>
<p>that we have met Kofi’s call for unity and for acting within (our interpretation of) the </p>
<p>authority of the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>154. </b> There was no reference in Mr Straw’s minute to President Chirac’s remarks the </p>
<p>previous evening.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that it would not be possible to decide what the </p>
<p>Parliamentary Labour Party and the House of Commons would agree until deliberations </p>
<p>in the Security Council had concluded. If a second resolution was agreed, it would be </p>
<p>“fine”, but that was “unlikely”. He added:</p>
<p>“I sensed yesterday that sentiment might be shifting our way; but we would need to </p>
<p>be very clear of the result before putting down a resolution approving military action. </p>
<p>We could not possibly countenance the risk of a defeat …</p>
<p>“But it need not be a disaster for you, the Government, and even more important for </p>
<p>our troops, if we cannot take an active part in the initial invasion, provided we get on </p>
<p>the front foot with our strategy.</p>
<p>“I am aware of all the difficulties of the UK standing aside from invasion operations, </p>
<p>not least given the level of integration of our forces with those of the US. But I </p>
<p>understand that the US could if necessary adjust their plan rapidly to cope without </p>
<p>us … [W]e could nevertheless offer them a major UK contribution to the overall </p>
<p>campaign. In addition to staunch political support, this would include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intelligence co-operation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>use of Diego Garcia, Fairford and Cyprus, subject to the usual consultation on </p>
<p>targeting; and</p>

<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>429</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as soon as combat operations are over, full UK participation in the military and </p>
<p>civilian tasks, including taking responsibility for a sector and for humanitarian </p>
<p>and reconstruction work. We could also take the lead in the UN on securing the </p>
<p>… resolution to authorise the reconstruction effort and the UN role in it which the </p>
<p>US now agree is necessary.”</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“We will obviously need to discuss all this, but I thought it best to put it in your mind </p>
<p>as event[s] could move fast. And what I propose is a great deal better than the </p>
<p>alternatives. When Bush graciously accepted your offer to be with him all the way, </p>
<p>he wanted you alive not dead!”</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Mr Straw’s minute was not sent to Lord Goldsmith or to Mr Geoff Hoon, the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office replied separately on 11 March to a request from </p>
<p>Sir David Manning for advice on the implications of the argument that a French veto </p>
<p>would be unreasonable.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>159. </b> The FCO advised that there was “no recognised concept of an ‘unreasonable </p>
<p>veto’”; and warned that: “In describing a French veto as ‘unreasonable’ we would </p>
<p>therefore be inviting others to describe any future vetoes as ‘unreasonable’ too.” </p>
<p>That could have implications in other areas “such as the Middle East”. In addition, </p>
<p>“describing the veto as unreasonable would make no difference to the legal position”. </p>
<p>There was “no implied condition” in the UN Charter that a veto was valid “only” if it was </p>
<p>reasonable. There was “already pressure at the UN to abolish veto rights”. And pressure </p>
<p>could be expected to increase “if the argument that certain vetoes were ‘unreasonable’ – </p>
<p>and could therefore be ignored – gained ground”.</p>
<p><b>160. </b> The UK was “on record as saying that the veto should only be used with restraint </p>
<p>and in a manner consistent with the principles of the Charter”.</p>
<p>MINISTERIAL MEETING TO DISCUSS LEGAL ISSUES AND THE MILITARY PLAN</p>
<p><b>161.  Ministers discussed legal issues, including holding the response to a US </b></p>
<p><b>request for the use of UK bases for a few days, on 11 March.</b></p>
<p><b>162.  They also discussed the viability of the military plan.</b></p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Blair held a meeting to discuss the military plan and legal issues with Mr John </p>
<p>Prescott (Deputy Prime Minister), Mr Hoon, Lord Goldsmith and Admiral Sir Michael </p>
<p>Boyce (Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)).</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>430</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull (Cabinet Secretary), Mr Powell, Mr Campbell, Baroness Morgan </p>
<p>(Mr Blair’s Director of Political and Government Relations), Sir David Manning and </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft were also present.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Mr Blair had already had a bilateral discussion with Lord Goldsmith on 11 March </p>
<p>on the legal basis for the use of military force early. That is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office wrote to No.10 on 11 March, reporting that the US </p>
<p>was pressing for a response “as soon as possible” to the letter delivered by the US </p>
<p>Ambassador to London to Mr Straw on 5 March.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> That had formally requested the </p>
<p>British Government’s agreement to the use of RAF Fairford, Diego Garcia and, possibly, </p>
<p>other British bases for military operations against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>166. </b> The FCO advised that “under international law, the UK would be responsible </p>
<p>for any US action in breach of international law in which the UK knowingly assisted”. </p>
<p>The draft response was “premised on a decision that UNSCR [UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolution] 1441 and other relevant resolutions” provided “the authority for action”.</p>
<p><b>167. </b> A minute from Mr Desmond Bowen, the Deputy Head of OD Sec, advised Sir David </p>
<p>Manning that the request was to be discussed at Mr Blair’s meeting with Lord Goldsmith, </p>
<p>Mr Straw and Mr Hoon on 11 March.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> He understood that Mr Straw and Mr Hoon had </p>
<p>copies of Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March.</p>
<p><b>168. </b> The briefing note for Mr Blair described confirmation of the viability of the overall </p>
<p>military plan as the “main purpose of the meeting”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>169. </b> The record of the meeting on 11 March stated that Mr Blair had started by </p>
<p>addressing the legal base for military action.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> He stated that Lord Goldsmith’s “advice </p>
<p>made it clear that a reasonable case could be made” that resolution 1441 was “capable </p>
<p>of reviving” the authorisation of resolution 678, “although of course a second resolution </p>
<p>would be preferable”.</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Other points recorded by Mr Rycroft included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce said he “would need to put a short paragraph [on the legal basis] </p>
<p>in his directive to members of the Armed Forces”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That “should be cleared with the Attorney General”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would send the US a positive reply on its request to use Diego Garcia </p>
<p>and RAF Fairford “in a day or two, with the usual conditions attached”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce advised that “once we had given our approval, the US </p>
<p>might give very little notice before the start of the campaign”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull asked whether a legal basis for military action was required </p>
<p>for civil servants, as well as for members of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon asked whether the Attorney General’s legal advice was ever disclosed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair asked for a quick study into the precedents for that.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce told the meeting that he was “confident that the battle plan </p>
<p>would work”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated that “we must concentrate on averting unintended consequences </p>
<p>of military action. On targeting, we must minimise the risks to civilians.”</p>
<p><b>171. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon had “said he would be happier with a clearer green light from the AG </p>
<p>[Attorney General]”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had been “really irritated” when Sir Andrew Turnbull had “said he would </p>
<p>need something to put round the Civil Service that what they were engaged in </p>
<p>was legal”. Mr Blair was “clear we would do nothing that wasn’t legal”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had provided “a version of the arguments he had put to TB, on </p>
<p>the one hand, on the other, reasonable case”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon had advised that the response to the “US request for the use of Diego </p>
<p>Garcia and [RAF] Fairford” should be that it was “not … automatic but had to go </p>
<p>round the system”. Mr Blair had said he “did not want to send a signal that we </p>
<p>would not do it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon and Mr Straw were telling Mr Blair that the US could act as early as </p>
<p>that weekend, and “some of our forces would have to be in before”.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Following the meeting, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, </p>
<p>provided an outline of the military plan for Iraq and the need for decisions on the </p>
<p>development of the UK’s role to Sir David Manning.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> That is addressed in Section 6.2.</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Ms Short recorded that she had spoken to Mr Blair on the evening of 11 March </p>
<p>about the fact that DFID had not been invited to attend the meeting “on the legality of </p>
<p>military action”, which she understood was about “the use of UK bases by the US in war, </p>
<p>but the fundamental question on whether there was legal authority for military action </p>
<p>was presumably the same”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> Mr Blair had said she would “see all” and that it had been </p>
<p>decided to defer the decision on basing. He was: “Hopeful on a second resolution.” </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had “said 1441 enough. A bit later, 1441 enough if detail available to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>Secretary Rumsfeld’s remarks, 11 March 2003</b></p>
<p>In a telephone call to Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Secretary of Defense, on 11 March </p>
<p>about the timing of military action, Mr Hoon emphasised the importance of a few extra </p>
<p>days to win over Chile and Mexico and the domestic politics in the UK.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>The MOD reported that Secretary Rumsfeld had said Gen Franks was looking at how </p>
<p>to “work around” a position in which the UK could not participate in military action </p>
<p>which assumed that the UK would be available for post-conflict activities. Mr Hoon had </p>
<p>responded that the UK would not want to be in that position and reiterated the case for </p>
<p>waiting a few more days.</p>
<p>In a subsequent press briefing, Secretary Rumsfeld said that it was unclear what the UK </p>
<p>role would be in the event that a decision was made to use force:</p>
<p>“… until we know what the resolution is, we won’t know the answer to what their role </p>
<p>will be …”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld subsequently clarified his comments, saying he had “no doubt of </p>
<p>the full support of the United Kingdom for the international community’s efforts to disarm </p>
<p>Iraq”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> Obtaining a second resolution was important to the UK, and the US was “working </p>
<p>to achieve that”. He added:</p>
<p>“In the event that a decision to use force is made, we have every reason to believe </p>
<p>that there will be a significant military contribution from the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>In his memoir Mr Blair wrote that Secretary Rumsfeld had been “trying to be helpful”, but </p>
<p>it had not helped and “by then the military were absolutely determined, rightly, that they </p>
<p>would be part of the action from the outset, and took amiss any sense that we might be </p>
<p>in the second rank”.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>In the entry for 11 March in the edition of his diaries published in 2012, Mr Campbell wrote </p>
<p>that the incident was “indicative of the difficulties” of working with the US.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> Secretary </p>
<p>Rumsfeld’s clarification was the result of a further telephone call from Mr Hoon “making it </p>
<p>clear that we were with them”.</p>

<p><b>giving a green light to war.</b></p>
<p><b>176.  President Putin also warned of the risks of military action.</b></p>
<p><b>177. </b> Following Mr Blair’s discussion with President Putin on 7 March (see Section 3.7), </p>
<p>Sir Roderic Lyne, British Ambassador to Russia, had advised Mr Ricketts on 10 March </p>
<p>that he had been considering whether there was “anything to be done at the 11th hour </p>
<p>to turn the Russians on our current text”.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> He had concluded that Russia would “only </p>
<p>move if”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the French moved;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>and/or major amendments were made to the resolution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>or if the Americans had brokered a bilateral deal so heavily weighted towards </p>
<p>Russian interests that it outweighed the downside of splitting from the </p>
<p>French position.”</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Sir Roderic added that “the Americans have now left it too late”. President Putin </p>
<p>did not “want a breach with the Americans, for well known reasons; and this explains the </p>
<p>repeated Russian encouragement … to just go ahead and do it in a way which does not </p>
<p>involve Russia in approving war”.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Stating that he was “deliberately over-simplifying”, Sir Roderic advised that </p>
<p>President Putin was not now going to “put himself out” or “take risks”, because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Americans had “not picked up Russian hints from mid-2001 onwards that </p>
<p>there is a price tag attached”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Americans “… did not cut the Russians in on the discussion. They </p>
<p>proclaimed the ‘axis of evil’, which worries the Russians mightily; they deployed </p>
<p>their forces; they then demanded acceptance of their resolution within a tight </p>
<p>time-frame and without a smoking gun or trigger. If the Russians buy into this, </p>
<p>what else are they buying into? War on N. Korea or Iran? (It’s not impossible </p>
<p>that the Russians could be brought to subscribe to a tougher approach to </p>
<p>proliferation, but they would need to be carried along stage by stage.) So the </p>
<p>Russians are very susceptible to the French line of argument that the Americans </p>
<p>are trying to drag us down a very dangerous road … and the time to make a </p>
<p>stand is now.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia had “not been given its due reward for supporting the Americans on </p>
<p>various issues, or for not opposing them on others”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia wanted freedom to act on Chechnya.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russian domestic opinion thought France and Germany were right to stand firm </p>
<p>against the US.</p>

<p><b>180. </b> In Sir Roderic’s view, the “only way we are now likely to get them [the Russians] </p>
<p>on board would be to drop the authorisation for war”. The Russians were “convinced that </p>
<p>the Americans are going to attack, come what may”.</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Sir David Manning put the email to Mr Blair on 11 March, commenting: “Good Rod </p>
<p>Lyne analysis on Putin/Iraq.”</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Putin who was ready to look for a way forward but </p>
<p>made it clear that Russia could not accept any proposition which looked like a “green </p>
<p>light for war”.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>183. </b> President Putin told Mr Blair that, following the visit to Baghdad by the Speaker of </p>
<p>the Russian Parliament, there were grounds to believe that Saddam Hussein understood </p>
<p>the necessity for disarmament, and had opted for the maximum co-operation with the </p>
<p>UN inspectors.</p>
<p><b>184. </b> President Putin also said that the Iraqis had been robust and confident and were </p>
<p>prepared to resist the Coalition; and that an initial military action might be over quickly </p>
<p>but Iraq was a big country and guerrilla warfare could continue for some time.</p>
<p><b>185.  Mr José Maria Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, told Mr Blair that he would </b></p>
<p><b>not favour putting the resolution to a vote without a guarantee of success.</b></p>
<p><b>186. </b> In a conversation with Mr Aznar, Mr Blair argued that the Spanish proposal for </p>
<p>a simple resolution needed to be combined with tests for Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Aznar identified a number of concerns about the risks with the approach, but he </p>
<p>agreed to try. He was also reported to have said that without a guaranteed win, he would </p>
<p>not favour putting the resolution to a vote.</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Blair also spoke to:</p>

<p>435</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Mr Blair sought Mr Annan’s support for the proposals he was discussing with Chile, </p>
<p>and through them Mexico, to construct “clear and specific tests that would allow us to </p>
<p>assess whether Saddam was going to come fully into compliance and had genuinely </p>
<p>changed his mind”.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>191. </b> Mr Blair stated that the tests would be tough but achievable and the timeframe </p>
<p>could be short: “The US were only prepared to accept a timeframe of days not weeks. </p>
<p>If Saddam did demonstrate his seriousness by complying with the tests then a full work </p>
<p>programme would ensue.”</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Mr Blair added that President Chirac’s comments “that he would veto a second </p>
<p>resolution in any circumstances would cause a real difficulty if they were proved true. </p>
<p>If the UN could not reach an agreement and military action took place the UN would </p>
<p>be seriously weakened.” It would be hard to achieve a compromise and the US “were </p>
<p>in no mood to negotiate further”.</p>
<p><b>193.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that, if Iraq delivered, the UK and US “might </b></p>
<p><b>have to take ‘yes’ for an answer”, and that he was reviewing whether to push for </b></p>
<p><b>a vote if it would be unsuccessful.</b></p>
<p><b>194.  Secretary Powell expressed concern about the perceived shift in the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>position given Mr Blair’s assurances that the UK would proceed if there were nine </b></p>
<p><b>votes for a resolution but a French veto.</b></p>
<p><b>195. </b> In the first of six conversations with Secretary Powell on 11 March, Mr Straw said </p>
<p>that he had sent him the latest version of the UK’s six tests, and that Mr Blair thought </p>
<p>there was a chance it would secure votes.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> He and Mr Blair would be making a series </p>
<p>of phone calls making the point that: “We’ve moved twice and won’t move again.”</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Secretary Powell was reported to have said that Ms Ana Palacio, the Spanish </p>
<p>Foreign Minister, “was concerned that the Iraqis could do something with the tests: they </p>
<p>could, for example, produce 30 scientists”. Mr Straw responded that if Iraq delivered </p>
<p>“we might have to take ‘yes’ for an answer”. Secretary Powell said that “was easier for … </p>
<p>[Mr Straw] to say than for him to accept<b>”.</b></p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Straw said Mr Blair’s plan was to get President Lagos “in the bag then get him </p>
<p>to sell the latest draft to Fox”.</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Raising the question of pushing for a vote “if we knew that would not get a result”, </p>
<p>Mr Straw warned Secretary Powell that he was “increasingly of the view that … would </p>
<p>not be in the interests of international solidarity and respect for the UN”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>436</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Secretary Powell responded that that would be “a brand new element”: Mr Blair </p>
<p>had “always said that if we had nine votes but a French veto he could work with it”.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> Mr Straw reminded Secretary Powell of their conversation the previous day, adding </p>
<p>that “he was not at all sure that here would be only one veto: two vetoes would be </p>
<p>heavy; it was better not to vote”. Mr Blair had not yet made up his mind, but his “concern </p>
<p>was which course of action would be easier to get through the House of Commons: </p>
<p>no resolution because of a veto, or no resolution because of an expected veto”.</p>
<p><b>201.  President Lagos told Mr Blair he needed more time to think about </b></p>
<p><b>the proposals.</b></p>
<p><b>202. </b> In the first of three conversations on 11 March, President Lagos confirmed that </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s proposed approach could work but he wanted more time and was still thinking </p>
<p>about the precise terms.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> Mr Blair emphasised US concerns about delay and the risk </p>
<p>of an unworkable compromise. They agreed to talk again later that day.</p>
<p><b>203.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair had made clear that the proposal </b></p>
<p><b>was the UK’s “bottom line”, and there was little flexibility in timing.</b></p>
<p><b>204.  Ms Palacio expressed scepticism about any French suggestion that with </b></p>
<p><b>more time it could be supportive.</b></p>
<p><b>205. </b> In a conference call with Secretary Powell and Ms Palacio, Mr Straw reported that </p>
<p>Mr Blair thought President Lagos had “bought the language on tests” in the proposed </p>
<p>“Side statement”, but “might try to share the language with President Chirac”.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair had made clear that the proposal “was our bottom line and also that there </p>
<p>was no flexibility on timing of the deadline (beyond 24 hours or so)”. Neither Mr Blair </p>
<p>nor Mr Straw expected any Chilean approach to France “to bring acceptable results”. </p>
<p>Secretary Powell and Ms Palacio had agreed.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> Ms Palacio was reported to have said that France had been working on the </p>
<p>assumption that nine votes would not be achieved. If that looked closer, the French </p>
<p>would “change tack and instead play for time they knew the UK, US and Spain didn’t </p>
<p>have”. Chile was convinced it “could bridge the gap” and was “likely to come back … </p>
<p>with a French offer”. France would probably try to persuade Chile (and Mexico) that it </p>
<p>“might be able to sign up to our approach, providing” there was “a little more time”. But </p>
<p>France had “absolutely no intention of signing up to anything we produced”. Any French </p>
<p>“offer” to Lagos was “highly unlikely to be anything useful”. Mr Straw and Secretary </p>
<p>Powell had agreed.</p>

<p><b>be that it was “not interested in another series of negotiations”.</b></p>
<p><b>208. </b> In a subsequent bilateral conversation, Secretary Powell and Mr Straw discussed </p>
<p>the position of Mexico and Chile.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>209. </b> Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that President Lagos had not yet spoken to </p>
<p>President Chirac. President Bush would tell President Fox that Mr Blair’s “offer was </p>
<p>all he was going to get”. The US was “not interested in another series of negotiations. </p>
<p>Any modifications would have to be made tomorrow for a vote on Thursday.”</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Reporting that Dr Rice was “showing some interest in ditching OP3” (the provision </p>
<p>that Iraq had to demonstrate it was co-operating by a defined date), Secretary Powell </p>
<p>stated that he had pointed out that President Chirac would “veto anything, explaining </p>
<p>that the simplest language was being used as a pretext for war”.</p>
<p><b>211.  The FCO asked Ambassadors in Arab countries to make clear that little time </b></p>
<p><b>was left to persuade Saddam Hussein to stand down.</b></p>
<p><b>212. </b> In a telegram on the afternoon of 11 March, the FCO stated:</p>
<p>“If the Arabs are still serious about pressing Saddam to stand aside, they need to get </p>
<p>going now without waiting for a second UN SCR. If they delay there may not be time </p>
<p>for Arab diplomacy.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p><b>213. </b> The FCO added:</p>
<p>“We are now approaching the end game on Iraq. A vote on the current draft Security </p>
<p>Council resolution is now likely this week. If this includes, as at present, a deadline </p>
<p>for Iraqi action, our assumption is that that is the end point for Arab efforts. If the </p>
<p>resolution does not pass, the window for Arab action may be very short, and might </p>
<p>not be explicit.”</p>
<p><b>214.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that they should not put the draft resolution </b></p>

<p>438</p>
<p><b>217. </b> Discussing whether it would be wise to go ahead with a vote without the support </p>
<p>of Mexico and Chile, and the different views within the US Administration, Mr Straw told </p>
<p>Secretary Powell that:</p>
<p>“… he was clear that if we did not have nine votes we should go nowhere near </p>
<p>the Security Council. Even if we did have nine votes we should not go if we knew </p>
<p>the French would veto. Annan had signalled yesterday his unhappiness with the </p>
<p>possibility of the last act of the Security Council showing it divided and fractured </p>
<p>… [H]e knew that some people in the [US] Administration did not give a fig for the </p>
<p>UN, but the US and President Bush needed the UN across a range of subjects. The </p>
<p>President could make a better speech about the negotiating history of 1441 and </p>
<p>French failure to insert a provision for a second resolution than about why we were </p>
<p>ignoring a Security Council veto.”</p>
<p><b>218. </b> Secretary Powell asked that Mr Blair should make plain to President Bush the UK’s </p>
<p>problems with a failed second resolution.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Mr Straw said that in his opinion we would “need to adapt our strategy” and that </p>
<p>the “Kosovo model might be useful. In some ways our position was now stronger: in </p>
<p>Kosovo we had relied on customary international law, whereas here we had a string of </p>
<p>resolutions culminating in 1441”. Mr Straw stressed that was his opinion and had not yet </p>
<p>been agreed with Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>220.  In a conversation with Mr Blair that evening, President Lagos confirmed he </b></p>
<p><b>was still working on a draft resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>221. </b> When Mr Blair and President Lagos spoke for a second time, President Lagos </p>
<p>confirmed that he was still working on a draft Mexican/Chilean resolution.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>222. </b> In response to a warning from Mr Blair that President Bush would not agree a </p>
<p>deadline “beyond 24 March”, President Lagos was reported to have commented that </p>
<p>he would put his preferred deadline in the draft and there could then be a negotiation.</p>
<p><b>223.  In the absence of nine votes for the resolution, Mr Straw and Secretary </b></p>
<p><b>Powell discussed not putting the resolution to a vote. They agreed the decision </b></p>
<p><b>to pull out of a vote could be explained by blaming France.</b></p>
<p><b>224.  Mr Straw stated that in four successive meetings of the UN, no-one had said </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq had fully complied. “Iraq was therefore in material breach.”</b></p>
<p><b>225. </b> When Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke again at 9pm, Secretary Powell stated </p>
<p>that the US and UK had “just about convinced President Lagos and President Fox; their </p>

<p><b>226. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair was “coming round to the view that </p>
<p>if the nine votes weren’t there, then we should not push it to a vote”. Secretary Powell </p>
<p>responded that President Bush was on the same wave-length.</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Mr Straw added that “the situation was less clear if we had nine votes but faced </p>
<p>a veto”. Secretary Powell suggested that his answer to the question of how to explain </p>
<p>pulling out of a vote in that situation would be to “blame Paris and leave”.</p>
<p><b>228. </b> Mr Straw agreed, stating they could:</p>
<p>“… point to France signing [resolution] 1441. That resolution had demanded </p>
<p>‘immediate’ co-operation, but here we were four months later. The resolution </p>
<p>had demanded ‘active’ co-operation, but Blix could not confirm that. And, in four </p>
<p>successive meetings at the UN, not one of the 15 … members had said that Iraq </p>
<p>had fully complied. Iraq was therefore in material breach.”</p>
<p><b>229. </b> Secretary Powell added that the US and UK “had worked hard to obtain a second </p>
<p>resolution, but Chirac had clearly said on 10 March that he would veto a resolution in </p>
<p>any circumstances”. Mr Straw said they could also point to Mr Annan’s statement.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> In a subsequent conversation at 10.45pm, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell </p>

<p><b>237. </b> Mr Campbell added that President Bush had described his latest telephone calls </p>
<p>with President Fox and President Lagos as “difficult”; that they “had to give us their </p>

<p>not let the date slip”.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> The record of the conversation confirms Mr Campbell’s account.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When Mr Blair had “said we needed to hold their feet to the fire”, President Bush </p>
<p>had responded that he was “waiting your instructions. If it falls apart I’m going </p>
<p>to make a speech to the American people saying I tried, and now Saddam has </p>
<p>forty-eight hours to leave the country.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair “still felt Chile would come round and not walk away”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush “felt seven days was too big a stretch to give them … Congress </p>
<p>was getting restless and all the polls were showing criticism of the UN for </p>
<p>inaction. ‘We just got to go.’”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had “said we had to do something to change the diplomatic weather and </p>
<p>get on the front foot but if we can’t get anything, we’re in real trouble and there is </p>
<p>no point in pushing the UN beyond what it will take”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush said “We know he’s not going to disarm. We already had </p>
<p>benchmarks.” He had told President Lagos “it was time to stand up and be </p>
<p>counted. I want your vote. He said no.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair said he would speak to President Lagos again, and that “a week’s delay </p>
<p>was the top end for us”. If we were “on the front foot” it would be possible to gain </p>
<p>altitude again.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush “said these guys [Presidents Fox and Lagos] were just playing </p>

<p>be no new UNSCR, that it had failed in its mission …”</p>

<p>Mr Blair felt that there had been “a bit more give” from President Putin in their </p>
<p>last call; and that “the problem was that the Chiles and Mexicos were not used </p>
<p>to making decisions as big as these …”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Campbell commented that President Bush “did not feel the need to buy more </p>
<p>time” and that he was “more impatient than ever”. He was “not really listening”.</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, reported </p>
<p>that Mr Richard Armitage, the US Deputy Secretary of State, told him on 11 March, </p>
<p>before Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, that he was “unsure whether </p>
<p>Chile and Mexico were moving in the right direction”.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> President Bush had spoken to </p>
<p>President Fox, who had “bid for a 45-day deadline”. When President Bush had “said </p>
<p>no way”, President Fox “had retreated, saying he would study the papers further”. </p>
<p>President Bush “was still trying to speak” to President Lagos.</p>
<p><b>242. </b> In response to a question from Mr Armitage about whether if it looked as though </p>
<p>there would be nine positive votes but “one or two vetoes” the UK would want to go for </p>
<p>a Security Council vote “or pull the resolution”, Mr Brenton had said that “would depend </p>
<p>crucially on calculations of how it would play in Parliament”. Mr Armitage “thought that </p>
<p>President Bush’s instinct would be to go for a vote, though the impact on the UK would </p>
<p>weigh heavily with him”.</p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Stephen Hadley, the US Deputy National Security Advisor, had been “more </p>
<p>direct”. President Bush’s “instinct would be to go for a vote on 12 March, or 13 March </p>
<p>at the latest, whatever the situation”.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Mr Kurt Volker, the US National Security Council (NSC) Director for NATO </p>
<p>and West Europe, had separately told UK officials that President Bush had rejected </p>
<p>a suggestion from Mr Aznar that the resolution might be pulled; he wanted, and </p>
<p>had promised the American people, a vote. Mr Aznar had also proposed that those </p>
<p>supporting the resolution might be asked to co-sponsor it “to act as a disincentive to </p>
<p>France and Russia to veto”. Mr Brenton and Mr Volker “agreed co-sponsorship seemed </p>
<p>a bridge too far right now”.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Mr Brenton reported that he had also been asked by both Mr Armitage and </p>
<p>Mr Hadley whether Mr Hoon’s comments to Secretary Rumsfeld meant that the UK’s </p>
<p>“determination to go in alongside the US was diminishing”. He had said “not”; the UK </p>
<p>“remained confident that we would go alongside the US” and he “assumed” that Mr Hoon </p>
<p>“had simply been setting out the Parliamentary realities” to Secretary Rumsfeld.</p>

<p><b>of 24</b> <b>March as serious.</b></p>
<p><b>247. </b> After his conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair spoke again to President </p>
<p>Lagos to say that one last effort was needed to get Saddam Hussein to comply: </p>
<p>“Ten days was adequate for him [Saddam Hussein] to make the right statements, </p>
<p>get the interviews going and produce the hidden anthrax.”</p>
<p>84</p>

<p>CONSULTATIONS IN NEW YORK</p>
<p><b>249.  After consultations on 11 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the </b></p>
<p><b>draft resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March had “no chance of </b></p>
<p><b>adoption” and that avoiding providing the US “with a new basis for the use of </b></p>
<p><b>force” was “a major criterion for most members of the Council”. The UK now </b></p>
<p><b>faced “a choice between a number of hard options”.</b></p>
<p><b>250.  Dr Blix had questioned whether it was right to describe failure to co-operate, </b></p>
<p><b>and in particular to take part in interviews, as “a very serious crime”.</b></p>
<p><b>251. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock was given authority to circulate the UK’s “language” to </p>
<p>Security Council colleagues.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> A decision on whether to speak to the French would be </p>
<p>subject to consultation with Sir Jeremy and a conversation should take place “only at </p>
<p>the end of the New York day”.</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Reporting discussions in New York on 11 March on the draft resolution and details </p>
<p>of a possible “side statement”, Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that he had discussed the </p>
<p>proposed tests with Dr Blix and Dr Dimitri Perricos, the UNMOVIC Director of Planning </p>
<p>and Operations.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>253. </b> They had raised a number of questions about the tests, the timelines for assessing </p>
<p>Iraqi actions and who would judge compliance. Dr Blix was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“concerned” about the statement that Iraq should yield proscribed items </p>
<p>“immediately” for destruction, “without delay” would be “more realistic”. </p>
<p>In addition “he wondered whether it was right to refer to a failure to co-operate </p>
<p>with UNMOVIC/IAEA, and in particular to take part in interviews, as a ‘very </p>

<p>“nervous about the concept of requiring interviewees and their families to leave </p>
<p>Iraq, but equally recognised the dangers – in terms of undue pressure – of </p>
<p>letting families remain in Iraq. He seemed to realise there was little way round </p>
<p>this, and said he would say in the Council only that this was a dilemma.”</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Dr Perricos:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“was not keen on London’s suggestion of asking for the list of all personnel </p>
<p>currently and formerly associated with Iraq’s WMD programmes … Iraq had </p>
<p>provided names and had said they were willing to provide more in particular </p>
<p>areas on request”. While it would be “possible to get the interviewees out of Iraq </p>
<p>in the timescale we envisaged, it would be difficult to interview them as well”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“did not expect anything new to arise” from the test on anthrax;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“was nervous” that the inclusion of mobile laboratories “made the whole package </p>
<p>a bit too heavy for the envisaged 7-10 day timetable” and “thought little would </p>
<p>come of it – i.e. Iraq would present legitimate facilities”. He thought that if the </p>
<p>test was kept, “it should also refer to chemical facilities and to the sites that </p>
<p>could support such mobile facilities”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“preferred to stick with the language” in Dr Blix’s letter to Dr Amir al-Sa’adi, </p>
<p>the Scientific Adviser to the Iraqi Presidency, on missile destruction, which </p>
<p>he “thought would cover all Volga engines” and “agreed our inclusion of </p>
<p>the destruction of equipment designed for the production and testing of the </p>
<p>Al Samoud 2”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“wondered whether the benchmarks would lead to a strategic shift in Iraq’s </p>
<p>behaviour though they would certainly ‘burn’ Iraq”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“underlined that while action in the time period proposed was possible, there </p>
<p>would need to be some time afterwards to assess the action taken”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“asked a number of pertinent questions” including: “Who would judge </p>
<p>compliance? Would we want to specify whether the information should go to </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and/or the Council? What would we do if Iraq gave straight denials?”</p>
<p><b>255. </b> Sir Jeremy had discussed the draft with Mr Inocencio Arias, the Spanish </p>
<p>Permanent Representative to the UN, who made “few comments”, and Ambassador </p>
<p>John Negroponte, US Permanent Representative to the UN, who was “very concerned </p>
<p>that the statement should not be part of the resolution”. Another US official had </p>
<p>commented that Washington was “intensively discussing the benchmarks ideas, but </p>
<p>he had heard no one in State or the NSC who favoured them”, thought that “it would </p>
<p>be relatively easy for the Iraqis to satisfy the tests”, and they “would not lead to the </p>
<p>US feeling any safer”.</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Sir Jeremy had also briefed Ambassador Negroponte “in general terms” on </p>
<p>possible fallback options. Ambassador Negroponte thought the side statement “would </p>
<p>not go anywhere. Mexico and Chile were asking for a lot more then we had in mind, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>444</p>
<p>including on time.” He subsequently told Sir Jeremy that President Lagos had told </p>
<p>President Bush that “he wanted 45 days and a second Council decision”.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that the draft resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain </p>
<p>on 7 March had “no chance … of adoption”. The UK now faced “a choice between a </p>
<p>number of hard options”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “light” resolution without the deadline for a decision on whether Iraq had failed </p>
<p>to take the final opportunity and no benchmarks. That would “allow each Council </p>
<p>member to interpret the text as they see fit” but had “considerable legal risks … </p>
<p>as well as appearing too obviously as cover for US military action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “light” resolution accompanied by “Blix-cleared benchmarks” while saying </p>
<p>“we were going the last mile for peace”. But Dr Blix and Dr Perricos “did not </p>
<p>think the benchmarks would necessarily be strong enough to amount to a </p>
<p>‘strategic change’ by Iraq”. There would be a “difficult choice of what to do if </p>
<p>the benchmarks were met … especially if we believed … that Iraq was still not </p>
<p>serious about complete disarmament”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “light” resolution accompanied by “stronger benchmarks”. Sir Jeremy thought </p>
<p>that Dr Blix might regard the UK list as “unreasonable for completion in the </p>
<p>timescale that we envisage”. He was inclined to chose a “Blix-approved version </p>
<p>if (if) we can bring the US along”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No resolution with or without national benchmarks.</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Sir Jeremy commented that the FCO would:</p>
<p>“… wish to consider the legal implications of each of these options. If we won an </p>
<p>adopted resolution under [the second or third] options … we would have to live with </p>
<p>the (improbable?) consequences of Saddam meeting the requirements, even if the </p>
<p>US was not in the same position.”</p>
<p><b>259. </b> Sir Jeremy added:</p>
<p>“If we do not look like winning adoption, it might be easier to make our legal case </p>
<p>if no resolution is put to the vote … we could presumably still argue that 1441 had </p>
<p>found Iraq to be in material breach and offered it a final opportunity; that it was now </p>
<p>objectively clear on the basis of the Blix reports and other emerging evidence, that </p>
<p>Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity; and that therefore the authorisation in </p>
<p>678 [1990] was revived.</p>
<p>“To the objection that we should have tested the Council we would reply (a) that a </p>
<p>Council decision was not needed under 1441 … and (b) that putting the text to the </p>
<p>vote would have been futile in the circumstances, in particular because of publicly </p>
<p>stated French intransigence.</p>
<p>“If a resolution was put to the vote and defeated, or adopted with a majority of </p>
<p>antagonistic EOVs [Explanations of Vote], it would seem harder (than it already </p>

<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>445</p>
<p>is) to assert plausibly that our intended action carried, in any sense, the implicit </p>
<p>authorisation of the UN on the basis of the revival doctrine.”</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Sir Jeremy suggested that “it was difficult to gauge, with all the fluid dynamic of </p>
<p>current telephone calls, where anyone might be on a new proposal”. The “middle ground </p>
<p>[countries]” were “constantly cross-checking with each other”. His “best judgement” was </p>
<p>that it would be worth trying the second and third options during informal discussions </p>
<p>the following afternoon. Avoiding providing the US “with a new basis for the use of force” </p>
<p>was a “major criterion for most members of the Council, and he would need to make </p>
<p>clear that the options proposed did not do that. If that revealed opposition which could </p>
<p>not be overcome, that would leave the fourth option “leaving our benchmarks out there </p>
<p>if this has better political resonance”.</p>
<p><b>261. </b> The open debate on Iraq in the Security Council on 11 and 12 March is addressed </p>
<p>later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>262.  By the end of 11 March, it was clear that Mr Blair’s efforts to persuade </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush to extend the deadline for military action, while he tried to secure </b></p>
<p><b>support from other members of the Security Council for a second resolution </b></p>
<p><b>determining that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution </b></p>
<p><b>1441, had almost reached the end of the road.</b></p>
<p><b>263.  There were also concerns that if a majority in the Council supported the </b></p>
<p><b>resolution, France, Russia and China might all exercise their veto.</b></p>
<p><b>264. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that on 11 March there was a “Growing sense of crisis”, </p>
<p>and that:</p>
<p>“We desperately need some change in the diplomatic weather. The best thing may in </p>
<p>the end be to go in without a vote because of the timings, and that once troops are </p>
<p>in there the mood changes. But short of that, which was risky enough, it was hard to </p>
<p>see how the dynamic changed.”</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr Cook wrote that on 11 March he had asked Mr Powell to press on Mr Blair </p>

<p>89</p>
<p> Mr Campbell and Mr Powell “felt it was prompted by </p>

<p><b>decided that the UK would continue to support the US.</b></p>
<p><b>270.  Mr Straw agreed.</b></p>
<p><b>271. </b> In response to a question about consideration of alternative options on the eve of </p>

<p>“… submitted formal minutes to him [Mr Blair]. This was far too serious to make </p>
<p>suggestions to him. So I thought about this a very great deal. I talked to my officials </p>
<p>and advisers in the Foreign Office and the agencies about this. I prepared a paper </p>
<p>for Mr Blair. I talked to him about it.”</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>272. </b> The Inquiry was told by a witness it agreed not to identify that, in a meeting on </p>

<p>had “the final opportunity to decide on a different track”.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> Mr Straw had suggested to </p>
<p>Mr Blair that he had a “way out and why don’t you take it”. The witness had been “struck” </p>
<p>by “the speed” and the “absolute insistence” of Mr Blair’s response: “he had got his </p>

<p>than those who publicly and openly declared themselves, like Robin Cook and </p>
<p>certain ministers, who later resigned over the absence of a second resolution.</p>
<p>“It is correct that Jack, shortly before we were due to go in, warned me of the </p>
<p>political perils of doing so. I was well aware of them. But for me the issue was </p>
<p>straightforward: we had got the US to go down the UN route and give Saddam </p>
<p>a final chance; he had not taken it; such co-operation as there was, was under </p>
<p>the duress of military action; if we backed away now, it would have disastrous </p>
<p>consequences for a tough stance on WMD and its proliferation; and for our strategic </p>
<p>relationship with the US, our key ally.”</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Asked whether his position was one of advocating to Mr Blair that he should not </p>
<p>commit British troops to military action, Mr Straw told the Inquiry that was “probably </p>
<p>putting it too strongly”.</p>

<p><b>278. </b> Mr Straw added that he:</p>

<p>had “never wanted to give the false impression that when it came to it over the </p>
<p>weekend [of 15 to 16 March] and then the decision on 17 [March] my position </p>
<p>was anything [other] than thoroughly to endorse the decision we did come to, </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“owed” Mr Blair the “best and most robust advice I could give him”.</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Straw confirmed that the anonymous witness had given “a fair summary” </p>
<p>of both his and Mr Blair’s positions.</p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Straw also stated:</p>
<p>“The interesting thing … was that from an early stage it was the Chief of the Defence </p>
<p>Staff who had argued very strongly that if we were going to get involved in the </p>
<p>military action, the Army had to be there, because they would be unhappy and </p>
<p>cross if they weren’t. I don’t trivialise the way it was put across … So we could have </p>
<p>provided facilitation and then go[ne] in afterwards … which would not have meant </p>
<p>standing down the troops we had in theatre and it was essentially what the Spanish </p>
<p>and the Italians did.”</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Section 6.1 concludes that none of the key decision-takers regarded the question </p>
<p>of whether the Army would be unhappy if it did not participate in combat operations as </p>
<p>a decisive factor in the decision on 31 October 2002 to offer ground forces to the US </p>
<p>for planning purposes.</p>
<p><b>282. </b> Describing the circumstances in which he had sent the minute of 11 March, </p>
<p>Mr Straw wrote in his memoir, that, after his speech in the Security Council on 7 March, </p>
<p>he had been:</p>
<p>“… convinced that unless there was a last-minute change of attitude by Saddam, for </p>
<p>which I hoped and prayed, war was inevitable. Whether the UK would be part of the </p>
<p>invasion was still unclear though … it was still far from certain that we could win a </p>
<p>vote on war in the Commons.”</p>

<p><b>283.  Mr Campbell recorded the concerns about the US approach which were </b></p>
<p><b>discussed in the meeting.</b></p>
<p><b>284. </b> Describing the discussion with Mr Straw in the edition of his diaries published </p>
<p>in 2012, Mr Campbell wrote that he and Mr Powell had concluded that Mr Rumsfeld’s </p>
<p>comments and the telephone call from Mr Murdoch on 11 March had “effectively been </p>
<p>a pincer movement”. The former had “forced” the UK “to come out strong” in support </p>
<p>of the US in the event of military action.</p>

<p>PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 12 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>287.  In Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on 12 March, Mr Blair focused on </b></p>
<p><b>efforts to secure a second resolution and the importance for the UN of being </b></p>
<p><b>seen to act in response to Saddam Hussein’s failure to co-operate as required </b></p>
<p><b>by resolution 1441 and of achieving unity in the international community.</b></p>
<p><b>288.  In a clear reference to President Chirac’s statement on 10 March but without </b></p>
<p><b>naming France, Mr Blair drew attention to the difficulties created by countries </b></p>
<p><b>saying that they would veto a resolution “whatever the circumstances”.</b></p>
<p><b>289.  Mr Blair also stated that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the UK would not do anything which did not have a proper legal basis; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>it was the Government’s intention to seek a vote on a second resolution </b></p>
<p><b>“in a way that most upholds the authority of the UN”.</b></p>

<p><b>291. </b> Mr Rycroft reported that Mr Errera had told him that President Chirac’s comment </p>
<p>about a veto:</p>
<p>“… needed to be read in the context of what had been said immediately before </p>
<p>about two hypotheses – either our resolution gets nine votes or it doesn’t. In other </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>450</p>
<p><b>293. </b> In relation to the policy the questions included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Peter Bradley (Labour) asked Mr Blair which was the lesser evil, allowing </p>
<p>more time for disarmament or dividing the international community “particularly </p>
<p>in view of the French President’s commitment to exercise his veto”. He also </p>
<p>asked for an assurance that he would resist US pressure while there was a </p>
<p>prospect of rebuilding the international coalition under the authority of the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, asked whether there would be </p>
<p>a vote in the UN and whether the US would go to war without the UK if there </p>
<p>was no second resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Barry Sheerman (Labour) asked Mr Blair to use all his efforts to tell President </p>
<p>Bush that we needed another UN resolution and that there was “no need for an </p>
<p>unseemly haste to war”.</p>
<p><b>294. </b> The points made by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He was doing “everything” he could “to make sure that the international </p>
<p>community stays united and that we achieve a second resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although he had not complied for “many months”, there was still time for </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to avert conflict.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “worst thing that could happen” was for Saddam Hussein to defy the clearly </p>
<p>expressed will of the UN and for no action to follow.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was the Government’s intention to seek a UN vote on a second resolution </p>
<p>“in a way that most upholds the authority of the UN”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “should not take military action unless it is in our interests to do so. </p>
<p>It is the British national interest that must be upheld at all times.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In working “flat out” for a second resolution, Mr Blair said the UK was “looking </p>
<p>at whether we can set out a clear set of tests for Iraq … to demonstrate that it is </p>
<p>still in compliance – not partial compliance …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… not one Iraqi scientist has been interviewed outside Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq should produce the unmanned aerial vehicles, which can spray chemical </p>
<p>and biological poison …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If we set out those conditions clearly, and back them with a will of a united UN, </p>
<p>we have a chance even now of averting conflict. What we must show, however, </p>
<p>is the determination to act if Saddam will not comply fully.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military action had been “delayed precisely in order to bring the international </p>
<p>community back round the position … set out in 1441”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “heart of the agreement” of the US “to take the multilateral path of the </p>
<p>United Nations” was that the “other partners inside the United Nations agreed </p>
<p>that, if Saddam did not fully comply and was in material breach, serious </p>
<p>consequences and actions would follow”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would “be a tragedy for the UN” if it failed “to meet the challenge”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>451</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Everyone accepted that Saddam Hussein was not co-operating fully with the </p>
<p>United Nations: “[N]ot a single person … in Europe; not a single person in the </p>
<p>rest of the world – believes that he is co-operating either fully or unconditionally, </p>
<p>and certainly not immediately.”</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked if the Attorney </p>
<p>General had advised that a war in Iraq would be legal in the absence of a second </p>
<p>resolution authorising force; Mr Richard Shepherd (Conservative) asked why a UN </p>
<p>resolution was required; and Mr John Randall (Conservative) asked if Mr Blair would </p>
<p>publish the legal advice.</p>
<p><b>296. </b> In response, the points made by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As he had “said on many occasions … we … would not do anything that did not </p>
<p>have a proper legal basis”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 provided the legal basis and the second resolution was “highly </p>
<p>desirable to demonstrate the will of the international community”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not the convention to publish legal advice but it was “the convention to </p>
<p>state clearly that we have a legal base for whatever action we take, and … we </p>
<p>must have such a base”.</p>
<p><b>297. </b> In response to a question from Mr Kennedy about whether Mr Annan had said that </p>
<p>action without a second resolution would breach the UN Charter, Mr Blair stated that </p>
<p>Mr Annan had said that it was “important that the UN comes together”. Mr Blair added </p>
<p>that it was:</p>
<p>“… complicated to get that agreement … when one nation is saying that whatever </p>
<p>the circumstances it will veto a resolution.”</p>
<p><b>298. </b> Mr Alan Howarth (Conservative) asked whether Mr Blair agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>divisions in the international community only gave “comfort and opportunity to </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that “a deadline receding into the summer haze was not a serious interpretation </p>
<p>of ‘serious consequences’” as the Security Council had unanimously agreed in </p>
<p>November 2002; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>given Saddam Hussein’s motive and capacity to equip terrorists with chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons, there was an urgent necessity to disarm him whether </p>
<p>there was a second resolution or not.</p>
<p><b>299. </b> Mr Blair replied that Mr Howarth had set out “precisely why we need to take </p>
<p>action”. Leaving troops in the region “for months on an indefinite time scale, without </p>
<p>insisting that Saddam disarms, would send not only a message of weakness … to </p>
<p>Saddam, but a message of weakness throughout the world”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>452</p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“I hope that even now those countries that are saying they would use their veto no </p>
<p>matter what the circumstances will reconsider and realise that by doing so they put </p>
<p>at risk not just the disarmament of Saddam, but the unity of the United Nations.”</p>
<p><b>301. </b> Mr Duncan Smith also asked, in the light of Ms Short’s comments on 9 March, </p>
<p>whether the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility applied to the option of committing British </p>
<p>forces without a second resolution. Mr Blair replied: “Yes of course it does.”</p>
<p><b>302. </b> In response to a question from Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru), about whether the </p>
<p>House of Commons would have a vote on whether to commit troops, Mr Blair replied </p>
<p>that it was:</p>
<p>“… subject to the security and safety of our troops … it is right that this House has a </p>
<p>say on this issue. People will then be able to see the stand that we take, and people </p>
<p>will then have to make up their minds as to the stand that they take.”</p>
<p><b>303. </b> In response to a question from Mr James Gray (Conservative) asking if Mr Blair </p>
<p>felt he needed the support of the Parliamentary Labour Party, the House of Commons </p>
<p>and the country as a whole, as well as the majority support he commanded in Cabinet, </p>
<p>before committing the UK to war, Mr Blair replied that as well as a vote in the House of </p>
<p>Commons it was:</p>
<p>“… important that I set out, as Prime Minister, what I believe to be right in this </p>
<p>country’s national interest. I have tried to do that over the past few months …”</p>
<p>SIR JEREMY GREENSTOCK’S PROPOSAL TO REVISE THE DRAFT RESOLUTION </p>
<p>OF 7 MARCH</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock suggested early on the afternoon of 12 March that in the </p>
<p>Security Council that day the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>table a revised draft resolution explaining that the UK was “setting aside the </p>
<p>ultimatum concept” in operative paragraph 3 of the draft of 7 March “because </p>
<p>it had not attracted Council support”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>distribute the side statement with tests for Saddam Hussein, “explaining that the </p>
<p>text was a national position to which the UK wanted as many Council Members </p>
<p>as possible to adhere to maintain the pressure on Saddam”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>state that the 17 March date was “being reviewed”.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>305. </b> Sir Jeremy favoured using the open debate in the Security Council later that day to </p>
<p>explain the UK move, adding: “At no point will I signal, in public or in private, that there is </p>
<p>any UK fallback from putting this new text to a vote within 24-36 hours.”</p>

<p>Negroponte who was briefing Secretary Powell for a conversation with President Bush.</p>
<p>SIR JEREMY GREENSTOCK’S MEETING WITH MR ANNAN</p>
<p><b>307.  Sir Jeremy reported that Mr Annan had asked how it could be right, when </b></p>
<p><b>the Council had not yet reached a decision to authorise force, for some Member </b></p>
<p><b>States to take the right to use force into their own hands.</b></p>
<p><b>308. </b> At Mr Annan’s request, Sir Jeremy Greenstock called on him on 12 March.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Mr Annan was reported to have told Sir Jeremy that he had an idea from his </p>
<p>telephone calls with Mr Blair about the UK efforts to unite the Security Council around </p>
<p>compromise text (for a resolution), but how would France and Russia react? Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>explained the UK concept of a side statement and tests which Saddam Hussein could </p>
<p>meet “within the tight deadline we would offer (ideally 10 days)” if he “was serious about </p>
<p>disarming”. Council members “should be able to agree the concept we were offering as </p>
<p>a way out of the current impasse”.</p>
<p><b>310. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had stressed that the UK’s objective “was the </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq by peaceful means if possible”. The “aim was to keep a united </p>
<p>Security Council at the centre of attempts to disarm Iraq”, but calls for “grace period for </p>
<p>Iraq” of 45 days or longer were “out of the question”. The UK would not amend the draft </p>
<p>resolution tabled on 7 March:</p>
<p>“… until it was clear that the new concept had a chance of succeeding. If the Council </p>
<p>was interested, we might be able to move forward in the next day or so; if not, we </p>
<p>would be back on the 7 March text and my instructions were to take a vote soon.”</p>
<p><b>311. </b> Sir Jeremy and Mr Annan had also discussed press reporting, on 11 March, of </p>
<p>Mr Annan’s comments, “to the effect that military action without a Council authorisation </p>
<p>would violate the UN Charter”. Mr Annan said that he had been:</p>
<p>“… misquoted: he had not been attempting an interpretation of 1441 but merely </p>
<p>offering, in answer to a specific question, obvious thoughts about the basic structure </p>
<p>of the Charter. Nevertheless the Council was seized of the Iraq problem and working </p>
<p>actively on it. It had not yet reached a decision to authorise force; how … could it be </p>
<p>right for some Member States to take the right to use force into their own hands?”</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had “remonstrated that the Council was in paralysis: </p>
<p>at least one Permanent Member had threatened to veto ‘in any circumstances’. The </p>
<p>Council was not shouldering its responsibilities.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Mr Annan “had agreed ruefully”, but asked what the UK would do if we failed to get </p>
<p>even nine votes. Sir Jeremy said:</p>
<p>“… we would have to consider the next steps; but we believed we had a basis for </p>
<p>the use of force in existing resolutions (based on the revival of the 678 authorisation </p>
<p>by the material breach finding in OP1 of 1441, coupled with Iraq’s manifest failure to </p>
<p>take the final opportunity offered to it in that resolution) … OP12 … did not in terms </p>
<p>require another decision. This was not an accidental oversight: it had been the basis </p>
<p>of the compromise that led to the adoption of the resolution.”</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had “urged” Mr Annan “to be cautious about allowing </p>
<p>his name to be associated too closely with one legal view of a complicated and </p>
<p>difficult issue”.</p>
<p><b>315. </b> At Mr Annan’s suggestion, Sir Jeremy subsequently gave the UN Office of Legal </p>
<p>Affairs a copy of Professor Christopher Greenwood’s (Professor of International Law, </p>
<p>London School of Economics) memorandum to the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) </p>
<p>of October 2002 and Mr Straw’s evidence to the FAC on 4 March 2003.</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that Mr Annan had said “several times” that he “understood” </p>
<p>what Mr Straw and Mr Blair “were trying to do, and expressed sympathy for the tough </p>
<p>situation you found yourselves in”. Mr Aznar was “in a similar predicament”. The “US did </p>
<p>not always realise how comments intended by US politicians for US domestic audiences </p>
<p>seriously damaged the position of their friends in other countries”.</p>
<p><b>317. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that, in a conversation with President Chirac on 12 March, </p>
<p>Mr Annan had “found him ‘tough but not closed’ to possible compromises”.</p>
<p>MR STRAW’S CONVERSATION WITH MR IGOR IVANOV</p>
<p><b>318.  Mr Straw informed Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK was about to table a revised resolution, omitting the paragraph from the </b></p>
<p><b>7</b> <b>March draft which contained the deadline of 17 March for Iraq to demonstrate </b></p>
<p><b>that it had taken the final opportunity offered in resolution 1441 to comply with </b></p>
<p><b>its obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>319. </b> Mr Straw telephoned Mr Ivanov to inform him that Sir Jeremy Greenstock was </p>
<p>about to table a “much lighter draft second resolution”, which omitted the third operative </p>
<p>paragraph from the draft of 7 March.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> Mr Straw explained that the UK “did not want </p>
<p>the last act of the UN on Iraq to be a deeply divided one”; the “imperatives” in resolution </p>
<p>1441 had not been met; and that neither Mr Blair nor Mr Straw “wanted military action, </p>
<p>nor did Powell or Bush”. The US and the UN inspectors had “agreed” the tests the </p>
<p>UK would propose in a side statement. The format of the tests would be for the UN </p>
<p>to decide.</p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 12 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>321.  Mr Blair decided not to seek to extend the deadline of 17 March. In a </b></p>

<p><b>324. </b> On the afternoon of 12 March, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the latest </p>
<p>position and the difficulties with Chile and Mexico.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>325. </b> In preparation for the call, Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair that he needed “to decide if </p>
<p>you want to ask for the further week”.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> If he did, Mr Blair could “make the case for trying </p>
<p>over the next 24 hours to secure a UN resolution based on the Blix agreed tests with the </p>
<p>revised deadline of 24 March (or whatever he [President Bush] accepts)”.</p>
<p><b>326. </b> If Mr Blair decided not to make the case for more time or it was rejected by </p>
<p>President Bush, Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair to set out a “fallback”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had “not given up hope of trying to secure a second resolution” and he </p>
<p>knew that President Bush “wanted to get out of the UN morass”, but he needed </p>
<p>“a further 24 hours” to see if he could “get the Chileans to put forward a </p>
<p>serious proposal”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “important” that the US did not “publicly lose interest in the UN route” </p>
<p>because of concerns that an alternative resolution with a “long, e.g. 45-day, </p>
<p>time-line” could be put forward which “could attract 11 votes”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>He had publicly set out the “Blix-agreed tests” and “also argued that because of </p>
<p>President Chirac’s threat of a veto in any circumstances, it is difficult to see how </p>
<p>the UN can uphold 1441”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He planned to put the issue to a vote in Parliament.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> Mr Rycroft suggested that Mr Blair should ask President Bush for help to win </p>
<p>the vote in Parliament by stating publicly that he would publish the Road Map for the </p>
<p>Middle East and make a commitment to further UN resolutions, establishing a UN role </p>
<p>in reconstruction and humanitarian issues and in running the Oil-for-Food programme </p>
<p>post-conflict.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> In the discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair argued that the US and UK should </p>
<p>continue to seek a compromise in the UN and show that they were reasonable by setting </p>
<p>out the tests, but he knew it would not happen.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> Mr Blair would say publicly that the </p>
<p>French had prevented them from securing a resolution, so there would not be one.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed continuing the diplomatic route until </p>
<p>Sunday, 16 March and then closing it down.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> Mr Blair said he wanted to avoid a gap between the end of the negotiating process </p>
<p>and the House of Commons vote planned for the following week; and to minimise the </p>
<p>risk of an unhelpful French initiative. He would “have to pull out all the stops to win </p>
<p>the vote”.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a US ultimatum to Saddam to leave;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the military timetable;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for a communications strategy with an initiative each day before the </p>
<p>start of military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for initiatives on the Road Map; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a US statement on the need for a further UN resolution on post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Sir David Manning would pursue the details with Dr Rice.</p>
<p><b>333. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:</p>
<p>“Bush said his people had watched TB at PMQs and said he was brilliant. TB said </p>
<p>he had spoken to Lagos and the Chileans … Bush said Fox had told him he would </p>
<p>get back to him within an hour and then went off to hospital … TB laid it on the line </p>
<p>that we had to have a vote in the Commons. He said we couldn’t pull the plug on UN </p>
<p>negotiating because the bigger the gap between the end of the negotiation and the </p>
<p>Commons motion, the worse it was for us. We had to keep trying.</p>

<p>“Bush said when do you anticipate a vote? TB said we had pencilled in next </p>
<p>Tuesday. Bush: ‘Erm.’ Long pause. TB: ‘You want to go on Monday?’ Correct. TB: </p>
<p>‘My military have given me formal advice re the full moon.’ It’s not a problem, said </p>
<p>Bush … TB said he would have to check it out. There was a clear tension between </p>
<p>Bush wanting sooner and TB wanting later.</p>
<p>“Bush was clear that the French position meant no UNSCR. But we were still trying </p>
<p>to be reasonable. He felt that on withdrawal of the resolution he would give a speech </p>
<p>saying the diplomatic phase is over, issue a 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam, say late </p>
<p>Friday, which takes us to Sunday.</p>
<p>“TB went over the politics here, how we were pulling out every stop. TB said the </p>
<p>Tories would see this as their chance to get rid of him, support us on a war motion, </p>
<p>but not a confidence motion.</p>
<p>“Bush said they would make it clear to the Tories that if they moved to get rid of TB </p>
<p>‘we will get rid of them’…</p>
<p>“The French had definitely allowed themselves to be presented as the unreasonable </p>
<p>ones, which was probably swinging opinion our way a bit, but it was still very </p>
<p>difficult. TB said it was important we still showed we were trying to be reasonable. </p>
<p>But he said if Bush could delay his broadcast till after our Commons vote, it would </p>
<p>help. Sunday, say you’ve tried, the French are being impossible, we are working </p>
<p>the phones. Monday, we take it to Parliament and say we must bring this to a </p>
<p>conclusion. Vote Tuesday. Forty-eight hours you go to their people and say war. </p>
<p>The best argument we had is that we don’t want our foreign policy decided by </p>
<p>the French, though TB was clear again that Rumsfeld’s comments had given us </p>
<p>a problem.</p>
<p>“He [Mr Blair] then started to press on the Middle East and said if Bush would </p>
<p>commit to publishing the Road Map, that would be a big breakthrough. We needed </p>
<p>a fresh UNSCR on the humanitarian situation post-conflict. Nobody doubts us on </p>
<p>the tough side of things, but it’s Middle East, humanitarian, democracy in Iraq, that </p>
<p>people want to hear about.</p>
<p>“TB spelled out the symbolism in the Road Map. Bush didn’t quite get it but he was </p>
<p>willing to do it … But TB really pressed on him and he got it in the end. Bush said </p>
<p>that we had to watch out for the French, that they would be worried they had got </p>
<p>themselves into a ridiculous position.”</p>

<p><b>335.  A meeting on 15 March was proposed before the UK withdrew the draft </b></p>
<p><b>resolution on 17 March. The US would issue a 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein to leave.</b></p>
<p><b>336. </b> After the conversation between President Bush and Mr Blair, Mr Campbell and </p>
<p>Sir David Manning each spoke to the White House.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Reporting his conversation with Mr Bartlett, Mr Campbell advised that the </p>
<p>US would need to respond quickly with a “we’re going in” message once it was clear </p>
<p>that the UN process had collapsed.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> Given the potential impact on opinion in the </p>
<p>Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Campbell asked that the UK should be consulted about </p>
<p>the US message.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Mr Campbell also reported a suggestion for a meeting on neutral territory on </p>
<p>Saturday (15 March) to “show continued efforts on the diplomatic front, and tactically, </p>
<p>to forestall any French ruse. The plan would be to indicate continued strategising around </p>
<p>the draft UNSCR.” That would “fill the void” and “would mean that any UN talks collapse </p>
<p>would be delayed to Monday”.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Mr Campbell’s view was that the perception that Mr Blair and President Bush </p>
<p>were “making a ‘last push for peace’ was fine; ‘Council of War’ was less so”. He feared </p>
<p>it would be seen as the latter. Dr Rice would discuss the idea with Sir David Manning. </p>
<p>Ending the process on 14 March, with a debate in the House of Commons on 15 March, </p>
<p>was also a possibility.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that publishing the Road Map that weekend </p>
<p>was “critical” for the UK; “it had huge symbolic significance in the Middle East” and in </p>
<p>the UK.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> “It might be worth 50 votes to the Government” which “could make all the </p>
<p>difference” in the Parliamentary debate.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice discussed the UK intention to withdraw its draft resolution on </p>
<p>Monday, 17 March; “news management would be critical in the next four or five days”.</p>
<p><b>342. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that:</p>
<p>“… we could fill a lot of column inches in the next 36 hours with the activity at the </p>
<p>UN. Jeremy Greenstock would be making great play today with our six tests … </p>
<p>This should get us through today, and with any luck comment and follow-up would </p>
<p>carry us through tomorrow. Friday might be a short day at the UN anyway. But it </p>
<p>would be good to publish the Road Map then.”</p>
<p><b>343. </b> The US proposed a meeting. Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the timings </p>
<p>of a US ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave, the UK Parliamentary debate and the </p>
<p>beginning of military action.</p>

<p><b>346.  Mr Straw told Sir Jeremy Greenstock not to table the UK’s revised draft </b></p>
<p><b>resolution, only a “non-paper” setting out “six tests”.</b></p>
<p><b>347. </b> After Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, Mr Straw spoke three times </p>
<p>to Secretary Powell.</p>
<p><b>348. </b> In their first conversation at 4.30pm, Secretary Powell asked for clarification of </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s instructions in the light of his activity on a new resolution. </p>
<p>Mr Straw explained that Secretary Rumsfeld’s intervention had “complicated matters” </p>
<p>in the UK:</p>
<p>“We now had to go even further to show we were pursuing an alternative to </p>
<p>automatic war. Greenstock’s instructions came from himself and the Prime Minister. </p>
<p>He had already spoken to Ivanov and Alvear [Mrs Soledad Alvear, the Chilean </p>
<p>Foreign Minister] about the new draft.”</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>349. </b> Following further discussion about the US position that the UN route was </p>
<p>exhausted and their concerns about the UK activity in the UN, Mr Straw told Secretary </p>
<p>Powell that “nonetheless it was important to go through the motions”. The chance </p>
<p>of success was “one per cent” but “if Jeremy succeeded we would have to go for it”. </p>
<p>Mr Straw added: “But there was a ninety nine per cent chance that this would simply </p>
<p>be for PR.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>460</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Mr Straw reassured Secretary Powell that, since their first conversation, Mr Simon </p>
<p>McDonald, his Principal Private Secretary, had spoken to Sir Jeremy “to ask him to </p>
<p>push but not too hard”. In the light of Secretary Powell’s continuing concern, Mr Straw </p>
<p>“repeated that there was only a one percent chance of success but it gave us room to </p>
<p>make the case here”.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Separately, Mr Straw spoke to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who was with Ambassador </p>
<p>Negroponte, to ask him “not formally to introduce anything this afternoon but to say that </p>
<p>we were consulting about the six tests which had already been made public”.</p>
<p><b>355. </b> Mr Brenton reported that the US Administration’s “impatience” was “growing over </p>
<p>the delay at the UN”, and that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“However much they want to help us obtain UN backing, they are equally </p>
<p>determined to get on with the job of tackling Saddam. Minds are increasingly </p>
<p>moving in the direction of abandoning the diplomatic pursuit of the ‘undecided </p>
<p>six’, and focusing instead on firming up a coalition of the willing.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The latest opinion polls showed “increased impatience with the UN process, with </p>
<p>some 55 percent … prepared to support a war without a new UNSCR. Chirac in </p>
<p>particular is seen as the villain of the piece for threatening an unreasonable veto </p>
<p>under all circumstances.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A White House spokesman had told the daily press conference that President </p>
<p>Bush “was confident that the UK would be with the US in the endeavour to </p>
<p>disarm Saddam from a military point of view”.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>356. </b> Mr Brenton had been told by senior US officials that President Bush would have </p>
<p>washed his hands of the Security Council long ago, but he was determined that, </p>
<p>whatever, “within reason”, Mr Blair needed, he should get. That included the possibility </p>
<p>of UN discussions continuing into the following week if necessary. It did not, however, </p>
<p>extend to movement on the operational timetable. He had been advised that there </p>
<p>was no US willingness to shift the dates to assist a process which seemed to be </p>

<p>461</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Mr Mohamed Aldouri, Iraqi Permanent Representative to the UN, who spoke at the </p>
<p>beginning and end of the debate, stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK had propagated “falsehoods and untrue allegations” </p>
<p>about “Iraq’s compliance and implementation of the relevant Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ninety-five percent of the disarmament tasks had been completed between </p>
<p>1991 and 1994.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix had reported on 7 March that Iraq was “proactively co-operating”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “no obstacles” to inspections, which were “serious, effective </p>
<p>and immediate”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had recently unilaterally declared its missile programme and was destroying </p>
<p>the Al Samoud 2 missiles which UNMOVIC had deemed to be proscribed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>None of the “allegations” presented to the Council by Secretary Powell on </p>
<p>5 February had “proved to be true”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The most recent “intelligence report produced by the UK” (the No.10 dossier </p>
<p>‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’ – see </p>
<p>Section 4.3), contained previously published information.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was important for Iraq to view the “clusters” document presented on 7 March </p>
<p>“in order to implement” the main tasks required “as soon as possible and to </p>
<p>study such questions and answer them”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Recent allegations about RPVs were unfounded. They were small experimental </p>
<p>aircraft which had been examined by the inspectors.</p>
<p><b>359. </b> In both his opening and closing statements, Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had “taken </p>
<p>the strategic decision” to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction. In his concluding </p>
<p>statement, he warned that war would bring “incalculable catastrophe”, and asked for </p>
<p>time to provide what evidence Iraq could to the international community to prove it had </p>
<p>no weapons of mass destruction. He appealed to the Security Council not to “stand idly </p>
<p>by” in the face of the “clear, present and serious” threat to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> A number of states supported the draft resolution tabled by the US, UK and Spain, </p>
<p>giving Iraq a deadline, including Kuwait, Australia and Japan. The majority, however, </p>
<p>argued that inspections should be given more time in an effort to avoid war.</p>
<p>PRESENTATION OF THE UK’S POSITION</p>
<p><b>361.  UK diplomatic posts were informed that the UK was “working flat out for </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution”, and there was a possibility of a short extension of the </b></p>
<p><b>deadline of 17 March.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>462</p>
<p><b>362. </b> On the evening of 12 March, Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle East and </p>
<p>North Africa, sent out a personal telegram to Heads of UK Missions, informing them that:</p>
<p>“All efforts from the Prime Minister downwards are focused on securing at least nine </p>
<p>positive votes for a second SCR. To help the middle ground of the Council, we have </p>
<p>amended our original draft [resolution] to include an ultimatum (currently 17 March, </p>
<p>with a possibility of further softening) and are discussing some tests designed to </p>
<p>show whether Iraq is prepared to make a strategic decision to comply fully with the </p>
<p>Security Council’s demands.”</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>363. </b> The telegram summarised the tests and stated:</p>
<p>“The hope is that these objective tests, plus a short extension of the 17 March </p>
<p>deadline, might deliver positive votes from Mexico and Chile. With their support, </p>
<p>plus positive votes from Bulgaria (certain), the three Africans (reasonably secure), </p>
<p>Pakistan (not so certain) we would have the nine positive votes required …</p>
<p>“The threat of vetoes by France, Russia and perhaps even China is real. It </p>
<p>remains to be seen if they will take this step if they are convinced that nine positive </p>
<p>votes are in the bag. But Chirac has virtually committed himself to a veto in any </p>
<p>circumstances, and the Russian line is firmly against any automatic recourse to </p>
<p>force. The final denouement in New York will be before the end of the week …”</p>
<p><b>364. </b> The telegram stated that decisions on UK participation in military action would </p>
<p>“depend on the outcome in New York and a debate and vote in the House of Commons, </p>
<p>likely to be on 17 March”.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Heads of Mission were told that the telegram was for “background”; and that:</p>
<p>“… in any private conversation, even with trusted interlocutors, you should not </p>
<p>speculate but rest for the moment on the fact that we are working flat out for a </p>
<p>second resolution which reunites the Council and puts the pressure back where </p>
<p>it belongs, on Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Chaplin added that if the resolution passed “and assuming the Iraqi regime fails </p>
<p>the tests set for it (there is absolutely no sign of Saddam Hussein preparing a U-turn), </p>
<p>we can assume military action would follow quickly after the expiry of the ultimatum”. </p>
<p>If the resolution did not pass, the timetable was “much more uncertain”. The Americans </p>
<p>would “not want to delay long”. Mr Straw had decided that the UK “would not want to </p>
<p>get ahead of US travel advice” which would “squeeze the time available for UK citizens </p>
<p>[in the region] who want to get out”.</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Chaplin commented that Heads of Mission had been receiving “plenty of </p>
<p>guidance in the form of ministerial statements and reports from UKMIS New York on </p>
<p>117 </p>

<p>as we enter the end game”. Events were “moving pretty fast” and they should not be </p>

<p>CONSULTATIONS ON UK PROPOSALS TO IDENTIFY KEY TESTS FOR IRAQ</p>
<p><b>368.  As agreed by Mr Blair and Mr Straw, the UK’s draft tests were circulated in </b></p>
<p><b>a meeting of Security Council members late on 12 March where they attracted a </b></p>
<p><b>mixed response. It was recognised that the UK was making “a real effort” to find </b></p>
<p><b>a way forward; but there was “no breakthrough”.</b></p>
<p><b>369.  France, Germany and Russia focused on UNMOVIC’s identification of key </b></p>
<p><b>disarmament tasks and a work programme, as required by resolution 1284 (1999).</b></p>
<p><b>370.  Dr Blix said UNMOVIC would be seeking comments on its proposals on </b></p>
<p><b>14 March.</b></p>
<p><b>371. </b> The UK circulated its draft side statement setting out the six tests to a meeting of </p>
<p>Security Council members in New York on the evening of 12 March.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> The draft omitted </p>
<p>an identified date for a deadline and included the addition of a final clause stating that:</p>
<p>“The United Kingdom reserves its position if Iraq fails to take the steps required of it.”</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Council members that the UK “non-paper”, setting </p>
<p>out six tasks to be achieved in a 10-day timeline, responded to an approach from the </p>
<p>undecided six (U-6) looking for a way forward.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Sir Jeremy said he had consulted Dr Blix and Dr Perricos, but the list was the </p>
<p>responsibility of the UK, which was:</p>
<p>“… anxious to preserve the possibility of a peaceful solution and had been </p>
<p>distressed by the failure of the Security Council to find a formula around which the </p>
<p>Council could group without vetoes.</p>
<p>“I was asking all Council members without exception if this was an opportunity we </p>
<p>could take. If there was traction we would be willing to consider dropping OP3 of our </p>

<p>“There was a placeholder in the non-paper for a date – 17 March remained and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>“I suggested a further session the following day to get more considered reactions.”</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that the points made by the representatives of the other </p>
<p>Permanent Members of the Council were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN, said that </p>
<p>“Russia had not changed its position: they could not accept automaticity </p>
<p>or ultimata” and the “10-day deadline was too short”. He “questioned how </p>
<p>the UK’s tasks” related to the “key remaining disarmament tasks and the </p>
<p>work programme” required by resolution 1284 which would be issued the </p>
<p>following week.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ambassador Negroponte “said it was clear the UK was going the extra mile </p>
<p>to find a basis for an agreed approach. The proposal should be seriously </p>
<p>considered especially if it strengthened the prospects for Council unity.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Wang Yingfan, Chinese Permanent Representative to the UN, “felt confused”. </p>
<p>Would the UK approach “wipe the slate – and material breach – clean for Iraq?” </p>
<p>He “doubted the timeline was feasible”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Jean-Marc de La Sablière, French Permanent Representative to the </p>
<p>UN, “said France had always been interested in an approach based on </p>
<p>benchmarks – but this had to be in the context of the work programme and </p>
<p>key remaining tasks” required by resolution 1284. “Benchmarks also had </p>
<p>to be completely separate from any ultimatum.” He “thought we could have </p>
<p>disarmament in a limited time without inspections” but “the UK approach did </p>
<p>not allow” Council unity to be preserved.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Points raised by the representatives of other members of the Council included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Gunter Pleuger, German Permanent Representative to the UN, “pleaded for </p>
<p>time to discuss the proposal in detail”, and asked about the status of the paper, </p>
<p>what would be the purpose of the draft resolution without OP3 and whether it </p>
<p>“made sense to set some tasks now when the 1284 key remaining tasks would </p>
<p>be issued soon and subsume them”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Aguilar Zinser, Mexican Permanent Representative to the UN, was </p>
<p>“effusive” about the initiative. He said that the Council “would have to devote </p>
<p>time to studying the proposal”. He questioned the “relationship with the 1284 </p>
<p>tasks; the timeframe … proposed; the role of UNMOVIC and IAEA in verifying </p>
<p>compliance; whether the tests would be collectively assessed; the connection </p>
<p>with the resolution; and whether the use of force would be conditioned”. He had </p>
<p>been asked to set out his Government’s reservations. “They still did not see a </p>
<p>way out of the difficulties in the Council nor elements allowing consensus and </p>
<p>understanding. They still did not have a final position on the draft resolution.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Mamady Traoré, Guinean Permanent Representative to the UN and </p>
<p>President of the Council, was “happy” that the UK “had made this attempt to </p>
<p>reach consensus”.</p>

<p>465</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Mikhail Wehbe, Syrian Permanent Representative to the UN, said the UK’s </p>
<p>“non-paper made matters even worse as it included warnings over and above </p>
<p>those in 1441 as well as multiple ultimata”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Stefan Tafrov, Bulgarian Permanent Representative to the UN, “felt this was </p>
<p>a genuine effort at consensus that would need some time to digest”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Martin Belinga Eboutou, Cameroonian Permanent Representative to the UN, </p>
<p>“thought this might open a path to bringing forward the different viewpoints”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Munir Akram, Pakistani Permanent Representative to the UN, asked “a host </p>
<p>of questions” and said “he had always envisaged a ‘credibility test’ that would </p>
<p>show peaceful disarmament was possible”; but Pakistan had seen that as the </p>
<p>“first instalment and as deriving from the 1284 key tasks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Ismael Gaspar Martins, Angolan Permanent Representative to the UN, </p>
<p>“saw value in the paper and liked the idea of disarmament in instalments”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Juan Gabriel Valdés, Chilean Permanent Representative to the UN, </p>
<p>“welcomed this effort addressing the concerns many had recently expressed”. </p>
<p>He would divulge his country’s views the following day.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Arias said the approach “was a positive way of achieving consensus”. </p>
<p>He “supported the concept and content”.</p>
<p><b>376. </b> Dr Blix said UNMOVIC would be sending its draft of the key tasks required by </p>
<p>resolution 1284 to the College of Commissioners that evening for comment by 14 March. </p>
<p>The tasks would be ready the following week. It was for the Council to decide whether </p>
<p>it agreed with the tasks selected.</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had:</p>
<p>“… said there had been recent discussion of how to continue exerting pressure, of </p>
<p>which military pressure was the most important element. There was the concept of </p>
<p>a “strategic decision” by Iraq …</p>
<p>“He understood the UK was asking for a commitment from Iraq along with a down-</p>
<p>payment. While they might not be formulated identically, all the questions raised </p>
<p>by the UK figured in the key remaining disarmament tasks … The statement by </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was none of UNMOVIC’s business while interviews outside Iraq </p>
<p>was an element of the work programme. Progress on missiles could be speeded up.</p>
<p>“How far Iraq would be able to do the rest, he did not know. UNMOVIC’s judgement </p>
<p>was that these tasks were doable. This was not possible in two days. As for 10 days, </p>
<p>he did not think he could guarantee Iraq would do it but UNMOVIC would report on </p>
<p>what had been done in the time set by the Council but not offering a judgement.</p>
<p>“As we reached the end of the period, there might be another batch of </p>
<p>tests so to continue and renew the pressure on Iraq to deliver the fastest </p>
<p>disarmament possible.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>466</p>
<p><b>378. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that the Council “had to be clear that the ship of the Security </p>
<p>Council was heading for an iceberg”. The UK’s proposal:</p>
<p>“… was a repair job … The whole point was to avoid military action. We could not </p>
<p>go blindly on with 1284 without the crucial missing ingredient – Iraq’s full and </p>
<p>willing co-operation.”</p>
<p><b>379. </b> Addressing specific questions that had been raised, the points made by </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The UK would take yes for an answer if the tests were completed in their </p>
<p>totality. The tests were not impossible and would make it blindingly obvious if </p>
<p>Iraq had taken a strategic decision to disarm …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[W]e might not have to vote as early as 14 March if there was traction … If there </p>
<p>was no traction we would likely vote on 14 March on the current text.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The co-sponsors … had agreed on the package and wanted to see the </p>
<p>Council’s response.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[T]he more people who joined us the more the judgement of compliance would </p>
<p>be a collective one. We valued the judgement of the inspectors, but it was for </p>
<p>the members who signed up to the statement … to assess whether the tests </p>
<p>had been satisfied. 1441 did not specify who would make the judgement on </p>
<p>compliance – that was one of its ambiguities – but if the tests were collective, </p>
<p>the UK had no problem with the judgement being collective”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[W]ithout OP3 our resolution would not be an ultimatum …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[I]f there was traction on this idea, the UK would be committed to getting </p>
<p>maximum time. But it was not possible at this stage to give a firm date and the </p>
<p>flexibility for extra time was very limited …”</p>
<p><b>380. </b> France, Germany and Russia had all responded that the draft resolution, “even </p>
<p>without OP3”, would still authorise force. Sir Jeremy replied that:</p>
<p>“… without OP3, the resolution would be a restatement of resolution 1441 … </p>
<p>There was no way out of the dilemma … unless we delivered Iraqi co-operation. </p>
<p>We were trying to offer a means of doing that. We had to rally, not to camp on </p>
<p>national positions.”</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Sir Jeremy commented that the initiative had resulted in:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>genuine expressions of warmth from the U-6 for taking them seriously;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognition that the UK had made a real effort to find a way through for </p>
<p>the Council;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>discomfiture of the negative forces, who sounded plaintive and inflexible in </p>
<p>their questioning;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reasonable support from Blix, who did more than not disown us (though he </p>
<p>could have been more helpful on the timeline); and</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>finally, a bit of time. I can keep this going at least until the weekend.”</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK had not achieved “any kind of breakthrough. The French, Germans </p>
<p>and Russians will undoubtedly home in on the preambular section of the draft </p>
<p>resolution and on the whiff of ultimatum in the side statement”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there were “serious questions about the available time”, which the US would </p>
<p>“not help us to satisfy”.</p>
<p><b>382. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that informal consultations would resume the following </p>
<p>afternoon. He did “not think he needed detailed instructions if we continue down this </p>
<p>track for a further day or two, but grateful for comments and telling arguments on where </p>
<p>we have reached so far”.</p>
<p>FRENCH CONCERNS ABOUT THE UK PRESENTATION OF PRESIDENT CHIRAC’S </p>
<p>REMARKS</p>
<p><b>383.  France registered its concerns about the way in which the UK Government </b></p>
<p><b>was describing President Chirac’s comment about a veto.</b></p>
<p><b>384. </b> In addition to his conversation with Mr Rycroft that morning (described earlier in </p>
<p>this Section), Mr Errera called on Mr Ricketts on the evening of 12 March for “a private </p>
<p>talk on where things stood” between the UK and France on Iraq.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Ricketts reported to Sir John Holmes that Mr Errera had remonstrated “about </p>
<p>how British Ministers had misconstrued President Chirac’s comments”, and that he </p>
<p>[Ricketts] had responded by pointing out the prominence of the quote on the front page </p>
<p>of <i>Le Monde</i>. He and Mr Errera had:</p>
<p>“… agreed fairly quickly that the immediate crisis would play out with France and the </p>
<p>UK on different positions, and that the more productive thing was to look ahead, and </p>
<p>consider what lessons we should learn from recent events …”</p>
<p><b>386. </b> Mr Errera had assumed “that the UK would not want to go through again what we </p>
<p>had been put through in recent weeks by the Americans”; “nor would it be so easy for </p>
<p>the UK to claim that our policy of close alliance gave us real traction over US policy”.</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Mr Ricketts responded that Iraq had shown up:</p>
<p>“… very starkly a difference of threat perception, with the UK, Spain, Italy and some </p>
<p>others … genuinely believing that the threat of WMD in the hands of a regime like </p>
<p>Iraq, in a world inhabited by the likes of Al Qaida, was a worse prospect than the </p>
<p>risks of military action to deal with it … Ministers were genuinely convinced of the </p>
<p>rightness of the policy, it was not poodleism …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>468</p>
<p><b>388. </b> In response to Mr Ricketts’ attempt to focus on issues after the conflict and wider </p>
<p>US/European relations, Mr Errera stated that “the Americans were determined to divide </p>
<p>and rule”; and that they expected “unquestioning support for whatever was their policy </p>
<p>objective of the moment”.</p>
<p><b>389. </b> Mr Ricketts “disputed the model”, commenting that “a bit more modesty” in </p>
<p>European ambitions for a common foreign and security policy “might not be a bad thing”. </p>
<p>Mr Errera “did not have any new thoughts on how a different transatlantic relationship </p>
<p>could be constructed in the light of Iraq beyond the need to strengthen Europe”.</p>
<p><b>390. </b> Mr Ricketts concluded that Mr Errera was “keen to keep channels open despite </p>
<p>the difficulties”; and that he had given the same message.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> A copy of the letter from Mr Ricketts was sent to Sir David Manning.</p>
<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 12 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>392.  The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) continued to warn in March that the </b></p>
<p><b>threat from Al Qaida would increase at the onset of military action against Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>393.  The JIC also warned that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Al Qaida activity in northern Iraq continued; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Al Qaida might have established sleeper cells in Baghdad, to be activated </b></p>
<p><b>during a US occupation.</b></p>
<p><b>394. </b> On 12 March, the JIC produced a further update on the implications for </p>
<p>international terrorism of military action in Iraq.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>395. </b> In its Key Judgements, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat from Al Qaida will increase at the onset of military action against Iraq. </p>
<p>Attack plans in the time-frame of a potential conflict are probably now going </p>
<p>ahead under the control of lower-level operational leaders, but Khalid Sheikh </p>
<p>Muhammad’s capture may lead to postponement or abandonment of at least </p>
<p>some terrorist plans.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The greatest threat to Western interests from Islamist terrorists is in the Middle </p>
<p>East. South-East Asia and East Africa are the most likely regions for attack </p>
<p>outside the Middle East, although Al Qaida retains a strong determination to </p>
<p>mount attacks in the US and UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida and sympathisers may well attempt chemical or biological terrorist </p>
<p>attacks in the Gulf, including against UK civilian targets there, in the event of </p>
<p>war with Iraq.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida terrorists in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone (KAZ) previously noted </p>
<p>testing and producing chemical and biological substances remain active and </p>
<p>are likely to attack Coalition forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Senior Al Qaida associated terrorists may have established sleeper cells in Iraq, </p>
<p>to be activated during a Coalition occupation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continues to prepare for terrorist attacks against Western interests in the </p>
<p>Middle East, Europe, South-East Asia and elsewhere, although the regime’s </p>
<p>capability remains limited, especially beyond the Middle East.”</p>
<p><b>396. </b> Other key elements from the Assessment are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 12 March 2003: </b></p>
<p><b>‘International Terrorism: War with Iraq: Update’</b></p>
<p><b>Islamist terrorists</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “a substantial body of reporting of plans by Al Qaida and other Islamist </p>
<p>terrorists for attacks in the Middle East”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Arrests of extremists involved in chemical/biological (CB) attack plans in Bahrain </p>
<p>may have reduced the threat of an attack there linked to conflict with Iraq. But the </p>
<p>full distribution of instructions for making CB devices has yet to be uncovered […]”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A substantial body of reporting (much of which is also uncorroborated) suggests </p>
<p>targeting against UK and US interests.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida retained “a strong determination to mount attacks in both countries”.</p>
<p><b>Islamist terrorists in Iraq</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reporting since 10 February had suggested that the senior Al Qaida associate, </p>
<p>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, had “established sleeper cells in Baghdad, to be activated </p>
<p>during a US occupation of the city”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “possible” that the sleeper cells had “received CB materials from terrorists </p>
<p>in the KAZ”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Whatever the precise relationship between al-Zarqawi and his DGI [Directorate of </p>
<p>General Intelligence] contacts”, it was “unlikely that he could conduct activities in </p>
<p>Iraq without the knowledge (and probably the support) of the regime”.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Despite serious setbacks for Al Qaida, and some disruption of terrorist activity, </p>
<p>especially in the Middle East, the threat from Islamist terrorism in the event of </p>
<p>war with Iraq remains high, with continuing evidence of attack planning. We can </p>
<p>expect Al Qaida to persist with plans for at least one major attack to coincide with </p>
<p>an outbreak of hostilities, as well as widespread attempts at low-level attacks by </p>
<p>extremist groups and individuals worldwide, especially in the Middle East, Africa </p>
<p>and South-East Asia.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that the threat from Al Qaida remained “greater than any terrorist </p>
<p>threat from Iraq”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>Events of 13 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>397.  Mr Blair saw both Mr Cook and Ms Short before Cabinet on 13 March to </b></p>
<p><b>discuss their concerns.</b></p>
<p><b>398. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that, in the context of preparations for meetings </p>
<p>with Mr Cook and Ms Short:</p>
<p>“JP [John Prescott] emphasised how important it was to make clear today was </p>
<p>not the final Cabinet before any action, that there would be another one if the UN </p>
<p>process collapsed. The political argument that we needed now was that the French </p>
<p>had made it more not less likely that there would be conflict. This was the way some </p>
<p>of our MPs could come back … Jack [Straw] agreed to go out and do clips [for the </p>
<p>media] on the French.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Mr Cook wrote in his memoir that he told Mr Blair before Cabinet on 13 March that </p>
<p>his mind was made up (to resign if the UK went ahead without a second resolution), but </p>
<p>he would not make a public move while Blair was “still working for a result at the UN”.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Mr Cook wrote that his impression was that Mr Blair was “mystified as to quite how </p>
<p>he had got into such a hole and baffled as to whether there was any way out other than </p>
<p>persisting in the strategy that has created his present difficulties”.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> In relation to press reports that Mr Blair had told Mr Duncan Smith that he now </p>
<p>thought a second resolution “very unlikely”, Mr Cook also wrote:</p>
<p>“Since the fiction that Tony still hopes to get a second resolution is central to his </p>
<p>strategy for keeping the Labour Party in check, it is not welcome news that IDS has </p>
<p>told the world that not even Tony believes this.”</p>
<p><b>402. </b> Following Ms Short’s interview with the <i>BBC</i>’s<i> Westminster Hour</i> on 9 March, </p>
<p>Mr Chakrabarti had written to Sir Andrew Turnbull on 11 March to explain Ms Short’s </p>
<p>position.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Chakrabarti described Ms Short’s concerns as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The process of trying to obtain the second resolution “prior to military action </p>
<p>should be fair and transparent”. “That would include no undue pressure on the </p>
<p>smaller SC members; allowing enough time (perhaps until the end of March) </p>
<p>after voting on a new resolution for the process of an ultimatum to run its course; </p>
<p>an objective judgment about whether Iraq had complied with any ultimatum </p>

<p>(which the proposed tests would help with); and a clear legal opinion about the </p>
<p>circumstances under which military action without a further resolution could meet </p>
<p>the UK Government’s commitment to respect international law.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Early and public agreement with the USA on a UN SC mandate for the civil </p>
<p>administration and reconstruction of Iraq”, which would “almost certainly require” </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s personal involvement with President Bush. DFID understood that </p>
<p>“it would be illegal for us, the UN and many other donors to get involved in the </p>
<p>reform of Iraqi institutions and reconstruction of the country (beyond what is </p>
<p>needed for the delivery of immediate humanitarian assistance under our Hague </p>
<p>and Geneva Convention obligations) without a further … UNSC mandate. </p>
<p>The absence of agreement with the US on this is holding up international </p>
<p>planning and the prospects of burden sharing.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “highly desirable” for Mr Blair to meet Mr Annan “soon and more </p>
<p>often”. That “would send a clearer signal of the certainty we attach to the </p>
<p>UN role”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Quartet Road Map “should be published before any military action”. </p>
<p>Ms Short felt “strongly that now is the time” for Mr Blair to get President Bush </p>
<p>to “sign up” to publication. Progress would “reduce the hostility to the West and </p>
<p>tensions in the Arab world which our actions in Iraq risk provoking”.</p>
<p><b>404. </b> In relation to the need for a legal opinion, Mr Chakrabarti added:</p>
<p>“I know DFID is not alone in wanting to see written advice from the Attorney General </p>
<p>and/or Ministerial discussion about the legality of military action without the second </p>
<p>UNSCR. It would be strongly desirable for the legal opinion, to cover the range of </p>
<p>possible voting outcomes, to be put to Ministers before the end of the week. If that </p>
<p>legal opinion gave backing to US/UK military intervention in the absence of a second </p>
<p>resolution, Clare believes the Government would still need a discussion on the </p>
<p>political merits of taking that course of action.”</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Chakrabarti suggested that the Government’s communications strategy might </p>
<p>“make clearer the UK’s concerns for the Iraqi people and the centrality of the UN in </p>
<p>resolving the crisis, including through a strong role for the UN after any conflict”.</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Mr Chakrabarti also suggested that “more frequent and systematic discussion of </p>
<p>these issues between senior ministers would be helpful”. He understood that Mr Blair </p>
<p>might ask senior ministers to meet more regularly if conflict started, but advised starting </p>
<p>sooner, “given the scale and significance of the decisions being taken”. In addition, </p>
<p>Mr Blair and Ms Short needed “to talk more often, probably on a daily basis until </p>
<p>negotiations on the second resolution are concluded”. “Most of her concerns” were </p>
<p>“agreed government policy”, but she needed to be reassured that they would be “taken </p>
<p>fully into account”.</p>

<p>Mr Chakrabarti and senior officials had “obviously been instructed by No.10 to try to </p>
<p>get me in line”.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> They had also “been asked to find out what it would take to make </p>
<p>me stay”. After discussion, they agreed that the conditions were:</p>
<p>“1. </p>
<p>Publish Road Map [for the Middle East]</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>Absolute requirement UN mandate for reconstruction</p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>UN mandate for military action.”</p>
<p><b>408. </b> Ms Short added that her diary also recorded:</p>
<p>“Briefing from No.10 I had not raised these issues before. Shocking! Raised at every </p>
<p>Cabinet and at a series of private meetings with TB.”</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Blair told Ms Short that President Bush had “promised a UN mandate for </p>
<p>reconstruction” and that her position on the Road Map might help him with President </p>
<p>Bush. In response to a request from Ms Short that he should “try a process at UN </p>
<p>that treats UN with respect not just forcing US timelines”, Mr Blair “said he could get </p>
<p>more time”.</p>
<p>CABINET, 13 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>410.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 13 March that work continued in the UN to obtain </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution and, following the French decision to veto, the outcome </b></p>
<p><b>remained open.</b></p>
<p><b>411.  Mr Blair indicated that difficult decisions might be required and promised </b></p>
<p><b>a further meeting at which Lord Goldsmith would be present.</b></p>
<p><b>412.  Mr Straw told Cabinet that Iraq continued to be in material breach of </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441 and set out his view of the legal position.</b></p>
<p><b>413.  Mr Straw told Cabinet that there was “good progress” in gaining support in </b></p>
<p><b>the Security Council and described President Chirac’s position as “irresponsible”.</b></p>
<p><b>414.  The position presented to Cabinet by Mr Blair and Mr Straw did not </b></p>
<p><b>acknowledge the reservations expressed by the non-permanent members of the </b></p>
<p><b>Council. The limited time available for a decision, dictated by US decisions on </b></p>
<p><b>the military timetable, meant that it would be very difficult to secure nine votes </b></p>
<p><b>in support of the UK proposals.</b></p>
<p><b>415.  Nor did Mr Blair and Mr Straw acknowledge the concern that, if there were </b></p>

<p><b>416.  Cabinet was not informed of the strategy Mr Blair had agreed with President </b></p>
<p><b>Bush to manage the issue until 17 March.</b></p>
<p><b>417.  There was no discussion of the options available to the UK if the attempt to </b></p>
<p><b>secure a second resolution failed.</b></p>
<p><b>418.  Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Ms Short, whose </b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities were directly engaged, had not seen Lord Goldsmith’s legal </b></p>
<p><b>advice of 7 March.</b></p>
<p><b>419. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 13 March that work continued in the UN to obtain a second </p>
<p>resolution.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> The UK had presented proposals for six “tests”, “endorsed by Dr Blix”, </p>
<p>to judge whether Saddam Hussein had decided to commit himself to disarmament. </p>
<p>Satisfying those tests would not mean that disarmament was complete, but that the </p>
<p>first steps had been taken. The non-permanent members of the Security Council </p>
<p>were uncomfortable with a situation where “following the French decision to veto”, the </p>
<p>Permanent Members were “not shouldering their responsibilities properly”. The “outcome </p>
<p>in the Security Council remained open”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the United Nations process broke down, </p>
<p>difficult decisions would be required and there would be another Cabinet meeting at </p>
<p>which the Attorney General would be present.</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Mr Blair also stated that the MEPP needed to be “revived”; and that “the </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq after a conflict would need a United Nations Security Council </p>
<p>resolution”. The US had “now agreed” to that, which would “help to bring countries with </p>
<p>divergent views on military action back together again”.</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Straw said that although there were differences between members of the </p>
<p>Security Council, “none was saying that Iraq was complying with its international </p>
<p>obligations”; and that it “followed that Iraq continued to be in material breach” of </p>
<p>those obligations.</p>
<p><b>422. </b> On the legal basis for military action, Mr Straw said that he “was already on </p>
<p>record setting out the position to the Foreign Affairs Committee” on 4 March. Mr Straw </p>
<p>rehearsed the negotiating history of resolution 1441 (2002), stating that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the French and Russians had wanted a definition of what would constitute </p>
<p>a material breach, but had settled for the facts being presented to the </p>
<p>Security Council”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“they had also wanted a statement that explicit authorisation was required for </p>
<p>military action and instead had settled for further consideration by the Security </p>
<p>Council …”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure by Iraq to comply with resolution 1441 “revived the authorisations </p>
<p>existing” in resolutions 678 (1990) and 687 (1991).</p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 13 March 2003.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Straw noted that the Government’s supporters had “a clear preference” for a </p>
<p>second resolution but that “had not been seen as an absolute necessity”. There had </p>
<p>been “good progress” in New York in “gaining the support of uncertain non-permanent </p>
<p>members of the Security Council, including Mexico and Chile”.</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Mr Straw described Mr Chirac’s public assertion that “France would veto in any </p>
<p>circumstances” as “utterly irresponsible”; and that Mr Annan was “equally unhappy” </p>
<p>with that development.</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Mr Straw’s sense was that there was “growing understanding for the Government’s </p>
<p>case” in the House of Commons.</p>
<p><b>426. </b> In the discussion, the points made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the integrity of the UN process should be respected and enough time allowed for </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to meet the tests;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the French veto was significant because “it implied that France would never be </p>
<p>prepared to use force”; its approach “amounted to dismissing the evidence and </p>
<p>insisting on indefinite delay”. The French position had “undermined the unity” </p>
<p>of the Security Council;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a majority of the members of the European Union supported the UK line;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “balance had to be struck between striving” for a second resolution and “being </p>
<p>prepared to do without it if that was the outcome of negotiations”. It would be </p>
<p>“easier” to make the “political, moral and legal case” if such a resolution could </p>
<p>be achieved;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>although the rhetoric used by the US leadership was “sometimes unpopular”, </p>
<p>that “did not mean that their policy was wrong”. President Bush had made more </p>
<p>use of the UN than his predecessor and he had publicly committed the US to </p>
<p>a two-state solution in the Middle East;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “atmosphere in the Middle East and more generally would be transformed </p>
<p>for the better” if the United States could be persuaded to publish the Road Map </p>
<p>for the MEPP; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN authority for the reconstruction of Iraq was “essential so that all countries </p>
<p>and international institutions could contribute”.</p>
<p><b>427. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that there had been welcome progress </p>
<p>in the Middle East with the appointment of a Palestinian Prime Minister. That called for </p>
<p>a positive response by the US. The French position “looked to be based on a calculation </p>
<p>of strategic benefit”. It was “in contradiction of the Security Council’s earlier view that </p>
<p>military action would follow if Iraq did not fully and unconditionally co-operate with the </p>
<p>inspectors”. The UK would “continue to show flexibility” in its efforts to achieve a second </p>
<p>resolution and, “if France could be shown to be intransigent, the mood of the Security </p>
<p>Council could change towards support for the British draft”.</p>

<p><b>428. </b> Cabinet: “Took note.”</p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Cook wrote in his memoir:</p>
<p>“When we began, Gordon launched a long and passionate statement of support </p>
<p>for Tony’s strategy. The contribution was rather marred by an outspoken attack </p>
<p>on France: ‘the message that must go out from this Cabinet is that we pin the </p>
<p>blame on France for its isolated refusal to agree in the Security Council’.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Cook added that he had reminded colleagues that “when this is over, the first </p>
<p>priority must be to repair the divisions in Europe” and that the Government should </p>
<p>not make that job more difficult by sending out messages that attack France or any </p>
<p>other European country”. He had “applauded” the “ingenuity” of Mr Blair, Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock in finding new initiatives but stated that “the intensity of our </p>
<p>efforts to get agreement in the Security Council means that we cannot now pretend </p>
<p>that it does not really matter if we fail to get agreement”. Mr Cook had warned that the </p>
<p>Government “should avoid saying that we will take military action even if we fail to get </p>
<p>a resolution, as we need some flexibility to consider what we do if we find ourselves </p>
<p>in that position”.</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Ms Short wrote that she had asked for “a special Cabinet with the Attorney General </p>
<p>present” and that had been agreed.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> She had also said, “if we have UN mandate, </p>
<p>possible progress on Palestine /Israel and try with the second resolution process, it </p>
<p>would make a big difference”. She was “hopeful of progress”.</p>
<p><b>432. </b> Ms Short added:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“GB spoke animatedly about what France was saying – no to everything.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Jack Straw also anti-France.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“David Blunkett [the Home Secretary] said we must stand by the PM and Chirac </p>
<p>was reckless …”</p>
<p><b>433. </b> Ms Short had been advised by Mr Chakrabarti that she should focus her </p>
<p>intervention in Cabinet on the need for “a proper decision making process”, which would </p>
<p>be “important both in substance and … for the politics”. In his view, there were two key </p>
<p>points to make:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Cabinet needs to discuss now the legal opinion of the Attorney General and </p>
<p>how to make it public. This is vital for Ministers, our armed services and the </p>
<p>civil service.”</p>

<p>“As soon as we are clear on the second resolution (whether it fails to get </p>

<p>for a discussion on the politics and to put a proposition to Parliament for </p>
<p>immediate debate.”</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>434. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Williams of Mostyn, the Leader of the House of Lords and Attorney General </p>
<p>from 1999 to 2001, had “said there would be a debate [in Cabinet] on the </p>
<p>legality”, and Ms Short had said Lord Goldsmith should be present. Mr Blair had </p>
<p>“said of course he would”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair “said that the French had exposed fully how intransigent they were. </p>
<p>Chirac’s ‘whatever the circumstances’ was a mistake, and the wrong approach, </p>
<p>and people were angry about it. They had also now rejected the basis of the </p>
<p>tests we were proposing without any discussion or consideration. He felt </p>
<p>Chirac’s desire for a ‘bipolar world’ was leading him to turn away from discussion </p>
<p>of any kind on this. He promised another discussion before a vote.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Brown “came in very strongly later on, on the French in particular”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Cook “said we should not ‘burn our bridges’ with the French, made clear </p>
<p>that there must be a legal base for action, there was no political case without </p>
<p>a second resolution and we must keep working for it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Short “said we needed the Road Map published, lambasted the ‘megaphone </p>
<p>diplomacy’ but as ever gave the impression that it was just us and the Americans </p>
<p>who engaged in it. She said the world community was split because the </p>
<p>Americans were rushing. We should not be attacking the French but coming up </p>
<p>with a different kind of process. ‘If we can get the Road Map, we can get the </p>
<p>world reunited behind it.’”</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>435. </b> Mr Campbell commented that Mr Cook had spoken “very deliberately” and his </p>
<p>intervention was “a very clear marker” that he would resign “if there was action without a </p>
<p>second resolution. He felt we did not have the moral, diplomatic or humanitarian cover.”</p>
<p><b>436. </b> Ms Short told the Inquiry that the “strategy was: blame the French and claim that </p>
<p>they’d said they would veto anything. And they said it at the Cabinet …”</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>437. </b> Sir Stephen Wall, Mr Blair’s Adviser on European Issues and Head of the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office European Secretariat 2000 to 2004, told the Inquiry that at Cabinet on 13 March:</p>
<p>“As Tony Blair came into the room John Prescott stood up and saluted. It was a </p>
<p>sort of funny moment but in I think in a rather characteristic way John Prescott was </p>
<p>doing something quite clever. He was saying ‘You are the Commander in Chief and </p>

<p>changed. Sitting at the back I had thought to myself ‘This is going to be a difficult </p>
<p>Cabinet’, and it wasn’t.”</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>438. </b> Asked by the Inquiry why he had decided to continue the negotiations and whether </p>
<p>that was “not in particularly good faith”, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“No. It was very simply this, that obviously this was a second best thing now … but </p>
<p>what we decided was … even if you can’t get the resolution because they have </p>
<p>said they will veto, nonetheless you would have some greater, if you like, political </p>
<p>authority if you could at least get a majority of members of the Security Council to </p>
<p>say they would agree such a resolution even vetoed.”</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Asked whether a vetoed resolution would have undermined the authority for </p>
<p>military action in resolution 1441, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“No, it would not have undermined that because we were saying that we accept </p>
<p>that we believed we had authority in 1441, but it would have allowed us politically to </p>
<p>say we had the majority of the Security Council. So had we ended up in a situation </p>
<p>where Chile and Mexico had said ‘We are with you’. We would probably have put </p>
<p>this resolution down, had it vetoed.”</p>

<p>FRANCE’S POSITION</p>
<p><b>440.  In a statement on 13 March, Mr de Villepin rejected the UK’s tests.</b></p>
<p><b>441. </b> In a statement issued on 13 March, Mr de Villepin said that the UK proposals </p>
<p>did “not address the issues raised by the international community”.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> The aim was </p>
<p>“not to grant Iraq a few extra days before embarking on a path leading to the use of </p>
<p>force, but to move resolutely forward on the peaceful disarmament route”. Inspections </p>
<p>were “a credible alternative to war” and were “producing results” as Dr Blix and </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei had “pointed out in the 7 March report”. In the “spirit” of resolution 1441, </p>
<p>France wanted “a realistic timeframe in which to achieve effective disarmament”. </p>
<p>Success would “demand” Iraq’s “full and wholehearted co-operation”.</p>
<p><b>442. </b> In subsequent interviews for French media, Mr de Villepin stated that the UK </p>
<p>proposal embraced “the idea of an ultimatum, of the automaticity of the recourse </p>
<p>to force” which for France “was unacceptable”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> He pointed out that the US had </p>
<p>“a determining role” as it was “maintaining that the die is cast” and was “intent on </p>
<p>moving towards a military intervention”.</p>

<p>478</p>
<p><b>443.  Mr Straw characterised France’s position as “extraordinary”.</b></p>
<p><b>444. </b> In remarks to the press in Downing Street, Mr Straw said that he found it </p>
<p>“extraordinary” that France had rejected the UK’s proposals “without even proper </p>
<p>consideration”.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> That made a peaceful resolution of the crisis “more difficult”.</p>
<p><b>445. </b> On 13 March, Sir David Manning asked Mr Rycroft for the full text of President </p>
<p>Chirac’s remarks of 10 March, which was circulated within No.10.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>446.  President Chirac’s Diplomatic Adviser, Mr Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, </b></p>
<p><b>complained about the UK Government’s “increasingly polemical approach”, its </b></p>
<p><b>interpretation of President Chirac’s remarks out of context, and the difficulties </b></p>
<p><b>with the UK tests.</b></p>
<p><b>447.  Sir John Holmes robustly defended the UK position.</b></p>
<p><b>448. </b> Mr Gourdault-Montagne telephoned Sir John Holmes at lunch time on 13 March </p>
<p>“to complain about the increasingly polemical approach” the UK was taking.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p><b>449. </b> Mr Gourdault-Montagne stated that the UK approach “ran counter to the </p>
<p>understanding hitherto that we should try to minimise the bilateral fall-out and avoid </p>
<p>mutual or personalised criticism”. France was “particularly upset by our repeated taking </p>
<p>out of context … the President’s remarks on the veto in all circumstances”. The UK </p>
<p>“must be well aware that he had been talking about the particular circumstances that </p>
<p>evening … It was not reasonable to distort what he had said in this way.” Mr Straw’s </p>
<p>reaction to Mr de Villepin’s statement “had also seemed excessively sharp”.</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Sir John Holmes reported that he had responded that France:</p>
<p>“… could hardly be surprised if it became harder to avoid criticism of the French </p>
<p>position when they had spelled out their intention to veto the draft of their allies, </p>
<p>apparently whatever it said. The French were doing everything they could to block </p>
<p>us, not least in our attempt to give a last chance to Saddam to disarm peacefully and </p>
<p>to achieve the second resolution which would reunite the international community </p>
<p>and make international participation in the next stage easier. Villepin’s statement … </p>
<p>this morning attacking our proposals had been particularly hard to take.”</p>
<p><b>451. </b> Sir John stated that the UK “conditions” were taken from the UNMOVIC report </p>
<p>and “were precisely the questions which needed answering if we were to conclude that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had taken a strategic decision to disarm”.</p>
<p><b>452. </b> Mr Gourdault-Montagne responded by saying that the requirement that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein should appear on TV to apologise was “a nonsense”. The UK “knew the Arab </p>

<p>world better than that”; and the UK was “still on the line of an ultimatum with an absurdly </p>
<p>short deadline”. France’s position had been “consistent and coherent throughout”, and it </p>
<p>had “warned” the UK “not to underestimate” its “determination to carry this position to its </p>
<p>logical conclusion”.</p>
<p><b>453. </b> Sir John stated that he “respected the French right to have a different position, but </p>
<p>there had been no need to go as far as a veto, and a deliberate move to declare it in </p>
<p>advance to try to influence others against our ideas”. He added that:</p>
<p>“France seemed to be forgetting what was in 1441 – Saddam had to make an </p>
<p>immediate and accurate declaration and co-operate fully and immediately … or face </p>
<p>the consequences. He had done neither of these things. We could not simply let </p>
<p>things drift.”</p>
<p><b>454. </b> Mr Gourdault-Montagne replied that “the inspectors had made clear that the </p>
<p>process was working, even if co-operation was not total. In these circumstances, it was </p>
<p>not right to rush to war.” He repeated “in a spirit of friendship” that what the UK was </p>
<p>doing “was against what the French had … thought was agreed between us. The French </p>
<p>had been very careful to avoid any such thing …”</p>
<p><b>455. </b> Sir John concluded that Mr Gourdault-Montagne “should appreciate the extent </p>
<p>to which France had pushed her position against her closest allies was hard to </p>
<p>understand”. The UK “had offered to try to find common ground several times but to </p>
<p>no avail”.</p>
<p><b>456. </b> Sir John also recorded that he had been told by the US Ambassador to France </p>
<p>that “he had seen Mr de Villepin the previous evening to enquire what lay behind </p>
<p>the President’s words on the veto”. Mr de Villepin “had claimed US and French </p>
<p>positions were really quite close, but the problem was the lack of flexibility in the US </p>
<p>stance”. The Ambassador had advised him to speak to Secretary Powell and they had </p>
<p>subsequently “spoken at length” but their “positions were too far apart … on timescale </p>
<p>and automaticity” to reach agreement: “Like us, the Americans judged that Chirac was </p>
<p>not really looking for a way out.”</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Sir John commented that it was:</p>
<p>“Predictable that the French would react in this way. There is a clear danger of an </p>
<p>upward spiral of polemics which could make working together afterwards harder. </p>
<p>But our position can hardly surprise the French, nor the fact that we are using </p>

<p><b>460.  In response to a suggestion that France and the UK should look for a point </b></p>
<p><b>of compromise, Mr Straw replied that “the key decision had to be made in the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council” and “no one on 10 March had said that Saddam Hussein was </b></p>
<p><b>complying with his obligations. He was therefore in further material breach.”</b></p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr de Villepin also telephoned Mr Straw on 13 March. The record stated that he:</p>
<p>“… said France was still willing to consider any new proposals … ready to discuss </p>
<p>any solution based on benchmarks … [and] any timetable, even a reduced one, if </p>
<p>that was ‘satisfactory for you and the US’. His bottom line focused on automaticity. </p>
<p>France could work on any mechanism which contained an ultimatum as long as it </p>
<p>was the Security Council which took full responsibility at the end of any deadline.”</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Straw said that President Chirac’s statement on 10 March that “France would </p>
<p>vote against a second resolution ‘whatever the circumstances’ had caused great </p>
<p>difficulties. It was clear that France would veto.”</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Mr de Villepin responded that President Chirac had “never said that”; he “had not </p>
<p>meant that France would not try to find common ground”; nor “that, whatever happened, </p>
<p>France would vote no”. His comments had been “only in the context of text [of the draft </p>
<p>resolution] on the table” on 10 March.</p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Straw replied that:</p>
<p>“… he had read the comments differently. It had made life very difficult in the US. </p>
<p>They had assumed France would vote no in any circumstances. As a result they </p>
<p>were now falling back on UNSCR 1441. The UK had, however, managed to keep </p>
<p>dialogue going through the weekend. The UK had never said that 1441 contained </p>
<p>automaticity … But the UK did not want Iraq stringing things out. If things went on </p>
<p>too long, the military threat was degraded.”</p>
<p><b>465. </b> In response to a request from Mr de Villepin that they should look for “a point of </p>
<p>compromise” with a meeting of the Security Council following a further report from the </p>
<p>inspectors “perhaps in one month, two months or perhaps just three weeks”, Mr Straw </p>
<p>pointed out:</p>
<p>“The key decision had to be made by the Security Council. The inspectors’ role was </p>
<p>to provide evidence, although others could too. It was clear that Iraq was in material </p>
<p>breach. Though there were many different positions in the Security Council, no one </p>
<p>on 10 March had said that Saddam Hussein was complying with his obligations. </p>
<p>He was therefore in further material breach.”</p>

<p><b>466. </b> Later in the conversation, Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“… briefly described the importance of the UK’s new benchmarks. Unless Iraq </p>
<p>realised it was facing its final, final chance, the international community would not </p>
<p>get Iraq to face reality. Put bluntly, delay played into the hands of those in the US </p>
<p>who said we should not go down the UN route. That said, he was happy to see </p>
<p>new propositions at any time.”</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr de Villepin concluded that “a way forward could be found”. Mr Straw replied </p>
<p>that “there would have to be discussion of these issues at Heads of Government level, </p>
<p>though not in New York”.</p>
<p><b>468. </b> The UK Embassy in Paris reported that Mr de Villepin had followed his rejection </p>
<p>of the UK’s proposals on 13 March with a briefing emphasising France’s wish to find a </p>
<p>solution leading to consensus in the Security Council and referring to his conversation </p>
<p>with Mr Straw.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>469. </b> Asked to confirm that France did not exclude an ultimatum, a senior French </p>
<p>Foreign Ministry official had, however, been “adamant: any ultimatum that did not leave </p>
<p>the final decision to the Security Council constituted a red line … The French were open </p>
<p>to any solution that enabled inspections to continue.” The official had claimed that a </p>
<p>failed attempt to get a second resolution would annul the effects of the first resolution; </p>
<p>the Council would have refused to authorise military intervention and any intervention </p>
<p>would be outside the Charter and “at the limit of aggression”.</p>
<p><b>470. </b> The Embassy concluded that Mr de Villepin’s position was “a tactical move </p>
<p>intended to deflect criticism” of President Chirac’s announcement of a veto “‘whatever </p>

<p>this weekend.”</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the possibility of a meeting in the next </p>

<p> That envisaged </p>
<p>the withdrawal of the resolution on 17 March followed by a speech from President Bush </p>

<p>485</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Lavrov had argued that the resolution was not necessary given that the </p>
<p>inspections were making progress; the side statement was based on an </p>
<p>unproven premise that Iraq had WMD; contained an arbitrary timeframe (shorter </p>
<p>than Blix’s months); and unacceptably left the decision on whether Iraq fulfilled </p>
<p>the tests with the member states. The Council should wait until the inspectors </p>
<p>submitted the list of key tasks the following week.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr de La Sablière had taken a similar position. France had “suspicions” that Iraq </p>
<p>had WMD but it could not hand over weapons that did not exist.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>493. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had “explained again”:</p>
<p>“There had to be a test of Iraqi willingness to comply. I did not think anyone thought </p>
<p>that Iraqi compliance had been immediate, unconditional and active. We therefore </p>
<p>needed a ‘downpayment’ or the contract of inspections could not continue. We </p>
<p>were trying to create an alternative to the ‘serious consequences’ in 1441 … In the </p>
<p>next 24 hours I would wish to discuss with all members of the Council … We had </p>
<p>to maintain the two essential elements of 1441: pressure and the effective use of </p>
<p>inspections. The pendulum had swung too far to inspections only. The intention </p>
<p>of the draft was not to provide authorisation for the use of force. We already had </p>
<p>sufficient authorisation in 1441 and related resolutions provided the conditions in </p>
<p>1441 were met.”</p>
<p><b>494. </b> In subsequent discussion, Sir Jeremy stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “tests were a ‘downpayment’ on whether Iraqi co-operation would be </p>
<p>forthcoming”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>resolution “1441 was deliberately ambiguous on whether the Council or Member </p>
<p>States would judge Iraqi compliance. We would want the inspectors to report on </p>
<p>the facts”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the timeframe had to reflect the realities on the ground and the need for </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>495. </b> In comments to the press after the meeting, Sir Jeremy emphasised the need </p>
<p>for a strong signal of strategic change from Iraq and strict time limits based on </p>
<p>resolution 1441 not resolution 1284.</p>
<p><b>496. </b> In a subsequent telegram, Sir Jeremy commented that the US thought the </p>
<p>benchmark process was “running out of steam”, and that support from London would </p>
<p>be needed. That:</p>
<p>“… might take us through to the end of Friday. But by 15 March (if not before), </p>
<p>I suspect that Washington will be ready to call a halt to the UN process, no doubt </p>
<p>with some strong words about France and Russia.”</p>

<p>‘traction’ on it, he could be flexible on a number of points, even altogether dropping </p>
<p>the draft operative paragraph 3 or, indeed the whole draft resolution, which looked </p>
<p>like an ultimatum. Although this step was presented as a last concession, the </p>
<p>political signal of the benchmark paper standing alone would probably be seen as </p>
<p>an ultimatum. It would be understood that if the declaration was not made and/or </p>
<p>the benchmarks not attained, serious consequences could be expected.”</p>

<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock replied “No”.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Sir Jeremy added that activity had “really stopped after Wednesday [12 March]” </p>

<p>“… By Friday morning there was an eerie silence. Nothing was happening. We were </p>

<p>487</p>
<p><b>502. </b> As the preceding Sections of the Report show:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France and Russia had consistently expressed reservations about US and UK </p>
<p>policy on Iraq and the consequences of military action. In particular, they were </p>
<p>concerned about the use of force without clear evidence that Iraq had weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and without an explicit authorisation by the Security Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Members of the Security Council had differing views of Iraq’s position and </p>
<p>whether or not its actions indicated a strategic decision to co-operate with the </p>
<p>requirements of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>503. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>he had been in no doubt that France and Russia, accompanied consistently </p>
<p>by Germany, would be fighting the UK all the way on the proposed second </p>
<p>resolution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US, the UK, Spain and Bulgaria were a “reasonably solid quartet”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>China and Syria “could not be expected to support the UK”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>much of the resistance in the Security Council to the UK’s arguments revolved </p>
<p>around the question “What is the hurry when the inspectors are just getting down </p>
<p>to business again?”</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Sir Jeremy judged “with hindsight that most members of the Security Council </p>
<p>would have opposed the use of force … on almost any timing unless the inspectors </p>
<p>had succeeded in exposing Iraq’s deception with the discovery of an active chemical </p>
<p>or biological weapon”.</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry, “I never felt that we got close to having nine positive </p>
<p>votes in the bag” and that when he was asked by London how many votes he felt were </p>
<p>sure, he would say four:</p>
<p>“I would never report it back to London that I had more than four sure votes.”</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>506. </b> Sir Jeremy said that President Chirac’s remarks on 10 March:</p>
<p>“… made my life more difficult, because it made the ‘undecided six’, for instance, </p>
<p>believe that we were now going through the motions of something that was not </p>
<p>going to produce a result; therefore why should they do something unpopular </p>
<p>with their public opinions at home in siding with the United States on attacking an </p>
<p>Islamic country like Iraq, or whatever the reasons were domestically, when clearly </p>
<p>the Security Council was not going to reach anything if a Permanent Member had </p>
<p>pre-declared a veto?</p>

<p><b>507. </b> Asked whether President Chirac’s statement was “simply saying what everybody </p>
<p>already knew, and what to a degree had already been said by the French in public”, </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, but saying it at Presidential level very publicly changed the political effect </p>
<p>of the French position on the rest of the Security Council.”</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>508. </b> Sir Jeremy subsequently told the Inquiry that the effect of the statement had </p>
<p>“considerably lessened” the chances of turning the middle-ground six round and </p>
<p>“therefore it was quite an important turning point in the public politics”.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> President </p>
<p>Chirac’s statement had an impact “on the little tiny bit of momentum we still had in </p>
<p>the Security Council with the middle ground”.</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that:</p>
<p>“… we knew we had only a minority chance of achieving a second resolution … but </p>
<p>with the United States in the game pulling out all the stops, you never quite know </p>
<p>when countries opposing them may be pulled into another position.”</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Asked what, at the beginning of the negotiation, he had thought the chances </p>
<p>of success in the second resolution were, Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Less than 50 percent.”</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy added that hindsight discoloured his recollection </p>
<p>but, “in my mind, between a quarter and a third of a chance that we might do this”. </p>
<p>He “wasn’t advising London that we were likely to succeed”.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Asked about his statement that the UK never had more than four firm votes, </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock replied:</p>
<p>“Right at the end. We knew we had four. We were after those six to make it ten, the </p>
<p>middle-ground members. Each of those six at some point during February, as they </p>
<p>were being chased round by Baroness Amos and others, trying to persuade them in </p>
<p>their capitals to follow us, said that they might do it or were going to follow us, and </p>
<p>then backed off when they saw that the others weren’t following. So we were herding </p>
<p>cats unsuccessfully in that respect, and never got all six together to have confidence </p>
<p>in each other’s preparedness to do it.”</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>512. </b> Sir David Manning did not think that the middle-ground six would have supported </p>
<p>action in the timeframe that was under discussion:</p>
<p>“… if there had been more time, I think that the six in the UN – their minds weren’t </p>
<p>necessarily closed … if you had got a different dynamic going in February, March, </p>
<p>April between the leaders on the basis of whatever Blix was saying, and there </p>

<p>seemed to be more common ground, then it was possible that you could have found </p>
<p>some kind of common resolution.”</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>513. </b> Asked whether Ministers had been over-optimistic in tabling the second resolution, </p>
<p>thinking that France and Russia would agree to it, Sir John Holmes told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It was always an optimistic approach to think you would get a second resolution and </p>
<p>you would get nine votes for it, as the struggle to get those votes demonstrated very </p>
<p>clearly in the weeks that followed.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>514. </b> Sir John Holmes stated that France thought the timelines and tests in the draft </p>
<p>resolution were “deliberately impossible” for Saddam Hussein to pass and were “not </p>
<p>a way of actually avoiding war but was simply a way of legitimising it”.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> That was why </p>
<p>it was “so strongly opposed”.</p>
<p><b>515. </b> Asked if there were any circumstances in which France might have supported a </p>
<p>second resolution authorising the use of force, Sir John said that, by that stage, “it would </p>
<p>have taken something pretty dramatic”, such as a find by the inspectors or reckless </p>
<p>behaviour by Saddam Hussein, to change the mind of France.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>516. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that, before President Chirac’s statement of 10 March, </p>
<p>the UK had “got the three African states on board, we thought we had the Chileans </p>
<p>and the Mexicans” although the negotiations were finely balanced.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> The moment </p>
<p>when he did not think it would be possible to achieve a second resolution was when </p>
<p>he had “turned on the television” and seen “President Chirac saying that, whatever the </p>
<p>circumstances, France would veto a second resolution”.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Later, Mr Straw took a more qualified view:</p>
<p>“… our judgement was that we thought that the three African states were highly </p>
<p>likely to support a resolution. The problem was between … Chile and Mexico and </p>
<p>President Fox and President Lagos [each] looking over [his] … shoulder at the </p>
<p>other one. My own view is – not that – in the absence of the Chirac ‘veto’ statement </p>
<p>on 10 March, we would have got their support, but it would have been much </p>
<p>more probable.”</p>
<p>169</p>
<p><b>518. </b> Mr Straw also stated:</p>
<p>“… the great danger, which we felt we faced, was that, if you didn’t bring this to a </p>
<p>conclusion one way or the other quite quickly, then the whole strategy of diplomacy </p>

<p>backed by the threat, and if necessary, the use of force, would fall away and that’s </p>
<p>what Saddam wanted.”</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>519. </b> Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of the FCO UN Department, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I am not sure that the American Administration was ever formally committed to </p>
<p>a second resolution … I think … they were willing to let us have a go at trying … </p>
<p>They certainly did not see a legal necessity for it and they, I think, obviously feared </p>
<p>that it could only result in more complication at the UN Security Council.”</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Asked whether that was his understanding, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“That was, of course, the downside. That it might expose divisions rather than </p>
<p>resolve them. I still with the benefit of hindsight think it was worth attempting the </p>
<p>second resolution. We were elusively close, in my judgement, to getting those magic </p>
<p>nine votes and no veto but it didn’t happen. That was their concern. That said, the </p>
<p>Americans, certainly Secretary Powell, were very assiduous in seeking to build up </p>
<p>support for the second resolution. There are records that you will have seen where </p>
<p>he reports he worked the phones with various people.”</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>521. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that the leaders of the African nations, Chile and </p>
<p>Mexico “would not put their heads above the parapet knowing that France would veto </p>
<p>‘whatever the circumstances’. The resolution was dying.”</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the UK had come “pretty close” to a majority of votes; </p>
<p>and that, “we could have got Chile and Mexico actually if the French position had been </p>
<p>less emphatic”.</p>

<p><b>526.  Mr Blair had “insisted that it must be the Security Council” which decided </b></p>
<p><b>whether Saddam Hussein had co-operated, not the inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>527. </b> President Chirac asked to speak to Mr Blair on 14 March.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>528. </b> Drawing the report of Mr Straw’s conversation with Mr de Villepin on 13 March </p>
<p>to Mr Blair’s attention before the telephone call with President Chirac, Sir David </p>
<p>Manning wrote:</p>
<p>“No surprises: will probably complain we are misrepresenting him; will offer new </p>
<p>effort based on the shorter time line but no automaticity. You can certainly point </p>
<p>to his frenetic efforts to block us at every turn.”</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>529. </b> President Chirac told Mr Blair that France was “content to proceed ‘in the logic of </p>
<p>UNSCR 1441’; but it could not accept an ultimatum or any ‘automaticity’ of recourse to </p>
<p>force”.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> He proposed looking at a new resolution in line with resolution 1441, “provided </p>
<p>that it excluded these options”.</p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Blair “said that we needed clear, specific ‘tests’ to measure whether Saddam </p>
<p>was co-operating”. Of the six tests proposed by the UK, “five were from the Blix ‘clusters’ </p>
<p>report and the sixth had been proposed by the inspectors and was intended to provide </p>
<p>a mechanism for junior Iraqi officials and scientists to co-operate with the inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>531. </b> President Chirac “suggested that the UNMOVIC work programme might provide </p>
<p>a way forward. France was prepared to look at reducing the 120 day timeframe it </p>
<p>envisaged.”</p>
<p><b>532. </b> Mr Blair responded that “still did not get round the problem that if Saddam was </p>
<p>found to be in breach, all the [sic] followed was more discussion and we were back </p>
<p>where we started. It must be clear that … action would ensue.”</p>
<p><b>533. </b> In response to a question from President Chirac about whether it would be the </p>
<p>inspectors or the Security Council who decided whether Saddam had co-operated, </p>
<p>Mr Blair “insisted that it must be the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>534. </b> President Chirac agreed, “although the Security Council should make its </p>
<p>judgement on the basis of the inspectors’ report”. He “wondered whether it would be </p>
<p>worth” Mr Straw and Mr de Villepin “discussing the situation to see if we could find some </p>
<p>flexibility”; or was it “too late”?</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>492</p>
<p><b>536. </b> President Chirac concluded that “talking direct was better than via TV and radio </p>
<p>broadcasts”. He had told Mr Blair that he did not want “disagreements over Iraq to have </p>
<p>an impact on the UK and France’s joint interests in Europe” and they should talk before </p>
<p>the European Council on 20 March.</p>
<p><b>537. </b> Mr Blair “said that he too did not want things to become more difficult”. He “wanted </p>
<p>to ensure the strength of the UK/France relationship was not affected”.</p>
<p><b>538.  Mr Campbell suggested that Mr Straw was “instructed” to “concede nothing” </b></p>
<p><b>when he spoke to Mr de Villepin.</b></p>
<p><b>539. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the discussion was “a lot friendlier than it might have been” </p>
<p>but President Chirac had been:</p>
<p>“… straight on to the point TB expected, namely he could see a way of co-operating </p>
<p>on the tests but it must be the inspectors who decide if Saddam is co-operating. </p>
<p>He said he could not support an ultimatum or anything taken as a support for </p>
<p>military action.</p>
<p>“TB said the problem with that was that it meant he could have as many last </p>
<p>chances and as much time as he [Saddam] wanted. There had to be automaticity </p>
<p>[trigger for attack].</p>
<p>“Chirac said there could not be automaticity.”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>540. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair and President Chirac had agreed Mr Straw </p>
<p>and Mr de Villepin should talk, but Mr Blair “issued instructions” to Mr Straw </p>
<p>“to concede nothing. There was intelligence suggesting the French were seeking </p>
<p>to get the undecided six to go for tests plus more time.” Mr Blair suspected </p>
<p>President Chirac “would move to a position of automaticity but inspectors are the sole </p>
<p>judges of compliance”.</p>
<p><b>541. </b> Asked whether the UK had been told by France that it was misrepresenting </p>
<p>President Chirac’s position, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he had spoken to President </p>
<p>Chirac on 14 March and:</p>
<p>“The French position was very, very clear. It wasn’t that they would veto any </p>
<p>resolution, it is that they would veto a resolution that authorised force in the event </p>
<p>of breach.”</p>

<p><b>545.  In a conversation with President Bush about the French position and what </b></p>
<p><b>to say when the resolution was pulled, Mr Blair proposed that they would need to </b></p>
<p><b>show that France would not authorise the use of force in any circumstances.</b></p>
<p><b>546. </b> When Mr Blair and President Bush spoke on 14 March they discussed the French </p>
<p>position and what to say about the French position when the decision was taken to pull </p>
<p>the resolution.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>547. </b> Mr Blair stated that:</p>
<p>“… we would need to do so as the reasonable party, showing that France would not </p>
<p>authorise the use of force in any circumstances, and demonstrating that we were </p>
<p>sticking to 1441.”</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Mr Blair said that at some point we needed to set out our views on  </p>
<p>post-conflict, including humanitarian issues; a joint statement at the Azores Summit </p>
<p>would be welcome.</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“Bush said he was predicting a ‘landslide, baby!’</p>
<p>“TB said it was too close to call.</p>
<p>“Bush … The Azores was on.</p>
<p>“TB said we had to be seen striving all the way even if we felt the French made </p>

<p>as much time as he wanted.</p>
<p>“Bush said that he did not trust the French but we had to do a slow waltz with them </p>
<p>in the next few days. He felt they thought America was more guilty than Saddam.</p>
<p>“TB said that the French appearing to be so unreasonable had been a big mistake </p>
<p>by Chirac.”</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Asked whether he had agreed with President Bush on 14 March that “the game </p>
<p>was up”, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“The game was up in the sense that we were not going to get a resolution. This </p>
<p>was the second best … Our preference was to have got a resolution that passed </p>
<p>the Security Council … I was very conscious that I had Cabinet members who were </p>
<p>unhappy about this … that it might give us some political weight, I mean not much </p>
<p>frankly, but some if we could say at least we have a majority of members on our </p>
<p>side, even though we knew we were not going to get the resolution.”</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>551. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“It is simply a political point. If you can say, ‘Well we didn’t get the resolution </p>
<p>because France vetoed but nonetheless we got the majority of the Security Council </p>
<p>in our favour,’ it would allow us to say that … It would have helped me. I would have </p>

<p>could be avoided within the next 3-4 days”. He would be holding a press conference </p>
<p>in three hours.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Mr Blair had responded that it was not clear how things would develop. The </p>
<p>Security Council “did not want to vote on a resolution that would be vetoed. Both France </p>
<p>and Russia were very clear that they would not allow a resolution which authorised the </p>
<p>use of force.”</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported at 5.50pm on 14 March that the US, UK and </p>
<p>Spanish Permanent Representatives had met early that morning to discuss how to react </p>
<p>to the new proposal forming amongst the “middle-ground six (U-6)”. They had agreed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the proposal that “the Council would meet at the end of an ultimatum period to </p>
<p>decide on Iraq’s co-operation towards compliance with the tests was completely </p>
<p>unacceptable”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to “major on the primacy of 1441” and tell contacts that “if any of the </p>
<p>U-6 abandoned that baseline, they would do huge damage to the </p>

<p><b>558. </b> President Lagos telephoned No.10 that evening and, in the absence of Mr Blair, </p>

<p><b>559. </b> Mr Rycroft also reported that President Lagos would not push the proposal further </p>

<p><b>560. </b> An unofficial translation of President Lagos’ statement produced by the British </p>
<p>Embassy Santiago reported that it expressed “full understanding of the United States </p>
<p>concern for the threats posed to its security”, which were “also threats to world </p>
<p>security”.</p>

<p> It also stated that Chile continued to make “best efforts to avert war” while </p>
<p>fully supporting the “UN decision aimed at bringing to full and verified compliance the </p>
<p>Iraqi disarmament process” mandated in resolution 1441. President Lagos referred </p>
<p>to “a special co-operative bond”, which Chile had established with the UK.</p>
<p><b>561. </b> The proposal was “for the Security Council to impose … five critical conditions” </p>
<p>derived from the inspection process which should be fulfilled “within a realistic time </p>
<p>period not later than three weeks as from the date on which they are approved by the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>496</p>
<p><b>562. </b> The Chilean proposal omitted the demand for a public statement by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein but repeated the UK proposal for interviews outside Iraq. The remaining tests </p>
<p>were a subset of the UK proposals, requiring Iraq to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disclose any remaining warhead with mustard gas or mustard gas bombs or </p>
<p>any documentation to prove their destruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disclose the 10,000 litres of anthrax or account for its destruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>destroy any Al Samoud 2 missiles and their components; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disclose any information stating that “Remote Control” vehicles do not carry </p>
<p>chemical weapons.</p>
<p><b>563. </b> President Lagos also stated that the “great powers” had “unfortunately failed to </p>
<p>include” the “delicate equilibrium” between “reasonable goals and realistic deadlines” </p>
<p>in their proposed resolutions. Chile would “not concur with a resolution” that failed “to </p>
<p>exhaust all the means available to complete Iraqi disarmament and preserve world </p>
<p>peace”. It was “still possible to reach an understanding and strengthen international </p>
<p>unity”; and that unity would be “the only guarantee of a stable, fair peace”. Chile believed </p>
<p>that Iraqi disarmament could “still be done while preserving and strengthening the </p>
<p>international institutional framework afforded by the United Nations and its Charter, and </p>
<p>seeking any other alternative for the rule of law to prevail over force”.</p>
<p><b>564. </b> Dr Blix wrote that the Chilean proposal replaced the requirement for a televised </p>
<p>speech from Saddam Hussein with a less humiliating letter from the Iraqi leadership and </p>
<p>extended the time given for attainment of the benchmarks to three weeks or 30 days </p>
<p>and for Council collectively to assess if Iraq had attained the benchmarks and to decide </p>
<p>on further action.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> Chile was “not willing to let the Council abdicate this prerogative. </p>
<p>The US on the other hand were not ready to drop the claim of a right to go it alone.”</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK, 14 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>565.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that US pressure on Chile had contributed </b></p>
<p><b>to its decision to stop work on its proposal.</b></p>
<p><b>566.  Sir Jeremy told his colleagues in New York that the UK would continue </b></p>
<p><b>to look for agreement on its proposals. Key decisions would be made at the </b></p>
<p><b>Azores Summit.</b></p>
<p><b>567. </b> Reporting on developments on 14 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that the </p>
<p>U-6 had “made no further efforts to achieve consensus” and their proposal had been </p>
<p>“confirmed dead”.</p>

<p><b>568. </b> Sir Jeremy commented that the process had “ground to a halt” because the text </p>
<p>leaked and the leaked version did not resemble the final draft and because President </p>
<p>Lagos had spoken out too soon, “alerting the US who then put on great pressure to kill </p>
<p>it”. A Chilean official had told the UK Mission that the US pressure on Chile in particular </p>
<p>had been “more … than that put on them to support the UK/US/Spain resolution”.</p>
<p><b>569. </b> When the EU Heads of Mission met to take stock on 14 March, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock told them “discussions were continuing” and he had made clear to the </p>
<p>African and Latin American members of the Council that he was “ready to talk at any </p>
<p>stage. But there remained differences on substance and procedure.” In response to </p>
<p>a comment from the German Ambassador that “both the British and U-6 proposals </p>
<p>were dead in the water”, Sir Jeremy replied that the UK “would keep going”; the Azores </p>
<p>Summit “represented a final opportunity”.</p>
<p><b>570. </b> A scheduled meeting of the P5 was cancelled because there was “little to </p>
<p>talk about”.</p>
<p><b>571. </b> Sir Jeremy also spoke to Dr Blix, and to Mr Annan about “the leading role” he </p>
<p>(Mr Annan) could play in the event of conflict “in healing wounds and reinserting the </p>
<p>UN into the post-conflict situation”.</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“The fact of the Azores Summit, the collapse of the U-6 compromise under our </p>
<p>combined pressure and general exhaustion here in New York, have all added up </p>
<p>to a less troublesome day than we might have expected.</p>
<p>“Clearly key decisions on the resolution will be made at the Summit. In addition </p>
<p>to any other instructions, grateful if you could consider whether it is worth giving </p>
<p>UNMOVIC/IAEA and the UN advance notice of any announcement on next steps so </p>
<p>that they can make the earliest possible preparations to evacuate staff from Iraq …”</p>

<p>had “committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] paragraph 4 of </p>

<p>192</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Mr David Brummell, Legal Secretary to the Law Officers, wrote to Mr Rycroft </p>
<p>on 14 March:</p>
<p>“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further resolution </p>
<p>of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has failed to comply </p>
<p>with and co-operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 and has thus </p>
<p>failed to take the final opportunity offered by the Security Council in that resolution. </p>
<p>The Attorney General understands that it is unequivocally the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>view that Iraq has committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] </p>
<p>paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, but as this is a judgment for the Prime Minister, the </p>
<p>Attorney would be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell’s letter the following day, stating:</p>
<p>“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view that Iraq is </p>
<p>in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 of UNSCR 1441, because of </p>
<p>‘false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this </p>
<p>resolution and failure to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation of, </p>

<p><b>578. </b> It is unclear what specific grounds Mr Blair relied upon in reaching his view.</p>

<p>THE FCO PAPER OF 15 MARCH, ‘IRAQI NON-COMPLIANCE WITH UNSCR 1441’</p>
<p><b>582.  A paper for publication providing examples of Iraq’s failure to comply with </b></p>
<p><b>the obligations imposed by the UN was produced by the FCO on 15 March.</b></p>
<p><b>583. </b> The question of what would constitute a further material breach as specified in </p>
<p>OP4 of resolution 1441 (2002) was the subject of considerable debate within the UK </p>
<p>Government in late 2002 (see Section 3.6).</p>
<p><b>584. </b> In January 2003, Mr Blair said that, if the inspectors’ reports established a pattern </p>
<p>of non-compliance, they would, in the absence of other evidence that Iraq had concealed </p>
<p>WMD (a “smoking gun”), be sufficient to secure Security Council support for a second </p>
<p>resolution stating that Iraq was in further material breach of resolution 1441.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>585. </b> Mr Blair proposed that the US and UK should seek to persuade others, including </p>
<p>Dr Blix, that this was the “true view” of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>586. </b> By the end of January, Mr Blair had taken a public position that Iraq was failing </p>
<p>fully to comply with resolution 1441, and that that was a further material breach (see </p>
<p>Section 3.6).</p>
<p><b>587. </b> In his advice of 7 March, Lord Goldsmith said that the views of UNMOVIC and the </p>
<p>IAEA would be highly significant in demonstrating hard evidence of non-compliance and </p>
<p>non-co-operation.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>588. </b> In his minute to Mr Blair of 11 March, Mr Straw wrote that the:</p>
<p>“… three recent meetings of the [Security] Council more than fulfil the requirement </p>
<p>for immediate consideration of reports of non-compliance. So we can say </p>
<p>convincingly that the process set out in resolution 1441 is complete.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>589. </b> Mr Straw suggested that the UK Government should use “the overwhelming </p>
<p>evidence that Iraq has not used the four months” since the adoption of resolution 1441 </p>
<p>“to co-operate ‘immediately, unconditionally and actively’” to make a “more compelling” </p>
<p>case to Parliament and public opinion. The UNMOVIC “clusters” document would be </p>
<p>a material help in making that case”.</p>

<p>to “demonstrate clearly the extent of Iraqi intransigence” was sent to Mr Straw’s Private </p>

<p><b>591. </b> The paper was referred to in a note on the Attorney General’s file, in relation to </p>
<p>the need for “further material to be assembled” as discussed by Lord Goldsmith and </p>
<p>Mr Straw, in their meeting late on 13 March, to provide “evidence showing” that Iraq was </p>
<p>“in further material breach”. That listed a need for:</p>
<p>“</p>

<p>Any examples of false statements/omissions and (significant) non-co-operation </p>
<p>reported to Security Council pursuant to OP4 of SCR 1441.</p>

<p>Goldsmith’s behalf:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Demonstration of breaches of UNSCR 1441 are critical to our legal case. </p>
<p>Therefore we must be scrupulously careful to ensure that the best examples </p>
<p>of non-compliance are referred to.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It would be distinctly unhelpful to our legal case if the examples of non </p>
<p>compliance … were weak or inadequate; and it would be difficult – indeed it </p>
<p>would be too late – to seek to add further (better) examples ‘after the event’.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO needed to check the document they were preparing “very carefully” </p>
<p>and subject it to “the tightest scrutiny”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The document should include “a caveat … acknowledging that the examples </p>
<p>of non-compliance … were not exhaustive but illustrative”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The submission to Mr Straw should reflect those points.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Mr Brummell’s record of his conversation with Ms Owen on 14 March also </p>
<p>stated that he had been informed that the FCO paper would be sent out with a letter </p>

<p><b>594. </b> The FCO paper was finalised on 15 March.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> It was produced by officials in the </p>
<p>FCO but drawn largely from official reports and statements by UN inspectors. It drew </p>
<p>heavily on UNMOVIC’s report, ‘Unresolved Disarmament Issues – Iraq’s Proscribed </p>
<p>Weapons Programmes’, the “clusters” document, which it characterised as  </p>
<p>“a 173 page-long catalogue of Iraqi intransigence since 1991”.</p>
<p><b>595. </b> The paper examined the extent of Iraq’s non-compliance with the obligations </p>
<p>placed upon it by the UN Security Council in resolution 1441, which it stated was </p>
<p>“unambiguous”. Resolution 1441:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognised the threat which Iraq’s non-compliance “and proliferation of weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and long-range missiles” posed to international peace and </p>
<p>security (preambular paragraph (PP) 3);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decided that Iraq had been and remained “in material breach of its obligations </p>
<p>under relevant resolutions” (OP1);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decided to “afford Iraq … a final opportunity to comply” (OP2); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decided that “false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by </p>
<p>Iraq … and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and co-operate fully in the </p>
<p>implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of </p>
<p>Iraq’s obligations” (OP4).</p>
<p><b>596. </b> Assessing Iraq’s “progress in complying with relevant provisions of UNSCR 1441”, </p>
<p>the paper stated that Iraq had “Not met” the requirement in five areas and had only </p>
<p>“Partially met” or “Not yet met” other demands.</p>
<p><b>597. </b> The FCO paper stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “Not met” the requirement for a “currently accurate, full, and </p>
<p>complete declaration of all aspects of its programmes”. The Iraqi declaration, </p>
<p>of 7 December, “did not contain any new information to answer any of the </p>
<p>outstanding questions”, and there were “significant falsehoods”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had not provided UNMOVIC and the IAEA with “immediate, unimpeded, </p>
<p>unrestricted, and private access to all officials and other persons whom </p>
<p>UNMOVIC or the IAEA wish to interview”. Only 16 interviews had taken </p>
<p>place and there was “reason to believe” that the Iraqi authorities had </p>
<p>intimidated interviewees.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No interviews had taken place outside Iraq. The paper cited “evidence that </p>
<p>Iraqi scientists have been intimidated into refusing interviews … They – and </p>
<p>their families – have been threatened with execution if they deviate from the </p>
<p>official line.”</p>

<p>Iraq had not provided UNMOVIC and the IAEA with “the names of all personnel </p>
<p>currently and formerly associated with Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear, and </p>
<p>ballistic missile programmes and the associated … facilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was not co-operating “immediately, unconditionally, and actively with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA”. It had not answered the outstanding questions </p>
<p>raised by UNSCOM when it was forced to withdraw or by the 1999 Amorim </p>
<p>panel (see Section 1.1).</p>
<p><b>598. </b> The list of unresolved “outstanding issues” included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Failure to account adequately for SCUD-type missiles and components </p>
<p>‘suggests that these items may have been retained for a prohibited </p>
<p>missile force’.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Failure to explain why Iraq has built a missile test stand at al-Rafah that </p>
<p>can accommodate missiles with over four times the thrust of the prohibited </p>
<p>Al Samoud missile.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[A]t least 80 tonnes (in 550 shells and 450 aerial bombs)” of “unaccounted for” </p>
<p>mustard gas, and that quantity “could be substantially higher”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether Iraq had retained “some capability with regard to VX”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether Iraq’s claimed destruction of bulk agent, including anthrax, in 1991 </p>
<p>had occurred.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Failure to account for the aircraft associated with the L-29 RPV programme.</p>
<p><b>599. </b> The FCO paper also stated that Iraq had only:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Partially met” the requirement for free and unrestricted use of aircraft “belatedly </p>
<p>and under pressure”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Not yet met” the requirement to destroy Al Samoud missiles and associated </p>
<p>equipment. It stated that the programme of destruction had started by the </p>
<p>deadline set by UNMOVIC, but suggested it could be stopped “at any time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Partially met” the requirement not to “take or threaten hostile acts”, although </p>
<p>it stated “inspections had been largely incident-free”.</p>
<p><b>600. </b> The paper also identified Iraqi “gestures” which it characterised as examples </p>

<p><b>601. </b> The paper was sent to all Members of Parliament on 17 March.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>602.  The statements in the FCO paper about Iraq’s approach to interviews and its </b></p>

<p><b>603.  The FCO paper did not evaluate the seriousness of either the five </b></p>
<p><b>requirements which Iraq had “Not met” or the other areas where Iraq had only </b></p>
<p><b>“Partially met” or “Not yet met” the requirement.</b></p>
<p><b>604. </b> The way in which that intelligence was drawn on in briefings for and statements </p>
<p>by Ministers, and the withdrawal of some of the reporting in September 2004, is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>605. </b> OP11 of resolution 1441 (2002) directed Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei “to report </p>
<p>immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspection activities, as well as </p>
<p>any failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations, including its obligations </p>
<p>regarding inspections under this resolution”.</p>
<p><b>606. </b> OP12 recorded that the Security Council had decided “to convene immediately </p>
<p>upon receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 … in order to consider </p>
<p>the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions </p>
<p>in order to secure international peace and security”.</p>
<p><b>607. </b> The FCO paper did not mention that OP4 of resolution 1441 required a further </p>
<p>material breach to be “reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with </p>
<p>paragraphs 11 and 12” of the resolution. Nor did it contain any reference to the Security </p>
<p>Council having done so.</p>
<p><b>608. </b> In setting out the analysis, there were a number of salient points the FCO paper </p>
<p>did not make, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix had reminded Mr Blair on 6 February that the material described as </p>
<p>“unaccounted for” in UNSCOM’s report of 1999 was not necessarily present in </p>
<p>Iraq; and that it would be “paradoxical to go to war for something that might turn </p>
<p>out to be very little”.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix made a similar point in his report to the Security Council on 7 March.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The quantities of material described as “unaccounted for” were estimates </p>
<p>extrapolated from data in UNSCOM official records.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix had not at that point requested any interviews outside Iraq. </p>
<p>He told the Security Council on 7 March that he would be requesting such </p>
<p>interviews “shortly”.</p>
<p>• </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>504</p>
<p><b>609. </b> UNMOVIC had informed Sir Jeremy Greenstock on 11 March that Iraq had </p>
<p>provided names of personnel currently and formerly associated with Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes and had said “they were willing to provide more in particular areas </p>
<p>on request”.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>610. </b> Dr Blix’s reports to the Security Council presented a nuanced picture. He did </p>
<p>not say that Iraq was complying, but neither he nor Dr ElBaradei had reported to the </p>
<p>Security Council that Iraq was not complying or that the inspectors could not complete </p>
<p>their tasks.</p>
<p><b>611. </b> In his report of 7 March, Dr Blix stated that, when the quarterly report had been </p>
<p>finalised, there had still been “relatively little tangible progress to note” and the report </p>
<p>had been “cautious”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> By 7 March, however, there was more. Iraq had accepted </p>
<p>the destruction of Al Samoud 2 missiles and associated items and that constituted </p>
<p>a “substantial measure of disarmament … the first since the middle 1990s”.</p>
<p><b>612. </b> In relation to other recent Iraqi initiatives, Dr Blix stated:</p>
<p>“One can hardly avoid the impression that, after a period of somewhat reluctant </p>
<p>co-operation, there has been an acceleration of initiatives from the Iraqi side since </p>
<p>the end of January. This is welcome, but the value of these measures must be </p>
<p>soberly judged by how many question marks they actually succeed in straightening </p>
<p>out. This is not yet clear.”</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Dr Blix added that Iraq had not “persisted” in attaching conditions to inspections. </p>
<p>Recent Iraqi initiatives could not be said “to constitute ‘immediate’ co-operation. Nor do </p>
<p>they necessarily cover all areas of relevance”; but they were “nevertheless welcome”.</p>
<p><b>614. </b> Dr Blix was not reporting that he was unable to carry out inspections. He stated </p>
<p>that “Even with a pro-active Iraqi attitude” it would still take “months” to “verify sites </p>
<p>and items, analyse documents, interview relevant persons and draw conclusions”. </p>
<p>A document addressing unresolved disarmament issues and to identify key remaining </p>
<p>disarmament tasks, as required by resolution 1284 (1999), would be submitted later </p>
<p>that month.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed nuclear </p>
<p>activities since the inspectors left in December 1998, and the recently increased level </p>
<p>of Iraqi co-operation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security Council with an </p>
<p>assessment of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in the near future.</p>

<p><b>616. </b> Dr Blix told the Inquiry that he had been “pushed very hard” to conduct interviews </p>
<p>abroad.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> Resolution 1441 had provided for such interviews but did not say they were </p>
<p>mandatory. He:</p>
<p>“… never thought that you would get much out of it. It would only have been trouble, </p>
<p>but we would have been driven to it in the end. I think the push was so hard, so we </p>
<p>would have persuaded the Iraqis …”</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Dr Blix added that he did not think interviews outside Iraq were realistic but he </p>
<p>would have pursued them if there had been more time: “The pressure from the British </p>
<p>was also strong. [Mr] Blair felt very strongly about it.”</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>Events of 15 and 16 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>618. </b> In the entry in his diaries for 15 March, Mr Campbell wrote that there was a </p>
<p>meeting with Mr Blair at 8.30am. He was “clear now what the French would try – yes to </p>
<p>the tests, even to the possibility of military action, but they would push for a later date”.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>619. </b> That had been followed by a pre-meeting with Mr Prescott, Mr Brown and </p>
<p>Mr Douglas Alexander, Minister of State at the Cabinet Office. Mr Campbell commented:</p>
<p>“GB [Gordon Brown] was beginning to motor a bit, firing with good media and </p>
<p>political lines. He also felt we needed to explain more clearly why we had been so </p>
<p>keen to get the second resolution when now we were saying we didn’t need one. </p>
<p>The answer lay in the pressure we had been putting on the Iraqis, through the </p>
<p>building of international support. He also felt that we should be pressing publicly </p>
<p>over some of the questions he felt Blix had not fully answered.</p>
<p>“Goldsmith was happy for us to brief that in the coming days he would make clear </p>
<p>there was a legal base for action. We now had to build up the Azores as a genuine </p>
<p>diplomatic effort, which was not going to be easy …</p>
<p>“John Scarlett [Chairman of the JIC] joined us, reported signs of the Iraqis really </p>
<p>hunkering down, said there were reports of summary executions …</p>
<p>“Godric [Smith – Mr Blair’s Official Spokesman] and I were briefing Ministers and </p>
<p>then the media re the forthcoming AG [Attorney General] advice. A few decisions </p>
<p>having been taken, the travel of direction clear, we felt in a stronger position.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>506</p>
<p>THE FCO GAME PLAN</p>
<p><b>620. </b> A Note for the Record written by Mr McDonald on 15 March reported that Cabinet </p>
<p>on 17 March would need:</p>
<p>“… to be choreographed with the Security Council meeting where Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock would announce that we were pulling our resolution.</p>
<p>“The Foreign Secretary assumed the Cabinet would meet sometime in the morning. </p>
<p>It will need specifically to approve the course of action proposed and to have passed </p>
<p>across the terms of the Commons motion for Tuesday.</p>
<p>“… it might be a good idea for him [Mr Straw] to do a statement on Monday to inform </p>
<p>colleagues of the decision to withdraw … A statement … might give us a better </p>
<p>chance of assessing from where the strongest arguments would come.”</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>621. </b> The FCO advised No.10 that the UK’s “aim should be to leave the current </p>
<p>diplomatic process in a way that helps ensure that we can return to the Council shortly </p>
<p>for action on other important areas, such as amending the Iraq sanctions regime and </p>
<p>obtaining UN authorisation of post conflict arrangements”.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> That could best be done by </p>
<p>a “short statement” by Sir Jeremy Greenstock in informal Council consultations, making </p>
<p>clear that the UK “regretted that it had proved impossible to make progress on our text </p>
<p>and that we were not taking any further action on it”: “Ideally this should coincide with </p>
<p>any US announcement of a short final ultimatum to Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>622. </b> The FCO also identified the risk of a resolution being tabled in the Security </p>
<p>Council or the UN General Assembly criticising the use of force; the need to address </p>
<p>travel advice and the safety of UK nationals in the region; and the reaction to the US </p>
<p>announcement about publishing a Road Map on the MEPP.</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Mr Ricketts subsequently advised that Sir Jeremy Greenstock had pointed out “that </p>
<p>we should try to keep the issue open in the Security Council for as long as possible in </p>
<p>order to minimise the risk of rival initiatives”; and that “a key element” of that strategy </p>
<p>would be “to ensure that we do not say we are closing down or giving up on the Security </p>
<p>Council route”.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>624. </b> Sir David Manning recorded that Mr Blair had made those points “strongly” at the </p>
<p>Azores Summit.</p>

<p><b>625. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that it was his “responsibility not to be </p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 15 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>627.  In his discussion with President Bush on 15 March, Mr Blair proposed that </b></p>
<p><b>the main message from the Azores Summit should be that it was the final chance </b></p>
<p><b>for Saddam Hussein to demonstrate that he had taken the strategic decision to </b></p>
<p><b>avert war; and that members of the Security Council should be able to sanction </b></p>
<p><b>the use of force as Iraq was in material breach of its obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>628.  The UK would take the decision on the timing for bringing the UN process </b></p>
<p><b>to an end on 17 March.</b></p>
<p><b>629.  President Bush was trying to help Mr Blair achieve a majority for military </b></p>
<p><b>action in the Parliamentary Labour Party before the House of Commons vote </b></p>
<p><b>on</b> <b>18 March.</b></p>
<p><b>630. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 15 March, he thanked him for the </p>
<p>announcement on the MEPP.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>631. </b> Mr Blair said that the main message for the Azores Summit should be that this </p>
<p>was a final chance for the UN to deliver, and that countries should be able to sanction </p>
<p>the use of force as Iraq was in material breach. They discussed the positions of various </p>
<p>countries and Mr Blair underlined the importance of appearing as reasonable as possible </p>
<p>when we pulled the UN resolution. The timing of that decision would be for the UK.</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the role of the UN post-conflict, the </p>
<p>need to have a post-conflict strategy to deal with the opponents of military action, and </p>
<p>the consequences of the experience on Iraq for the UN in the longer term.</p>
<p><b>633. </b> Mr Blair’s attempts to agree the role of the UN post-conflict with the US are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell provided a long account of the conversation, including:</p>
<p>“He [President Bush] accepted that we had done the right thing on the Road Map. </p>
<p>‘Good advice and it has helped a lot.’ …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>“Bush was pretty vile about Fox, Chirac and Schröder [Mr Gerhard Schröder, the </p>
<p>German Chancellor] and to a lesser extent Lagos. He wanted to go for a ‘coalition </p>
<p>of the willing’ meeting next week …</p>
<p>“TB said it was time for the UN to show it could do its job.</p>
<p>“Bush said that anything that weakened 1441 was not on. His plan now was:  </p>
<p>1. get through Monday, 2. get through our vote; then 3. Coalition of the willing.</p>
<p>“He and TB then came up with the idea of doing the press conference before rather </p>
<p>than after the meeting in the Azores. I was opposed, felt it would fuel the idea it was </p>
<p>all a charade …</p>
<p>“His [Bush’s] main line was that anything that takes us back from 1441 was not </p>
<p>enough. This was the final stage of the diplomacy.</p>
<p>“TB said the UN had to be seen to do its job.</p>
<p>“Bush felt the TB lines re the divisions being between those prepared to use force </p>
<p>and those who were not would come best from TB not him … He said we have to </p>
<p>come to a conclusion at the UN. If we issue an ultimatum and the prospect of force, </p>
<p>and France says no, it becomes impossible.</p>
<p>“TB said he still thought Chirac might say yes, but with a delay.</p>
<p>“Bush said that if he went for yes with twenty-one days, he would reject it. They are </p>
<p>the ones being unreasonable, not us.</p>
<p>“TB said he would definitely lose … RC [Robin Cook] …</p>
<p>“TB said he was not sure where Kofi [Annan] was.</p>
<p>“Bush said he had totally different problems to us re the UN … the pressure in the </p>
<p>States was to bury it. Then ‘I told Fox he has seriously messed up. He has really let </p>
<p>me down on this.’ …”</p>

<p><b>635.  Mr Brenton reported that President Bush was determined to remove Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein and to stick to the US timetable for action.</b></p>
<p><b>636.  The UK’s “steadfastness” had been “invaluable” in bringing in other </b></p>
<p><b>countries in support of action. Helping Mr Blair to make the transition from the </b></p>
<p><b>UN process to military action was in the US’s own interests.</b></p>

<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>509</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Advising on the perspective from Washington, Mr Brenton reported that President </p>
<p>Bush was:</p>
<p>“… utterly determined to get Saddam out. In retrospect it looks as if he finally and </p>
<p>firmly reached that conclusion in early December at the time of the false Iraqi </p>
<p>declaration. The entire subsequent action has been driven by it. This is a President </p>
<p>who sets targets and expects his subordinates to deliver. Hence the ironclad </p>
<p>determination of the timetable (which has hardly budged in three months) and the </p>
<p>occasionally visible uneasiness about focusing exclusively on disarmament and </p>
<p>sticking to the UN route (in case we got the answer ‘yes’). This does not mean that </p>
<p>Bush wants to go to war, but the bottom line is that Saddam must go.”</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>638. </b> Mr Brenton added that President Bush “had every reason to feel confident” about </p>
<p>military action:</p>
<p>“The chief current nightmare in the Pentagon and intelligence community is </p>
<p>‘catastrophic success’ – a collapse of resistance in Iraq which moves too fast for us </p>
<p>instantly to establish order in its wake. Of course nothing is certain and there are </p>
<p>downside scenarios … But the high probability projection is for a quick and relatively </p>
<p>clean victory.</p>
<p>“As you know, the US are ready to start the (short) countdown to military action </p>
<p>next week.”</p>
<p><b>639. </b> President Bush also had domestic political grounds for confidence as the </p>
<p>conviction that war is inevitable “had taken hold”. Liberal politicians had “kept their heads </p>
<p>down”, and conservative commentators had “grown increasingly impatient with the </p>
<p>UN’s delays”.</p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Brenton wrote that the US Administration had, however, “been shocked” at their </p>
<p>“inability” to get Turkey on board and the “failure, despite what they see as vigorous </p>
<p>arm twisting, to get a majority for a second … resolution”. The State Department was </p>
<p>“concerned at images of US unilateralism” and was:</p>
<p>“… working hard at giving the ‘coalition’ of supportive countries a more visible </p>
<p>presence. In this optic, the steadfastness of UK support, bringing with it other </p>
<p>key players … had been invaluable to them. The President is thus concerned </p>
<p>about the Prime Minister’s present political difficulties not only out of fellow feeling </p>
<p>(… a genuinely significant factor …) but also out of self interest. It would be </p>
<p>massively damaging for US interests for the British Government to fall because of </p>
<p>our support in Iraq. The US will go to great lengths to help it not happen (as indeed </p>
<p>they have started to do with their announcement on the Road Map).”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>510</p>
<p><b>641. </b> Mr Brenton concluded:</p>
<p>“At the Azores Summit … Bush will be looking for a way of making the transition </p>
<p>from the UN process to the military countdown in a manner maximally helpful to the </p>
<p>Prime Minister. A key component of this will be the announcement of our intentions </p>
<p>for a post-Saddam Iraq, and in particular the level of UN involvement in administering. </p>
<p>[…] and there is a clear US red line on fighting to liberate Iraq and then handing </p>
<p>the governance over to the UN. Extensive UN involvement short of this ought to </p>
<p>be achievable, and is a prize worth fighting for.”</p>
<p><b>642. </b> Mr Blair saw the telegram on the way to the Azores Summit.</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Mr Sherard Cowper-Coles, the British Ambassador to Israel, subsequently </p>
<p>reported that there were some suggestions that the announcement of the Road Map </p>
<p>had been a gesture to help Mr Blair; and that “as such it should not be taken too </p>
<p>seriously by Israel”.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>MR BLAIR’S CONTACTS WITH OTHER LEADERS</p>
<p><b>644.  Mr Blair contacted a number of leaders to prepare the ground for the </b></p>
<p><b>announcement that the UK would be taking no further action on the draft </b></p>
<p><b>resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>645. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that in the conversation with Mr John Howard, the Australian </p>
<p>Prime Minister, on 15 March, Mr Howard asked “if the diplomatic process was dead”.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied that it had “reached an impasse. The process would struggle on until </p>
<p>Monday. Even the Russian position was making things difficult.”</p>
<p><b>646. </b> Mr Blair added that “a way forward could have been found” if everyone had </p>
<p>supported the proposals tabled by the UK the previous week; the “US had not been </p>
<p>eager about the proposals, but they were prepared to go along with them. The tests </p>
<p>had been taken from the Inspectors’ own reports – they were perfectly reasonable.” </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “now busy hiding material around Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>647. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Howard also discussed the effect of the French veto which </p>
<p>the “elected six”’ were “hiding behind”. The implication would be that the US, UK and </p>
<p>Australian troops should stay in the region indefinitely; without forces in the region the </p>
<p>inspectors would be “kicked out”. If it was clear the diplomatic process was not going </p>
<p>to proceed, there was little point in putting the resolution to a vote.</p>
<p><b>648. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Howard also discussed the role of the UN and international </p>
<p>financial institutions after conflict and the importance of a Road Map for the MEPP.</p>

<p><b>649. </b> In response to a letter from Mr Atal Vajpayee, the Prime Minister of India, </p>
<p>proposing a summit-level meeting of the leaders of the five Permanent Members of </p>
<p>the Security Council about the situation in Iraq, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“… the current situation in Iraq poses many challenges for the international </p>
<p>community. How we handle this issue will have wide-ranging global implications </p>
<p>for many years to come. It is for this reason that we and other UNSC members are </p>
<p>working so hard to secure a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>“I am conscious that all P5 members have a duty to do everything within their power </p>
<p>to resolve this issue without eroding the authority of the UN system. I am meeting </p>
<p>my US and Spanish counterparts on 16 March in the hope that a way can be found </p>
<p>to bridge the differences within the Security Council. I hope that the UK and India will </p>
<p>keep in very close touch as the situation develops.”</p>

<p><b>650. </b> In a discussion with President Lagos about the Chilean proposal, the position of </p>
<p>the “elected six” and the position of the US and other members of the Security Council, </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that there were concerns that the “elected six” document would be “used </p>
<p>by the French to cause further delay”.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> Time was running out. It was clear from his </p>
<p>conversation with President Chirac the previous day that France “would still not accept </p>
<p>the automatic use of force or an ultimatum in the event of non-compliance”.</p>
<p><b>651. </b> President Lagos stated that benchmarks without a timeline would result in </p>
<p>endless discussion, but it was not clear what the Security Council could do and time was </p>
<p>running out. Secretary Powell had told the Mexican Foreign Minister that the US did not </p>
<p>want any further movement at the UN.</p>
<p><b>652. </b> President Lagos was reported to have stated that he:</p>
<p>“… had acted in good faith, but he would not do anything further. He was very mad </p>
<p>with the US response. They had assumed motives that were not true.”</p>
<p><b>653. </b> Mr Blair said he would have further discussions with the US and “there could be </p>
<p>a chance to squeeze things through”; and that “he thought there was still time and he </p>
<p>would keep trying until the last minute”.</p>
<p><b>654. </b> President Lagos responded that Mr Blair “knew where Chile stood and he was </p>
<p>sorry that they had not been able to achieve a successful outcome last week”.</p>
<p><b>655. </b> Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that the six tests tabled by the UK on 12 March:</p>
<p>“… were immediately rejected by France. Jacques Chirac gave a very strong </p>
<p>statement saying he would not support military action whatever the circumstances. </p>
<p>Dominique de Villepin … also then rejected the tests per se. This was before </p>

<p>“… the strength of the French statements of opposition and his internal politics made </p>

<p>TRIPARTITE DECLARATION, 15 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>657.  In a declaration on 15 March, France, with Germany and Russia, attempted </b></p>
<p><b>to secure support in the Security Council for continued inspections.</b></p>
<p><b>658. </b> In a declaration late on 15 March, France, Germany and Russia appealed to </p>
<p>Security Council members to “make every effort to ensure” that a peaceful approach </p>
<p>prevailed to meet the shared goal of the international community for the disarmament </p>
<p>of Iraq.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> The points made in the declaration included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspections regime in resolution 1441 was “unprecedented”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A reaffirmation that “nothing in current circumstances justifies abandoning the </p>
<p>inspections process or resorting to force”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “successive reports” to the Security Council by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had </p>
<p>shown that inspections were “producing results” and that disarmament of Iraq </p>
<p>had begun. There was “every reason to believe that it can be completed rapidly </p>
<p>and in accordance with the rules set out by the Council. Iraq, for its part, must </p>
<p>co-operate actively and unconditionally.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“France, Russia and Germany, supported by China” had “submitted proposals” </p>
<p>to achieve disarmament “by defining key disarmament tasks and establishing </p>
<p>a rigorous timetable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Suggestions in the same spirit” had “been put forward by other members of </p>
<p>the Council”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The unity of the Security Council could be preserved, and all members bore </p>
<p>“a particular responsibility for ensuring” it was “not divided at this crucial time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When UNMOVIC’s work programme was submitted to the Security Council, the </p>
<p>Council should meet “immediately thereafter at the ministerial level to approve </p>
<p>key disarmament tasks and establish an implementation timetable” which was </p>
<p>“both demanding and realistic”.</p>

<p>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, 16 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>660.  Mr Blair and other Ministers continued on 16 March to insist that there was </b></p>
<p><b>still time for a peaceful solution. They also drew attention to difficulties created </b></p>
<p><b>by President Chirac’s stance on a veto and dismissed the tripartite proposal to </b></p>
<p><b>extend the inspections process.</b></p>
<p><b>661. </b> In his interview on the <i>BBC’s Breakfast with Frost</i> programme on 16 March,  </p>
<p>Mr Brown focused on the Government’s wish to avoid military action.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> He stated  </p>
<p>that “obviously we don’t want war, we want peace, we want the diplomatic process to  </p>
<p>work”. The UK was not seeking military action: “Even now … Saddam Hussein could  </p>
<p>announce that he would comply and he would co-operate …” The “purpose of the  </p>
<p>second resolution was to put the maximum pressure on Saddam Hussein … that he  </p>
<p>had to disarm immediately and that he could not get off the hook”.</p>
<p><b>662. </b> Mr Brown stated:</p>
<p>“My view … and I think this is the view of Tony Blair, is that we should continue to </p>
<p>try, even now, even in these difficult times, to secure international agreement … to a </p>
<p>resolution that would involve international co-operation and force Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>to disarm. It is unfortunate that we have both got non-compliance on the part </p>
<p>of Iraq …</p>
<p>“And of course the other issue that makes it difficult is that at least one country has </p>
<p>said that although it has supported the resolutions that imply the use of force, that </p>
<p>they would not support a resolution now on the use of force, at this stage, whatever </p>
<p>the circumstances …</p>
<p>“… even today the focus is on seeing if we can move the diplomatic process </p>
<p>forward … even at this stage there are initiatives that can be taken that would move </p>
<p>it forward. I would like every one of the Security Council members to be in a position </p>
<p>to say that they would support the disarmament of Saddam Hussein.”</p>
<p><b>663. </b> Mr Brown added:</p>

<p>diplomatic way forward … I believe there are options still available to us and these </p>
<p>will be discussed today with President Bush … the important thing to recognise is </p>
<p>that when the international community passes its resolutions … it has got to show </p>
<p>that it’s got a mechanism for enforcing its will. And that was, of course, the purpose </p>
<p>of the second resolution, but … that could form initiatives that could be taken this </p>
<p>afternoon and later, to see if we can resolve this issue without military action.</p>
<p>“… Even now there are initiatives on the table that have been put forward by us and </p>
<p>others that may help us resolve the question of whether there can be international </p>
<p>co-operation but the blockage is the non-compliance of Saddam Hussein and … at </p>
<p>least one country saying … in what I think is unreasonable terms, that whatever the </p>
<p>circumstances … they would not consider the use of force. And that really deprives </p>
<p>us of a mechanism for action …”</p>
<p><b>664. </b> Mr Brown also stated that the Government would not be acting in the way it was </p>
<p>“unless it was satisfied that there was a legal basis for its actions”.</p>
<p><b>665. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell described a “long meeting” in Sir David Manning’s </p>
<p>office before leaving for the Azores, with Sir David, Baroness Morgan and Mr Rycroft, </p>
<p>who were joined by Mr Brown, Dr John Reid, Minister without Portfolio and Labour Party </p>
<p>Chairman, and Ms Armstrong.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>666. </b> The meeting had tried:</p>
<p>“… to boil down the central arguments and dividing lines now. I suggested we say we </p>
<p>intend to go back to the French and test their position – do they support any element </p>
<p>of what we are saying? Are they really saying there are no circumstances in which </p>
<p>they would support anything seen as a threat of military action. If they are, we go. </p>
<p>If not, we have to look again.</p>
<p>“David M said there was no indication the French intended to shift.</p>
<p>“GB did <i>Frost</i> and came back saying the really tough questions were in the field </p>
<p>of legality. GB also said if we are saying this is the final shot at diplomacy, what </p>
<p>are we actually saying we are going to do after today? Bush didn’t want a process </p>
<p>story but I suggested one, namely a last round of contacts at the UN post the </p>

<p>“willingness to be more co-operative”, that France:</p>
<p>“… would still not accept a resolution that contained an ultimatum or the </p>
<p>automatic use of force. They were only prepared to look at timing and benchmarks. </p>
<p>An impasse had been reached.”</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>668. </b> Subsequently, Mr Blair stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… the UN track was now quite difficult. The ‘elected six’ had been close </p>
<p>to agreement last week but were frightened off by pressure from Russia </p>
<p>and France.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “slim chance” of a majority in favour of a second resolution, “but </p>
<p>only with a big push”: “The problem was that once it became clear … France </p>
<p>was going to veto the elected six saw little point in putting the resolution to the </p>
<p>vote.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ideas put forward by Mr de Villepin were “yet another way of creating further </p>
<p>delays. The process was going round in circles.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… France, Germany and Russia had made an agreement that they would </p>
<p>act together. Russia would not countenance anything other than a peaceful </p>
<p>solution … France and Russia were prepared to veto a resolution containing </p>
<p>an ultimatum or the automatic use of force.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“China was one step removed … they would not use their veto.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… French and Russian statements that disarmament was happening went </p>
<p>against reality. Had the international community presented Saddam with a strong </p>
<p>ultimatum then he would probably have complied.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At the Azores Summit “they would try to give the UN one last chance”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… it had to be made clear – compliance or military action would follow”.</p>

<p><b>670. </b> Ms Short spoke to Mr Annan on 15 March. She recorded that he had:</p>

<p>516</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Ms Short also recorded that she had subsequently spoken to both Mr Brown </p>
<p>and Mr Blair. She had told Mr Brown, who “kept on about French” that he should </p>
<p>speak to Mr Annan. In response to a request for her view on announcing a UN lead on </p>
<p>reconstruction in the Azores, she told Mr Blair that if war was inevitable that was all he </p>
<p>had got. Mr Blair had said he would “still be open to other possibilities”.</p>
<p><b>672. </b> The FCO suggested that Mr Blair should talk to Mr Annan from the Azores with key </p>
<p>messages including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Exploring the scope for any remaining diplomacy (if relevant), including the </p>
<p>possibility of a final ultimatum to Saddam Hussein as the last window for a </p>
<p>peaceful solution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Discouraging any further visits to Baghdad (as suggested by Iraq – see Box </p>
<p>below), “whose only purpose would be to buy more time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Looking forward to the UN having “a significant role after any conflict in helping </p>
<p>Iraq move quickly towards new prosperity and stability”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hoping that Mr Annan could “work to improve the atmosphere in the Council </p>
<p>and keeping the UN steady”.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>Iraqi actions</b></p>
<p>Iraq also sought to deflect military action.</p>
<p>Dr Blix wrote that a letter from Dr al-Sa’adi, Scientific Adviser to the Iraq Presidency </p>
<p>who represented Iraq in its negotiations with the UN, inviting Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to </p>
<p>visit Baghdad to try to accelerate the inspections process and take note of the progress </p>
<p>achieved, was received on 15 March.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had earlier concluded that any visit would need to be </p>
<p>preceded by a declaration from Saddam Hussein and that they would come to </p>
<p>discuss its implementation. Dr Blix informed Mr Annan, Ambassador Negroponte and </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
<p>Dr Blix wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy responded quickly; the UK Foreign Office urged caution. The bars for </p>
<p>a visit should be set high with the need not only for a declaration but also some </p>
<p>“down payment”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ambassador Negroponte “discouraged” a visit.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Annan advised that Dr al-Sa’adi should be asked to clarify more precisely what he </p>
<p>thought could be attained; and that the President of the Council should be informed.</p>
<p>On 16 March, Saddam Hussein was reported to have said that Iraq used to have weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction to defend itself against Iran and Israel, and that when he (Saddam) </p>
<p>said he had no weapons “he means what he says”.</p>

<p>before the Azores Summit.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>674. </b> Mr Blair reiterated his comment that an impasse had been reached:</p>
<p>“There was no point in passing a resolution, which was not backed by force because </p>
<p>Saddam would just ignore it. France had also rejected the tests Britain had put </p>
<p>forward last week. The problem with the latest French proposal was that after </p>
<p>allowing a further month of inspections, there would be yet another discussion and </p>
<p>we would be back to where we started. Clear tests were needed … but the French </p>
<p>would not accept that. It was very difficult to see a way through.”</p>
<p><b>675. </b> Mr Blair added that: “Saddam would only comply if there was a clear threat of force.”</p>
<p><b>676. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Annan also discussed the importance of a strong UN role in </p>
<p>post-conflict Iraq, the need for a relationship between the UN and “whoever was </p>
<p>occupying Iraq” and a resolution establishing the relationship between the occupying </p>
<p>force and occupied Iraq.</p>
<p>THE AZORES SUMMIT, 16 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>677.  At the Azores Summit it was agreed that unless there was a fundamental </b></p>
<p><b>change in the next 24 hours, the UN process would end.</b></p>
<p><b>678.  In public the focus was on a “last chance for peace”. The joint communiqué </b></p>
<p><b>contained a final appeal to Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and </b></p>
<p><b>to the Security Council to back a second resolution containing an ultimatum.</b></p>
<p><b>679. </b> When President Bush, Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and Mr Barroso met in the Azores, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated that the meeting:</p>
<p>“… had to send a message that this was the final appeal to Saddam to comply, and </p>
<p>to the Security Council to back a second resolution containing an ultimatum.”</p>
<p>234</p>
<p><b>680. </b> They also discussed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to avoid an alternative resolution which might secure enough support </p>
<p>to delay action.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The likelihood that the invasion would be welcomed but the risk that there would </p>
<p>be communal violence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The role the UN should play, including that it would not be able to deal with </p>
<p>communal violence. That would need to be “handled rapidly by the military”.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>518</p>
<p><b>681. </b> Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“The point of decision had arrived. It had been an agonising process going through </p>
<p>the UN. But the justification had been that we had to look at every alternative before </p>
<p>turning to military action. We should now be prepared to explain that continued </p>
<p>non-compliance by Saddam Hussein could not be met by another discussion. </p>
<p>We had made every effort … We had to explain yet again that unless there </p>
<p>was effective pressure on Saddam, he would never comply. Yet the French and </p>
<p>Russians made it impossible to bring that pressure to bear. We should now engage </p>
<p>in a last round of final contacts, and appeal to the Security Council to take its </p>
<p>responsibilities seriously.”</p>
<p><b>682. </b> Mr Blair added there was “24 hours to assess whether there had been a </p>
<p>fundamental change … If not … we should be ready for military action”. He would be </p>
<p>content to ask Sir Jeremy Greenstock to take the draft resolution off the table “tomorrow </p>
<p>morning ‘if there had been no lightning strike’. He would do so on behalf of the </p>
<p>three co-sponsors.”</p>
<p><b>683. </b> Mr Blair stated that the role of the UN in post-conflict Iraq must be defined </p>
<p>very carefully:</p>
<p>“We must give the impression that the administration was under UN authority. </p>
<p>The clearer the UN role, the better. It was vital that UK public opinion understood </p>
<p>that we were not taking possession of Iraq’s oil.”</p>
<p><b>684. </b> Mr Blair also stated that the UN should be seen to give overall authorisation but it </p>
<p>could certainly not run everything. He wanted the UN Security Council to remain seized </p>
<p>of the Iraqi issue.</p>
<p><b>685. </b> The record of the discussion was to be seen by Mr Straw and Mr Hoon and their </p>
<p>Principal Private Secretaries.</p>
<p><b>686. </b> Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Bush talked about it being a last effort. But he said it was important the world </p>
<p>saw we were making every effort to enforce 1441. He said everyone had to </p>
<p>be able to say we did everything we could to avoid war. But this was the final </p>
<p>moment, the moment of truth, which was the line most of the media ran with. </p>
<p>He stressed he wanted the UN to play an important role in the post-Saddam </p>
<p>era. He was clear we had to emphasise Iraq’s territorial integrity. He was </p>
<p>emphasising he really would move on MEPP. He said again TB had been right to </p>
<p>push him on the Road Map, and said he intended to spend a lot of time on this. </p>
<p>He said re Chirac ‘I don’t want to provoke him into unreasonableness.’ He was </p>
<p>however keen to say he wanted the UN properly involved in the post-Saddam </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“TB said we had reached the point of decision for people. We had been there </p>
<p>before but there really had to be a decision. How many times could there be </p>
<p>a last chance, serious consequences for material breach? He reported that </p>
<p>Kofi [Annan] had said the French and Russians would not rule out force but </p>
<p>would not agree to an ultimatum, which was an odd position. He really hit the </p>
<p>UN buttons post-Saddam, and was trying to force Bush to go further on that. </p>
<p>‘It has to be a UN-authorised government.’ He was also hammering home the </p>
<p>advantages on MEPP, but I wasn’t convinced it would happen.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We needed some kind of process story so I suggested to TB they all instruct </p>
<p>their ambassadors at the UN to have one last go, see if the position of the others </p>
<p>had changed.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“TB was constantly emphasising final appeal, final opportunity.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Bush was scathing re the Turks … He was pretty keen to get on with things </p>
<p>now, wanted to pull down the SCR now. He then said he would address the </p>
<p>American people tomorrow – say diplomacy had failed, issue the ultimatum. </p>
<p>He said to TB we should say we were issuing one last set of instructions to UN </p>
<p>ambassadors to have a go at securing agreement.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Aznar was really pushing the importance of the transatlantic alliance, but he </p>
<p>was in even more political hot water on this than we were.”</p>
<p>235</p>
<p><b>687. </b> The ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’, issued at the Summit, and outlining the </p>
<p>challenge Saddam Hussein posed to the world, stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq’s talented people, rich culture, and tremendous potential had been </p>
<p>hijacked by Saddam Hussein”, whose “brutal regime had reduced” Iraq “to an </p>
<p>international pariah” that oppressed “its citizens, started two wars of aggression </p>
<p>against its neighbours” and still posed “a grave threat to the security of the </p>
<p>region and the world”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam’s defiance” of Security Council resolutions demanding disarmament </p>
<p>had “undermined the authority of the UN”. The international community had </p>
<p>“tried to persuade him to disarm and thereby avoid military conflict, most recently </p>
<p>through the unanimous adoption of resolution 1441”. If he refused “even now to </p>
<p>co-operate fully” with the UN, he brought “on himself the serious consequences </p>
<p>foreseen in resolution 1441 and previous resolutions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In these circumstances, we would undertake a solemn obligation to help the </p>
<p>Iraqi people build a new Iraq at peace with itself and its neighbours. The Iraqi </p>
<p>people deserve to be lifted from insecurity and tyranny, and freed to determine </p>
<p>for themselves the future of their country. We envisage a unified Iraq with its </p>

<p> Nations had “voiced a </p>
<p>commitment to peace and security” and now needed to demonstrate that “in the only </p>
<p>effective way, by supporting the immediate and unconditional disarmament of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>689. </b> In response to questions, President Bush added:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein could “leave the country if he’s interested in peace … the </p>
<p>decision is his to make”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>His speech of 12 September 2002 had “called the UN into account” because </p>
<p>he understood the “wars of the 21st century” were “going to require incredible </p>
<p>international co-operation”. He hoped that the following day the UN would </p>
<p>“do its job”.</p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Blair emphasised the “key point” was “our responsibility to uphold the will of the </p>
<p>United Nations set out in resolution 1441”, which had provided the final opportunity for </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to disarm and for “serious consequences” to follow if he failed to do so.</p>
<p><b>691. </b> In an oblique reference to France, Mr Blair stated that there was an “impasse” </p>
<p>where “some say there should be no ultimatum, no authorisation of force in any new </p>
<p>resolution”. He added:</p>
<p>“… without a credible ultimatum authorising force in the event of non-compliance, </p>
<p>then more discussion is just more delay, with Saddam remaining armed with </p>

<p>into some perpetual negotiation … but never real and concrete progress leading </p>
<p>to disarmament.”</p>

<p>is a way through this impasse. But … now is the time when we have to decide.”</p>
<p><b>694. </b> In response to a question, Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“So when people say we haven’t exhausted all the diplomatic avenues, we tried … </p>
<p>But … from our perspective and from the perspective of the security of the world, we </p>
<p>cannot simply go back to the Security Council, for this discussion to be superseded </p>
<p>by another discussion. That’s what happened for 12 years …”</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Dr Blix wrote that it seemed to him that there was a difference in tone between </p>
<p>President Bush and Mr Blair.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> The former had talked about “what a bright future Iraq </p>
<p>would have if Saddam was taken out”. Mr Blair had talked about “going the last mile </p>
<p>for peace and the need for the UN to stop a proliferator”. Dr Blix wrote: “Perhaps Blair </p>
<p>still had some hope that Saddam would crack … if he was faced with a unanimous </p>
<p>Council resolution.”</p>
<p><b>696. </b> Dr Blix recorded that Sir Jeremy Greenstock had “ventured” that the Azores </p>
<p>Summit was “about peace rather than about war”; but that the declaration seemed to </p>
<p>him to be “more belligerent than peaceful”. Dr Blix commented that:</p>
<p>“… the statement from the one-hour meeting was at this late stage perhaps less </p>
<p>of an ultimatum to Saddam than one to the members of the Security Council – to </p>
<p>support the resolution or be bypassed. The game was over … later that Sunday </p>
<p>afternoon I got the call from … Washington saying that it was time to withdraw our </p>
<p>inspectors from Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>697. </b> In his memoir, President Bush described the meeting as a “last-minute summit on </p>
<p>diplomatic strategy” where they had “all agreed the diplomatic track had reached its end. </p>
<p>We planned to withdraw the second resolution Monday morning.”</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>698. </b> President Bush wrote:</p>
<p>“I was deeply disappointed that diplomacy had failed but I had promised the </p>
<p>American people, our allies and the world that we would enforce the UN resolutions. </p>
<p>I was not going to break my word.</p>
<p>“For months I had solicited advice … Some believed we could contain Iraq by </p>
<p>keeping the inspectors in Iraq. But I didn’t see how. If we were to tell Saddam he </p>
<p>had another chance – after declaring this was his last chance – we would shatter </p>
<p>our credibility and embolden him.</p>

<p>“Others suggested that the threat wasn’t as serious as we thought … we had a </p>
<p>warning like a blaring siren. Years of intelligence pointed overwhelmingly to the </p>
<p>conclusion that Saddam had WMD. He had used them in the past. He had not met </p>
<p>his responsibility to prove their destruction. He had refused to co-operate with the </p>
<p>inspectors … The only logical conclusion was that he was hiding WMD. And given </p>
<p>his support of terror and his sworn hatred of America, there was no way to know </p>
<p>where those weapons would end up.</p>
<p>“Others alleged that America’s real intent was to control Iraq’s oil and satisfy Israel. </p>
<p>Those theories were false. I was sending our troops into combat to protect the </p>
<p>American people.</p>
<p>“I knew the cost would be high, but inaction had a cost, too. Given everything we </p>
<p>knew, allowing Saddam to remain in power would have amounted to an enormous </p>
<p>gamble. I would have had to bet that every major intelligence agency was wrong or </p>
<p>that Saddam would have a change of heart. After seeing the horror of 9/11, that was </p>
<p>not a chance I was willing to take. Military action was my last resort. But I believed </p>
<p>it was necessary.”</p>
<p>241</p>
<p><b>699. </b> Mr Blair described the Summit in his memoir as a:</p>
<p>“… slightly surreal event. On the face of it we were still pushing for a political </p>
<p>solution. There were some last minute hopes of an Arab initiative to get Saddam </p>
<p>out; or of a Saddam capitulation. George was content to adopt the line that we were </p>
<p>going to hold out every last hope for peace …</p>
<p>“We rehearsed again the main arguments. He was completely calm. He thought </p>
<p>we had to send out a message of total clarity to the world: have anything to do with </p>
<p>WMD and we are going to come after you. More even than me, he was focused on </p>
<p>the possibility of terrorist groups getting hold of WMD material: ‘I am just not going </p>
<p>to be the president on whose watch it happens’ …”</p>
<p>242</p>
<p><b>700. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“So when I look back … I know there was never any way Britain was not going to </p>
<p>be with the US at that moment, once we went down the UN route and Saddam was </p>
<p>in breach. Of course such a statement is always subject to <i>in extremis</i> correction. </p>
<p>A crazy act of aggression? No, we would not have supported that. But given the </p>
<p>history, you couldn’t call Saddam a crazy target.</p>
<p>“Personally I have little doubt that at some point we would have to have dealt with </p>
<p>him. But throughout I comforted myself, as I put it in the Glasgow speech, that if we </p>
<p>were wrong, we would have removed a tyrant; and as a matter of general principle, </p>
<p>I was in favour of doing that.</p>

<p>“Nonetheless, I was also aware that the very split in international opinion meant that </p>

<p>die was cast. I was aware of my isolation … my total dependence on things going </p>

<p><b>704. </b> In an interview broadcast on <i>CNN</i> on 16 March, during the Azores Summit, </p>
<p>President Chirac said that he hoped the Summit would recognise that inspections </p>
<p>provided an effective system “to achieve our common goal … the disarmament of Iraq, </p>
<p>elimination and destruction of her weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>705. </b> Asked about his bottom line for a compromise, President Chirac replied that was </p>
<p>a matter for the inspectors. In his view, the Security Council had unanimously:</p>
<p>“… decided to disarm Iraq peacefully through inspections for as long as the </p>
<p>inspectors consider this possible.”</p>
<p>“We see today … that a lot of progress has been achieved … admittedly we haven’t </p>
<p>reached the goal, but the inspectors consider … that we have the possibility of </p>
<p>reaching our goal without waging war. That is the goal I am seeking. I am totally </p>
<p>ready to accept all the practical arrangements that the inspectors will suggest …”</p>

<p><b>706. </b> Asked if he would be prepared to accept a 30- or 60-day deadline, President </p>
<p>Chirac stated that the inspectors’ advice must be accepted:</p>
<p>“We have given them a mission and we have a moral and political obligation to </p>
<p>accept their advice or else explain why we are not following it. But if we don’t follow </p>
<p>their advice, then only the Security Council can decide not to.”</p>
<p><b>707. </b> President Chirac added that it was in that spirit that France, Germany and Russia, </p>
<p>“supported today by China”, had proposed a Ministerial meeting of the Security Council </p>
<p>to discuss the inspectors’ proposed work programme.</p>
<p><b>708. </b> President Chirac accepted that US and British military pressure had achieved </p>
<p>a shift in Iraq’s position, adding that he considered:</p>
<p>“… the Americans have already won … without firing a shot… we should be thankful </p>
<p>to them for exercising that effective pressure. But that doesn’t mean that we have </p>
<p>to wage war if it isn’t necessary. And today, I don’t think it’s necessary.”</p>
<p><b>709. </b> Asked if it would have sent a stronger signal if France had also sent troops, </p>
<p>President Chirac replied that “from the very beginning” France felt that the process </p>
<p>of resolution 1441 “didn’t embrace the possibility of war”. That was why France was </p>
<p>“refusing today, and I mean today, the prospect of war”. If the strategy (of inspections) </p>
<p>failed, France would “refuse no solution, including war”.</p>
<p><b>710. </b> Asked if his repeated vow to veto had strengthened and emboldened Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein, President Chirac replied:</p>
<p>“I don’t think so at all and, in any case, it isn’t a relevant problem today … there isn’t </p>
<p>a majority on the Security Council for war …”</p>
<p><b>711. </b> Asked if he believed Iraq had chemical or biological weapons, President Chirac </p>
<p>replied: “I don’t know … we have no proof”, but that was the task for the inspectors.</p>
<p><b>712. </b> Asked in conclusion again why France hadn’t sent troops to exert pressure on </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, President Chirac replied that the US on its own was “exerting all the </p>
<p>pressure”; the British were “just making an additional contribution”. He wanted to “limit </p>
<p>the risks of war as far as possible”. He was “not a pacifist”, but “simply saying that war </p>
<p>is the last resort when everything else has been done. And we are not in that situation.”</p>
<p><b>713. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair said: “It was clear now … that the French did not </p>
<p>intend to move.”</p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>714. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that the briefing to the press on the aircraft on the way </p>
<p>back from the Azores made “clear that the French had to come back and say whether </p>
<p>there were any circumstances at all in which they might support military action”.</p>

<p>had been any change in their positions on the draft resolution.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>717. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock subsequently reported that the UK Mission in New York </p>
<p>had spoken to all Security Council colleagues with the message that:</p>
<p>“… there was now a short time left to consider whether the Council could agree at </p>
<p>last on an ultimatum to Saddam which, if he did not fulfil it, would result in serious </p>
<p>consequences. If their respective governments were in a position to engage in such </p>
<p>a discussion, I would need to hear it as early as possible on 17 March. When asked </p>
<p>(as the majority did), I said that I had no (no) instructions as to whether to put the </p>

<p>Mr de La Sablière had claimed that the French had moved significantly over the last two </p>

<p>counterparts to tell the press during the “late morning” of 17 March that there was </p>
<p>“no prospect of putting our resolution to the vote, casting heavy blame on the French”. </p>
<p>The key elements of the statement should be:</p>
<p>“(a)  the Azores Summit had called for a last effort to see if the Council could unite </p>
<p>around an ultimatum;</p>
<p>(b)  having contacted every member it was clear that Council consensus was not </p>
<p>possible within the terms of 1441, given the determination of one country in </p>
<p>particular to block any ultimatum;</p>
<p>(c)  we would therefore not be pursuing a vote;</p>

<p>last week an ultimatum which would challenge Iraq to take a strategic decision </p>
<p>to disarm.</p>
<p>“There were three key elements to the compromise we proposed …</p>
<p>“Having held further discussions with Council Members over the weekend and in the </p>
<p>last few hours, we have had to conclude that Council consensus will not be possible </p>
<p>… One country in particular has underlined its intention to veto any ultimatum ‘no </p>
<p>matter what the circumstances’. That country rejected our proposed compromise </p>
<p>before even the Iraqi government itself and has put forward suggestions that would </p>
<p>row back on the unanimous agreement of the Council in 1441 – those suggestions </p>
<p>would amount to no ultimatum/no pressure/and no disarmament.</p>

<p><b>732.  The subsequent discussion in the Council suggested that only the UK, the </b></p>
<p><b>US and Spain took the view that all options other than the use of military force </b></p>
<p><b>had been exhausted.</b></p>
<p><b>733.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had “highlighted the particular role played by </b></p>
<p><b>France – without naming her – in making agreement impossible”. Mr de La Sablière </b></p>
<p><b>had said shortly afterwards that the French position reflected the majority view </b></p>
<p><b>in the Council.</b></p>
<p><b>734. </b> In the subsequent Council meeting, which Sir Jeremy Green stock described </p>
<p>as a “downbeat and rather surreal affair”, France Germany and Russia continued to </p>
<p>push for an open Council meeting at Ministerial level to consider and approve the work </p>
<p>programme for the inspectors.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>735. </b> Mr Lavrov said the statement by France, Russia and Germany on 15 March spoke </p>
<p>for itself: “Inspections were actively under way and yielding results.” He wanted to hear </p>
<p>more from Dr Blix about recent steps by Iraq “on substance”. The Council should meet </p>
<p>at Ministerial level on 18 or 19 March to consider the work programme. Russia “took a </p>
<p>different approach based on the concrete facts that disarmament was working”.</p>
<p><b>736. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had “regretted that it was not possible to find a way </p>
<p>forward on an ultimatum that would both put pressure on Iraq to take the strategic </p>
<p>decision to disarm and maintain inspections as the tool”; and stated that the UK:</p>
<p>“… reserved the right to take steps that would deliver disarmament. While the </p>
<p>prospects for peace were very slim, it was still possible even at this late hour </p>
<p>for Saddam to take a strategic decision and the actions that would prove such </p>
<p>a decision. In the circumstances, our national advice to UNMOVIC/IAEA and UN </p>
<p>staff was that it would be prudent to suspend inspections and for staff to withdraw </p>
<p>immediately … we remained interested in the 1284 work programme against the </p>
<p>background of the slim possibility of a strategic decision by Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>737. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Negroponte told the Council that, given </p>
<p>the threat of a veto, there had been no purpose in pursuing the resolution any further. </p>
<p>The US had warned UNMOVIC and the IAEA the previous evening that it would be </p>
<p>necessary to evacuate their personnel: “War was not imminent but it would not be </p>
<p>possible to give further notice.”</p>
<p><b>738. </b> Mr de La Sablière was reported to have told the Council that:</p>
<p>“At a time when inspections were making progress and peaceful disarmament in </p>
<p>a limited time seems possible his delegation had indeed made clear that it would </p>
<p>oppose a resolution authorising force. But it was not a veto when the co-sponsors </p>
<p>did not have a majority – it was a straight no. The situation was serious but we </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>530</p>
<p>should continue to work for even the slightest likelihood of a peaceful outcome … </p>
<p>the Council should consider and approve the work programme and key tasks … </p>
<p>It was up to the inspectors to set the timetable … if they said a month was necessary, </p>
<p>France could live with that. In accordance with 1441 the Council would then evaluate </p>
<p>the situation. Automaticity was difficult for the French, as for the majority, as it </p>
<p>allowed for the use of force without a Council decision. We should continue to work </p>
<p>for peaceful disarmament – the basis supported by the majority of the delegations </p>
<p>and of the world.”</p>
<p><b>739. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Germany wanted the work programme to be discussed and approved: “As there </p>
<p>was not much difference between the UK proposal and the key tasks, it could, </p>
<p>even at this late hour, lead to consensus.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Spain had “concurred” with Sir Jeremy’s intervention.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Syria had argued that there was another course which would have led to </p>
<p>peaceful disarmament and supported the Russian position.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>China stated that if “withdrawing the resolution signalled a push for war, this </p>
<p>was very regrettable. Avoiding war was in the interest of all sides.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Chile “continued to believe that inspections and the persistent threat of force </p>
<p>could have achieved peaceful disarmament”. It had made a proposal “along </p>
<p>the lines in the UK compromise and designed to bridge the gap between the </p>
<p>different parties”, but it had been “rejected within half an hour”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mexico stated that there was “no justification or implicit authorisation for the </p>
<p>use of force”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bulgaria was “open to any initiative that might restore unity”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Angola stated that it had “always believed that all alternatives should be </p>
<p>exhausted before war. Unfortunately, this now appeared to be the case.” </p>
<p>If the proposed ministerial meeting “was just one more meeting we should let </p>
<p>things calm down first. If it could help to find a way forward, even at this late </p>
<p>hour, that was another matter.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cameroon appealed for dialogue, stating that the “failure to agree was a </p>
<p>disservice to multilateralism and the Council”. The draft Presidential statement </p>
<p>from the “undecided six” would have been “a platform for compromise”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Guinea “hoped for a miracle”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pakistan said that members should “continue to explore all possible approaches </p>
<p>for a unified Council. The Council should accept the work programme and </p>
<p>continue to appeal for a positive response from Iraq, even at this late stage.”</p>

<p><b>740. </b> In the light of misunderstandings in the Council, Sir Jeremy explained that </p>
<p>the co-sponsors:</p>
<p>“… were not withdrawing the resolution but, instead, not putting it to a vote. </p>
<p>The key to any chance for diplomacy lay in our being convinced that Iraq would </p>
<p>co-operate within the terms of 1441. The Council had failed to find that key and </p>
<p>unlock the possibility of further inspections. On the authorisation for force … </p>
<p>I would be circulating the view our Attorney General had given earlier that day.”</p>
<p><b>741.  Dr Blix told the Council that the UNMOVIC draft programme identifying key </b></p>
<p><b>tasks would be available that afternoon, and that with a pro-active attitude it would </b></p>
<p><b>take Iraq “months” to complete.</b></p>
<p><b>742. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix had told the Council that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s draft work programme would be available that afternoon. </p>
<p>It identified 12 key tasks. With a pro-active Iraqi attitude, all disarmament </p>
<p>tasks would take months to complete.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had set out a smaller group of tasks and UNMOVIC would accept a time </p>
<p>set down by the Council and then report for it to judge compliance. Some issues </p>
<p>would take little time with Iraqi co-operation (eg interviews, missile destruction </p>
<p>and UAVs). But others – anthrax and mobile labs – were more difficult: it would </p>
<p>not take long to present materials if they existed, but it could take longer to prove </p>
<p>their non-existence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While there had been pro-active Iraqi co-operation in recent days (including </p>
<p>further efforts to convince UNMOVIC that anthrax/VX had been destroyed and </p>
<p>footage of mobile sites), Dr Blix could not offer conclusions until he had a view </p>
<p>from his experts.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not clear whether the pro-active Iraqi co-operation covered all areas.</p>

<p><b>743.  Mr Annan announced the withdrawal of the inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>744. </b> Mr Annan told the Security Council that, following the US call to evacuate </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>remained. He suggested that “it would be helpful to neutralise work programme </p>
<p>arguments – e.g. by pointing to a post-conflict UNMOVIC/IAEA disarmament role”.</p>
<p><b>746. </b> In a press conference after the meeting, Mr Annan announced that he was </p>
<p>withdrawing staff from Iraq following a warning from the US authorities the previous </p>
<p>day “that it would be prudent not to leave our staff in the region”.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> Mr Annan also </p>
<p>announced that several UN mandates, such as the Oil-for-Food programme, would be </p>
<p>suspended, but the UN would “find a way of resuming our humanitarian activities” and </p>
<p>to do “whatever we can to give them [the Iraqi population] assistance and support”. </p>
<p>Regardless of how the issue was resolved, the Security Council would have a role </p>
<p>to play in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p><b>747. </b> Mr Annan stated:</p>
<p>“I have made it very clear that in my judgement if the Council were to be able to </p>
<p>manage this process successfully and most of [sic] the collective will to handle </p>
<p>this operation, its own reputation and credibility would have been enhanced. </p>
<p>And I have also said if the action is to take place without the support of the Council, </p>
<p>its legitimacy will be questioned and the support for it will be diminished.”</p>
<p><b>748. </b> In response to questions, Mr Annan stated that war was “always a catastrophe” </p>
<p>and would lead to “major human tragedy”:</p>
<p>“… nobody wanted that and this was why we had hoped that the Iraqi leadership </p>
<p>would have co-operated fully and would have been able to do this [disarm] without </p>
<p>resort to the use of force. But the little window that we seem to have seems to be </p>

<p> President Chirac’s intervention spoke </p>

<p>MR IVANOV’S STATEMENT, 17 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>754. </b> A statement issued on 17 March by Mr Ivanov said that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia had “firmly adhered” to an agreement made in a telephone call between </p>
<p>President Putin and President Bush on 6 September 2002, to “jointly seek the </p>
<p>unconditional return of inspectors to Iraq in accordance with UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions mandating Iraq’s disarmament”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia had taken “a step towards Washington” by helping to pass </p>
<p>resolution 1441 unanimously, and sought Iraq’s “full co-operation and the </p>
<p>meeting of all demands” made by UNMOVIC and the IAEA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia’s position, which was “shared by most members of the Security Council </p>
<p>and by other states, allowed the establishment of a reliable mechanism of </p>
<p>inspections that would be able to disarm Iraq”; and: “Because of this pressure </p>
<p>from the international community, disarmament is under way”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In that context, “the idea of an imminent war against Iraq does not appear to </p>
<p>be valid”. It would involve “serious risks to all nations”. “In speaking out for a </p>
<p>political solution”, Russia was “striving not only to overcome this particular crisis </p>
<p>[Iraq] but also to push for continued joint efforts to solve other international </p>
<p>problems that are no less acute”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The relationship between Russia and the US was “marked by growing mutual </p>
<p>trust and the spirit of co-operation”; including “an open and honest dialogue </p>
<p>over the most complex issues”. If Russia believed “that war against Iraq” would </p>
<p>“lead to harsh consequences”, it should “talk about it openly” with its partners </p>
<p>in Washington. Eliminating the threat of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction by </p>
<p>working with the US and other countries “and using political means” would be </p>
<p>“true partnership”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The value of partners and allies” was “not that they automatically agree with </p>
<p>one another but that they search together for solutions to solve problems in </p>

<p>common interests”. Striving for a political solution on Iraq was “in the best </p>
<p>interests” of Russia, the US and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p><b>755. </b> Separately, Sir Roderic Lyne reported that Mr Ivanov’s statement was:</p>
<p>“… claiming that Iraq ‘no longer presents a threat to international peace and </p>
<p>security’ and that ‘under these conditions, the use of force against Iraq, particularly </p>
<p>with references to the previous UNSC resolutions has absolutely no grounds, </p>
<p>including legal’.”</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>756. </b> Mr Ivanov had stressed that resolution 1441 gave “no one the right to an automatic </p>
<p>use of force” and said that Russia wanted to ensure that the Security Council retained </p>
<p>control of the situation.</p>
<p>IMPACT OF THE US MILITARY TIMETABLE</p>
<p><b>757.  The US decision on the timing of military action determined the time </b></p>
<p><b>available for diplomatic negotiations.</b></p>
<p><b>758. </b> As the evidence in this and preceding Sections of the Report shows, the timetable </p>
<p>available for diplomatic negotiations on the second resolution was determined by </p>
<p>President Bush’s decisions on the timing of military action.</p>
<p><b>759. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock identified President Bush’s decision on the timing of </p>
<p>military preparations as the main factor leading to the end of the attempt to secure </p>
<p>a second resolution.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>760. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer, the British Ambassador to Washington from 1997 </p>
<p>to February 2003, told the Inquiry that “when you looked at the timetable for the </p>
<p>inspections, it was impossible to see how Blix could bring the inspection process to </p>
<p>a conclusion for better or for worse by March”.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>761. </b> Sir Christopher added that had the effect of turning resolution 1441, which had </p>
<p>been a challenge to Saddam Hussein, “on its head”. The military timetable meant that </p>
<p>the UK found itself “scrabbling for the smoking gun” to prove that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was guilty.</p>
<p><b>762. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell told the Inquiry that, from January 2003, the UK had </p>
<p>repeatedly asked for, and been given, more time by President Bush; but by mid-March </p>
<p>“he wasn’t going to give us more time”.</p>

<p><b>763. </b> Asked whether it was the need for the Armed Forces to move which set the </p>
<p>deadline, Mr Powell replied: “Yes”.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>764. </b> Asked whether the approaches from France following President Chirac’s </p>
<p>remarks had made clear that it was not closed to the idea of continuing the inspections </p>
<p>negotiation and, if this led to a particular result, voting for a resolution further down the </p>
<p>track, Sir Jeremy Greenstock replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s probably true. But we knew by 10 March, because we had been talking </p>
<p>with the Americans all along about how much time we had for the benchmarks, that </p>
<p>we didn’t have time for that sort of escape route from what Chirac said.”</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>765. </b> Asked about Mr Annan’s report on 12 March that President Chirac was not closed </p>
<p>to compromise, Sir Jeremy stated: “The Americans were closed to compromise.”</p>
<p><b>766. </b> Sir John Holmes told the Inquiry that the dialogue with France about a second </p>
<p>resolution had continued after President Chirac’s statement:</p>
<p>“… but … it was becoming increasingly clear that this was a game without meaning </p>
<p>at that point, because the military timetable was so close to fruition …”</p>

<p><b>767.  If the matter had been left to the Security Council to decide, military action </b></p>
<p><b>might have been postponed.</b></p>
<p><b>768. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock said that, “[I]t would have </p>
<p>been in our interests to give the inspectors more time to find a smoking gun”, and </p>
<p>that the second resolution might have taken on a different shape or character on </p>
<p>a different timing.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p><b>769. </b> Sir Jeremy thought it was “more than a 50 per cent chance that, if we had waited </p>
<p>until October, the inspectors would not have found a satisfactory solution and that </p>
<p>military force might well have been used at that point, the difference being the legitimacy </p>
<p>involved in giving the inspectors the greater time”.</p>
<p><b>770. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he believed “letting the inspections run </p>
<p>longer … would have been a useful thing to do”. He:</p>

<p>least the suggestion that the French made that they would not approve any second </p>

<p>with the process and a determination to bring it to an end.”</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>771. </b> Asked whether the suggestion by France and others to extend the period </p>
<p>of inspections was “for real” or “purely tactical to hold off the invasion”, Sir David </p>
<p>responded:</p>
<p>“I don’t know that I can be sure … there was an element of tactics and I think it is </p>
<p>important to recall how bad political relationships were at the top among different </p>
<p>governments at this time.</p>
<p>“One of the difficulties I felt … was the lack of communication between those </p>
<p>who were on different sides of the argument and I think there was undoubtedly </p>
<p>a tactical perception …</p>
<p>“I am not sure it was entirely tactical …”</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>772. </b> Sir David Manning subsequently told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It became clear in January and February that it was very, very tough. This is a </p>
<p>period when relationships between leaders become very strained, and to a certain </p>
<p>extent just break down, to be honest.</p>
<p>“The French sort of go into overdrive against the idea of the second resolution in </p>
<p>February. The Americans tell us, well, we will get you the second resolution, we </p>
<p>know the Prime Minister needs one, and are, I think, considerably surprised when </p>
<p>they find actually they can’t deliver a second resolution.</p>
<p>“And I think the degree to which emotion and anger are affecting the argument at the </p>

<p>“So it looked pretty bleak, to be honest. On the other hand, it seemed to me tempers </p>

<p><b>776. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We never misrepresented the French view. The French view was perfectly clear. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>540</p>
<p><b>798. </b> The Government had tried its “utmost”, and had “tabled a draft … resolution, </p>
<p>amended it, and then been prepared to apply tests against which Iraq’s co-operation … </p>
<p>could be judged”. Although the UK had been “gathering increasing support from </p>
<p>members of the Security Council”, the French statement “that they would veto a </p>
<p>resolution in all circumstances had made it impossible to achieve a new … resolution”. </p>
<p>France, with Russia in support, “were not prepared to accept” that if Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>“did not comply with the United Nations obligations, military action should follow”. </p>
<p>The UK was in a situation it had “striven to avoid”: “There would be no second resolution </p>
<p>and military action was likely to be necessary … to enforce compliance by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein with Iraq’s obligations.”</p>
<p><b>799. </b> Mr Blair stated that the US “had now undertaken to produce a ‘Road Map’ for the </p>
<p>Middle East Peace Process, once the new Palestinian Prime Minister’s appointment </p>
<p>had been confirmed”. That would “open the way to a full and final settlement within </p>
<p>three years”. The US “had also confirmed” that it “would seek a UN mandate for the </p>
<p>post-conflict reconstruction of Iraq”, and: “Oil revenues would be administered under </p>
<p>the UN’s authority.”</p>
<p><b>800. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“A lot of work was needed to repair the strains which had arisen internationally over </p>
<p>the past few weeks. He regretted that the international community had sent mixed </p>
<p>messages to Saddam Hussein, whose regime could have been disarmed peacefully </p>
<p>if confronted by international solidarity. The blockage we had encountered in the </p>
<p>United Nations impeded any progress.”</p>
<p><b>801. </b> Mr Straw said that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… had persuaded President Bush … to go down the United Nations route in order </p>
<p>to achieve the maximum authority for the disarmament of Iraq, but the diplomatic </p>
<p>process was now at an end.”</p>
<p><b>802. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“Progress had been made towards forging a consensus before the French and </p>
<p>Russians had indicated their intention to veto any Security Council resolution </p>
<p>proposed which indicated that military action would follow Saddam Hussein’s failure </p>
<p>to comply. His assessment was that President Chirac of France had decided to open </p>
<p>up a strategic divide between France and the United Kingdom; the row in Brussels </p>
<p>in late 2002 had been manufactured. Effectively, one member of the Security </p>
<p>Council had torpedoed the whole process.”</p>
<p><b>803. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“… the one chance now remaining to Saddam Hussein was to seek exile. If that </p>
<p>course failed, the Government would seek the support of the House of Commons </p>

<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>541</p>
<p>for military action against Iraq. There would be a substantive motion in a debate now </p>
<p>scheduled for Tuesday [18 March].”</p>
<p><b>804. </b> Lord Goldsmith told Cabinet that he had answered a Parliamentary Question in </p>
<p>the House of Lords that day “on the authority for the use of force against Iraq”; and that </p>
<p>Mr Straw had also sent a document “on the legal basis” to the FAC.</p>
<p><b>805. </b> The minutes record that Lord Goldsmith informed Cabinet that:</p>
<p>“Authority existed from the combined effect of United Nations Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, all of which were adopted under Chapter VII of the </p>
<p>United Nations Charter. The latter allowed the use of force for the express purpose </p>
<p>of restoring international peace and security … resolution 1441 determined that </p>
<p>Iraq had been and remained in material breach of … resolution 687 and gave Iraq </p>
<p>a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations, warning of serious </p>
<p>consequences if it did not do so. It was plain that Iraq had failed so to comply and </p>
<p>therefore continued to be in material breach. The authority to use force under </p>
<p>… resolution 678 was revived as a result … [R]esolution 1441 did not contain </p>
<p>a requirement for a further … resolution to authorise the use of force.”</p>
<p><b>806. </b> The points made during discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the attitude of France “had undermined the mechanism of the United Nations </p>
<p>to enforce the will of the international community”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>with the removal of a tyrant and the new initiative on the MEPP, “a different </p>
<p>Middle East was in prospect”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“after the strenuous efforts to find a diplomatic solution”, the Government “had </p>
<p>enhanced its credibility by the integrity and consistency of its position on Iraq”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s supporters “needed a comprehensive statement to explain </p>
<p>the position”: a second resolution “had been politically desirable but not </p>
<p>legally essential”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“it was important to focus on Saddam’s failure to comply, and to avoid the </p>
<p>impression that the failure to gain a further … resolution was the issue”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>within the UK the views of all citizens had to be respected and a dialogue with </p>
<p>the Muslim community maintained, “while setting out clearly the case for military </p>
<p>action in the current circumstances”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure to disarm Iraq “risked sending a message of encouragement to dictators </p>
<p>and countries illegally holding weapons of mass destruction”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in conducting military operations, it would be important to show “we wished to </p>
<p>protect civilians, seek the surrender of Iraqi conscripts, and protect religious and </p>
<p>cultural sites”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s commitment to the UN was to make “its writ run” and to </p>
<p>encourage its members to work within that framework;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>542</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “stalemate” in the UN “should prompt a new look at the international security </p>
<p>architecture whose modernisation needed to be addressed”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as occupation forces would be “restricted” in the action they could take, there </p>
<p>was a legal necessity for a UN mandate for the reconstruction of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “real test of the Government’s credibility” would be the extent to which the </p>
<p>MEPP was driven forward “and the manner in which the Iraqi people were cared </p>
<p>for after the conflict”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government “was motivated by a world view which promoted justice, good </p>
<p>governance and pluralism and this set it apart from other governments of the </p>
<p>industrialised world”.</p>
<p><b>807. </b> Mr Prescott stated that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… had played a major role in upholding the credibility of the United Nations. </p>
<p>French intransigence had thwarted success in taking the United Nations process to </p>
<p>its logical conclusion. Nevertheless, the use of force against Iraq was authorised by </p>
<p>existing … resolutions.”</p>
<p><b>808. </b> Mr Blair concluded that:</p>
<p>“… the diplomatic process was now at an end. Saddam Hussein would be given </p>
<p>an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the House of Commons would be asked to endorse </p>
<p>the use of military action against Iraq to enforce compliance, if necessary.”</p>
<p><b>809. </b> Cabinet: “Took note.”</p>
<p><b>810. </b> Mr Cook’s decision to resign from the Government was announced during Cabinet, </p>
<p>which he did not attend.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p><b>811.  Cabinet was provided with the text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to </b></p>
<p><b>Baroness Ramsey setting out the legal basis for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>812.  That document represented a statement of the Government’s legal position – </b></p>
<p><b>it did not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take </b></p>
<p><b>“the final opportunity” to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>813.  Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as Lord </b></p>
<p><b>Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March had done, the conflicting arguments regarding </b></p>
<p><b>the legal effect of resolution 1441 and whether, in particular, it authorised military </b></p>
<p><b>action without a further resolution of the Security Council.</b></p>

<p><b>814.  Cabinet was not provided with, or informed of, Mr Brummell’s letter to </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Rycroft of 14 March; or Mr Rycroft’s response of 15 March. Cabinet was not </b></p>
<p><b>told how Mr Blair had reached the view recorded in Mr Rycroft’s letter.</b></p>
<p><b>815.  The consideration of the legal basis for military action and the evidence from </b></p>
<p><b>those present on the discussion of the legal issues in Cabinet is addressed in </b></p>
<p><b>Section 5.</b></p>
<p><b>816.  The majority of Cabinet members who gave evidence to the Inquiry took </b></p>
<p><b>the position that the role of the Attorney General on 17 March was, simply, to tell </b></p>
<p><b>Cabinet whether or not there was a legal basis for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>817.  None of those Ministers who had read Lord Goldsmith’s 7 March advice </b></p>
<p><b>asked for an explanation as to why his legal view of resolution 1441 had changed.</b></p>
<p><b>818.  There was little appetite to question Lord Goldsmith about his advice, and </b></p>
<p><b>no substantive discussion of the legal issues was recorded.</b></p>
<p><b>819.  Cabinet was, however, being asked to confirm the decision that the </b></p>
<p><b>diplomatic process was at an end and that the House of Commons should </b></p>
<p><b>be asked to endorse the use of military action to enforce Iraq’s compliance. </b></p>
<p><b>Given the gravity of this decision, Cabinet should have been made aware of </b></p>
<p><b>the legal uncertainties.</b></p>
<p><b>820.  Lord Goldsmith should have been asked to provide written advice which </b></p>
<p><b>fully reflected the position on 17 March, explained the legal basis on which the </b></p>
<p><b>UK could take military action, and set out the risks of legal challenge.</b></p>
<p><b>821.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued to attribute the primary responsibility for </b></p>
<p><b>the failure to secure support in the Security Council to France’s statements that </b></p>
<p><b>it would veto a resolution setting an ultimatum for Iraq to demonstrate that it was </b></p>
<p><b>co-operating as required by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>822.  As the evidence in this Section shows, the Security Council was deeply </b></p>
<p><b>divided and China, France and Russia, and others, took the view that options </b></p>
<p><b>other than the use of military force had not yet been exhausted.</b></p>
<p><b>823. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had told Cabinet that “an impasse </p>
<p>was an impasse” and that the “French block” was “not conditional but absolute”.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>824. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“Apart from Clare Short, the Cabinet were supportive. All my most loyal people </p>
<p>weighed in. As ever on these occasions, John Prescott was a rock. Derry Irvine </p>
<p>[Lord Irvine of Lairg, the Lord Chancellor] came in with a very helpful intervention </p>

<p>so hard to get a second resolution that people assumed, wrongly, that we needed </p>
<p>one legally.”</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>825. </b> In his memoir, Mr Prescott wrote that:</p>
<p>“Apart from Clare and Robin, everyone understood and accepted what was </p>
<p>happening. Although we all had worries, we tended to go along with the feeling that </p>
<p>we were stuck with Bush. Tony couldn’t walk away. We were blaming the French, </p>
<p>for backing out of supporting an invasion, but we knew the Americans would go in </p>
<p>whatever happened, so the French didn’t really matter.</p>
<p>“Our relationship with the US had always been fundamental. All British prime </p>
<p>ministers have to decide whether we’re with the US or not. And Tony had decided </p>
<p>we were. Most of us agreed with that, deep down. During the run-up to the invasion, </p>
<p>we all had our own reservations, and we were genuinely trying to delay an actual </p>
<p>invasion, and go the UN route, if not stop it altogether, for as long as possible. </p>
<p>But once it was inevitable we felt that was it.</p>
<p>“My attitude was that Tony, having made up his mind, should be supported. I took </p>
<p>one of the Cabinet meetings on Iraq and got quite carried away, saying it was vital </p>
<p>to stick together. We should do the brave thing, not be cowards.”</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>826. </b> Lord Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that he had been “governed by a desire” that he sensed was shared with colleagues that </p>
<p>“military action should be a last resort” and that it was not until Cabinet on 17 March:</p>
<p>“… when it was clear that all other options had been exhausted and where we </p>
<p>had the benefit of legal opinion … that I formed the firm view that it was now </p>
<p>inevitable.”</p>

<p><b>829.  Mr Straw stated that Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer “set out the legal </b></p>
<p><b>basis for the use of force”.</b></p>
<p><b>830.  Mr Straw drew attention to the significance of the fact that no one “in </b></p>
<p><b>discussions in the Security Council and outside” had claimed that Iraq was in </b></p>
<p><b>full compliance with its obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>831. </b> Mr Straw made a statement to the House of Commons at 8.24pm.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>832. </b> Referring to the statement issued at the Azores Summit calling on all members </p>
<p>of the Security Council to adopt a resolution challenging Saddam Hussein to take </p>
<p>a strategic decision to disarm, Mr Straw told the House of Commons:</p>
<p>“Such a resolution has never been needed legally, but we have long had </p>
<p>a preference for it politically.”</p>
<p><b>833. </b> Mr Straw stated that there had been “intense diplomatic activity to secure that </p>
<p>end over many months, culminating in the last 24 hours”. Despite “final efforts” by Sir </p>
<p>Jeremy Greenstock the previous evening and his own conversations with his “Spanish, </p>
<p>American, Russian and Chinese counterparts that morning”, the Government had:</p>
<p>“… reluctantly concluded that a Security Council consensus on a new resolution </p>
<p>would not be possible. On my instructions, Sir Jeremy Greenstock made a public </p>
<p>announcement to that effect at the United Nations at about 3.15pm UK time today.”</p>
<p><b>834. </b> Mr Straw continued that, since the adoption of resolution 1441 in November </p>
<p>2002, he, Mr Blair and Sir Jeremy Greenstock had “strained every nerve” in search of </p>
<p>a consensus “which could finally persuade Iraq by peaceful means, to provide the full </p>
<p>and immediate co-operation demanded by the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>835. </b> Mr Straw stated that it was significant that “in all the discussions in the Security </p>
<p>Council and outside” no-one had claimed that Iraq was “in full compliance with the </p>
<p>obligations placed on it”; and:</p>
<p>“Given that, it was my belief, up to about a week ago, that we were close to </p>
<p>achieving a consensus that we sought on the further resolution. Sadly, one country </p>
<p>then ensured that the Security Council could not act. President Chirac’s unequivocal </p>
<p>announcement last Monday that France would veto a second resolution containing </p>
<p>that or any ultimatum ‘whatever the circumstances’ inevitably created a sense of </p>
<p>paralysis in our negotiations. I deeply regret that France has thereby put a Security </p>
<p>Council consensus beyond reach.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>546</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Mr Straw told the House of Commons that the proposals submitted by France, </p>
<p>Germany and Russia for “more time and more inspections” sought to “rewrite” resolution </p>
<p>1441. They “would have allowed Saddam to continue stringing out inspections </p>
<p>indefinitely, and he would rightly have drawn the lesson that the Security Council was </p>
<p>simply not prepared to enforce the ultimatum … at the heart of resolution 1441”.</p>
<p><b>837. </b> Mr Straw pointed out that “in the event of non-compliance” Iraq should, as OP13 </p>
<p>of resolution 1441 spelled out, expect “serious consequences”. Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“As a result of Saddam Hussein’s persistent refusal to meet the UN’s demands, </p>
<p>and the inability of the Security Council to adopt a further resolution, the Cabinet </p>
<p>has decided to ask the House to support the United Kingdom’s participation in </p>
<p>military operations, should they be necessary, with the objective of ensuring the </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, and thereby the maintenance </p>
<p>of the authority of the United Nations.”</p>
<p><b>838. </b> Mr Straw confirmed that Parliament “would have an opportunity to debate our </p>
<p>involvement in military action prior to hostilities” the following day; and that the debate </p>
<p>would be on a substantive motion “proposed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet </p>
<p>colleagues”. He also drew the attention of the House to Lord Goldsmith’s Written </p>
<p>Answer, which “set out the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq” and the </p>
<p>documents provided earlier that day.</p>
<p><b>839. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“Some say that Iraq can be disarmed without an ultimatum, without the threat or the </p>
<p>use of force, but simply by more time and more inspections. That approach is defied </p>
<p>by all our experience over 12 weary years. It cannot produce the disarmament of </p>
<p>Iraq; it cannot rid the world of the danger of the Iraq regime. It can only bring comfort </p>
<p>to tyrants and emasculate the authority of the United Nations …”</p>
<p><b>840. </b> Mr Ancram responded that diplomacy was “at an end” and there was the “grim </p>
<p>prospect of war … because Saddam Hussein has contemptuously failed to take the final </p>
<p>opportunity … offered him”. There had been “a chance that a clear, unequivocal and </p>
<p>united voice from the international community might … have persuaded him to disarm </p>
<p>or to go. France put paid to that. I hope that in Paris they will reflect tonight on what they </p>
<p>have achieved.”</p>
<p>293</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Mr Ancram stated: “Saddam Hussein, in possession of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, is a threat to international peace and security… including ourselves. </p>
<p>That is why we believe that action to disarm him can no longer be delayed.”</p>

<p><b>842. </b> Mr Ancram concluded:</p>
<p>“Our thoughts tonight must be with our Armed Forces … they have our unqualified </p>
<p>support. We will offer the Government our support in the decisions that must now be </p>
<p>made. We will do so because they have reached the same conclusions as us on the </p>
<p>threat posed by Saddam Hussein and the legality of taking action. We believe they </p>
<p>are acting in the national interest and as long as that is the case we will continue to </p>
<p>support them. Her Majesty’s Opposition will do what in our hearts we know for our </p>
<p>country to be right.”</p>
<p><b>843. </b> In response to a question from Mr Moore about the implications of taking action </p>
<p>without the backing of the Security Council and allowing inspections to continue, </p>
<p>Mr Straw agreed that it would have been better to achieve a consensus in the UN. </p>
<p>He also stated that France and Russia had agreed the process in resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… if Iraq was in further material breach, which it has been for weeks, setting out </p>
<p>further discussions in the Security Council, which have already taken place; and … </p>
<p>if Iraq failed to comply, serious consequences would follow.”</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>844. </b> The provisions required by resolution 1441 were examined in depth by Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith in his advice of 7 March, which is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>845. </b> Asked about his statement to the House of Commons on 17 March that it was his </p>
<p>“belief, up to about a week ago, that we were close to achieving a consensus that we </p>
<p>sought on the further resolution”, Mr Straw told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“My point … was accurate. I didn’t say we had a consensus. I said we were close </p>
<p>to it.”</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>846. </b> Mr Straw’s statement was repeated in the House of Lords by Baroness Symons of </p>
<p>Vernham Dean, the joint FCO/Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Minister for Trade </p>
<p>and Investment.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>847. </b> In reply to the points made in response to her statement, Baroness Symons made </p>
<p>a number of comments, including:</p>
<p>“… I believe that the legality of the position is indeed settled. I do not think we have </p>
<p>ever had such a clear statement from the Attorney General at a juncture like this.”</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>848. </b> Subsequently, Baroness Symons stated that the Government “had gone further </p>
<p>than any Government” to put the “advice” into the public arena, and that Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>had “given a clear statement of his opinion”.</p>

<p><b>849. </b> Baroness Symons’ statement took place during a debate on the legality of the </p>
<p>use of armed force. In closing the debate, Baroness Symons again stated that Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith had published his “advice”.</p>

<p><b>850. </b> As Section 5 explains, the Written Answer was not Lord Goldsmith’s advice or </p>

<p><b>House of Lords debate on the legality </b></p>
<p><b>of the use of armed force, 17 March 2003</b></p>
<p>The House of Lords debated the legality of the use of armed force on the evening of </p>
<p>17 March.</p>
<p>Opening the debate, Lord Goodhart (Liberal Democrat) set out his view of the legality of </p>
<p>the use of force in Iraq without the specific authority of a further resolution of the Security </p>
<p>Council. Commenting on the summary of Lord Goldsmith’s legal advice to the Government </p>
<p>he stated:</p>
<p>“… we should have liked to see much more detail of what must have been a lengthy </p>
<p>opinion … All we have seen is the baldly stated summary. We also regret that the </p>
<p>… Attorney General has not given us the opportunity to ask questions and to hear </p>
<p>his answers.</p>
<p>“The Attorney General’s opinion reaches a highly questionable conclusion, which </p>
<p>is based on a dubious interpretation of deliberately ambiguous wording.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Both the United States and British Ambassadors to the United Nations when </p>
<p>resolution 1441 was adopted said that it contained no automaticity. I believe that </p>
<p>there was a clear understanding that resolution 1441 did not confer a right of action </p>
<p>without referring back to the Security Council. Unless there had been such an </p>
<p>understanding, it would have been difficult if not impossible to get resolution 1441 </p>
<p>through the Security Council.</p>
<p>“A final decision on the use of armed force requires judgement as to the seriousness </p>
<p>of the breaches by Iraq, the effectiveness of the inspection system and whether the </p>
<p>breaches could be corrected by means short of war. Those are difficult decisions. </p>
<p>The Attorney General is arguing that the Security Council has delegated those </p>
<p>decisions to the United Kingdom and the United States of America – in effect, to the </p>
<p>US alone. I do not believe that that is the kind of decision that the Security Council </p>
<p>could, or would, delegate to any one member, however powerful. A decision to use </p>
<p>armed force under Article 42 in full scale war is the most solemn decision that the </p>
<p>Security Council can ever take. The idea that vague and ambiguous words in those </p>

<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>549</p>
<p>resolutions can be read as implying a delegation to the United States, with or without </p>
<p>the United Kingdom, to take these decisions verges on the absurd.”</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>A range of views was expressed by speakers during the ensuing debate.</p>
<p>Lord Mayhew (Conservative) described the United Nations as “a relatively new </p>
<p>jurisdiction”.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> The world was far from having “an article or precedent” for every situation </p>
<p>it faced. As a result, there would often be arguments “which it would take years to litigate </p>
<p>in any international court to an authoritative conclusion”. He concluded that UN member </p>
<p>states “must sometimes have the courage to act when the law may not be explicitly cut </p>
<p>and dried and to bear the heavy duty themselves for doing what they conscientiously </p>
<p>believe to be necessary and lawful.”</p>
<p>Lord Mayhew stated that, because the cease-fire established under resolution 687 was </p>
<p>conditional, it had left resolution 678 undischarged: “in force, but … placed in abeyance </p>
<p>or suspension provided Iraq fulfilled its obligations and continued to fulfil the conditions”. </p>
<p>Because Iraq had never complied with those conditions, resolution 678 was no longer </p>
<p>in abeyance, but available. Those who refused to agree a further resolution were </p>
<p>entitled to make that choice, but it could not have the effect of a veto on the operation </p>
<p>of resolution 678.</p>
<p>Lord Hannay, a former UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations, stated that </p>
<p>resolution 1441 had not, on its own, provided authority for the use of force in the event </p>
<p>of non-compliance because it had not needed to.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> The authority already existed in </p>
<p>resolution 687. That there had been Iraqi non-compliance since resolution 687 was “surely </p>
<p>not seriously in doubt”. That there had been some limited compliance was not the point. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Security Council had “fallen prey to divided counsels”. The purpose of </p>
<p>the draft second resolution had been political, not legal: “to draw a line under the phase </p>
<p>on non-compliance with Security Council resolution 1441 and to signal that serious </p>
<p>consequences were now imminent.”</p>
<p>Lord Hannay concluded that military action by the UK, the US and other allies:</p>
<p>“… does not herald either a new doctrine bypassing the system laid down in the UN </p>
<p>Charter, nor the flouting of international law. In fact, it is far less daring than was the </p>
<p>decision by NATO to use force against Yugoslavia in the case of Kosovo …”</p>
<p>Lord Howell (Conservative) stated that the question of legality “ought to have been settled </p>
<p>long before we reached the point at which the troops are going into action”.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> There was </p>
<p>“no doubt” that the case for intervention had been “poorly put forward”, adding greatly </p>
<p>to tensions.</p>
<p>Lord Lloyd of Berwick, a former Law Lord, stated that he found it “impossible as presently </p>
<p>advised” to accept the argument offered by Lord Goldsmith in his Written Answer to </p>
<p>Baroness Ramsey.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>550</p>
<p>Responding to points raised during the debate, Baroness Symons set out the </p>
<p>Government’s position, including by reference to previous occasions since 1991 when </p>
<p>force had been used in Iraq.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> She stated that resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… provided for any failure by Iraq to be ‘considered’ by the Security Council under </p>
<p>paragraph 12. That consideration has taken place regularly since the adoption of </p>
<p>resolution 1441. It is plain from UNMOVIC statements … that Iraq has not complied, </p>
<p>as required, with its disarmament obligations. Whatever other differences there </p>
<p>may be on the Security Council, no member of the Council has questioned that </p>
<p>conclusion. It follows that Iraq has not taken the final opportunity offered and remains </p>
<p>in material breach …”</p>
<p>MR COOK’S RESIGNATION STATEMENT, 17 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>852.  In a statement later that evening, Mr Cook set out his doubts about the </b></p>
<p><b>degree to which Saddam Hussein posed a “clear and present danger” and his </b></p>
<p><b>concerns that the UK was being “pushed too quickly into conflict” by the US </b></p>
<p><b>without the support of the UN and in the face of hostility from many of the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>traditional allies.</b></p>
<p><b>853. </b> Mr Cook set out the reasons why he could not “support a war without international </p>
<p>agreement or domestic support” and why, in order to vote against military action in the </p>
<p>House of Commons the following day, he had resigned from the Government.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>854. </b> Mr Cook applauded the “heroic efforts” of Mr Blair and those of Mr Straw in seeking </p>
<p>to secure a second resolution, but pointed out:</p>
<p>“… the very intensity of those attempts underlines how important it was to succeed. </p>
<p>Now that those attempts have failed, we cannot pretend that getting a second </p>
<p>resolution was of no importance.</p>
<p>“France has been at the receiving end of bucket-loads of commentary in recent </p>
<p>days. It is not France alone that wants more time for inspections … We delude </p>
<p>ourselves if we think that the degree of international hostility is all the result </p>
<p>of President Chirac. The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on </p>
<p>a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are </p>
<p>a leading partner …</p>
<p>“To end up in such diplomatic weakness is a serious reverse. Only a year ago, we </p>
<p>and the United States were part of a coalition against terrorism that was wider and </p>
<p>more diverse than I would ever have imagined possible. History will be astonished at </p>
<p>the diplomatic miscalculations that led so quickly to the disintegration of that powerful </p>
<p>coalition. The US can afford to go it alone … Our interests are best protected not by </p>

<p>unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world governed by rules. Yet </p>
<p>tonight the international partnerships most important to us are weakened … Those </p>
<p>are heavy casualties in a war in which a shot has yet to be fired.”</p>
<p><b>855. </b> Dismissing any parallels with the action in Kosovo in 1999, where there had been </p>
<p>multilateral support and the need to respond to an urgent and compelling humanitarian </p>
<p>crisis, Mr Cook stated:</p>
<p>“Our difficulty in getting support this time is that neither the international community </p>
<p>nor the British public is persuaded that there is an urgent and compelling reason for </p>
<p>this military action in Iraq.</p>
<p>“The threshold for war should always be high. None of us can predict the death toll </p>
<p>of civilians …”</p>
<p><b>856. </b> Mr Cook continued:</p>
<p>“Nor is it fair to accuse those of us who want longer for inspections of not having </p>
<p>an alternative strategy … Over the past decade that strategy [of containment] had </p>
<p>destroyed more weapons than in the Gulf War, dismantled Iraq’s nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme and halted Saddam’s medium and long range missile programmes.”</p>
<p>Iraq’s military strength was now less than half its size in 1991; and, “Ironically” it was </p>
<p>“only because Iraq’s military forces” were “so weak that we can even contemplate </p>
<p>its invasion”.</p>
<p><b>857. </b> Mr Cook questioned the threat posed by Iraq:</p>
<p>“Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood </p>
<p>sense of the term – namely a credible device capable of being delivered against </p>
<p>a strategic city target. It probably … has biological toxins and battlefield chemical </p>
<p>munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold Saddam </p>
<p>anthrax agents and the then British government approved chemical and munitions </p>
<p>factories. Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a </p>
<p>military capacity that has been there for twenty years, and which we helped to </p>
<p>create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while Saddam’s ambition to </p>
<p>complete his weapons programme is blocked by the presence of UN inspectors?”</p>
<p><b>858. </b> Drawing attention to the lack of action in the face of Israel’s refusal to comply with </p>
<p>resolution 242 (1967) demanding its withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, Mr Cook </p>
<p>warned of the “strong sense of injustice throughout the Muslim world” as a result of the </p>
<p>perception that there was “one rule for the allies of the US and another rule for the rest”. </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“Nor is our credibility helped by the appearance that our partners in Washington </p>
<p>are less interested in disarmament than they are in regime change in Iraq. That </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>552</p>
<p>explains why any evidence that inspections may be showing progress is greeted in </p>
<p>Washington not with satisfaction but with consternation: it reduces the case for war.”</p>
<p><b>859. </b> Mr Cook concluded that the British people:</p>
<p>“… do not doubt that Saddam is a brutal dictator, but they are not persuaded that </p>
<p>he is a clear and present danger to Britain. They want inspections to be given a </p>
<p>chance, and they suspect that they are being pushed too quickly into conflict by a </p>
<p>US Administration with an agenda of its own. Above all they are uneasy at Britain </p>
<p>going out on a limb on a military adventure without a broader international coalition </p>
<p>and against the hostility of many of our traditional allies.”</p>
<p><b>860. </b> Mr Cook’s account of his view of the September dossier and the briefing he was </p>
<p>given in February 2003 by Mr Scarlett are addressed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.</p>

<p>“Firstly, the Attorney General has made clear that military action would be legal under </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>“Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States Congress voted </p>
<p>overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against Iraq. America tried to </p>
<p>work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve </p>
<p>this issue peacefully. We believe in the mission of the United Nations. One reason </p>
<p>the UN was founded … was to confront aggressive dictators, actively and early …</p>
<p>“In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act, in the early 1990s. Under </p>
<p>resolutions 678 and 687 – both still in effect – the United States and our allies are </p>
<p>authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. This is not </p>
<p>a question of authority, it is a question of will.”</p>
<p><b>868. </b> President Bush continued that he had “urged the nations of the world to unite </p>
<p>and bring an end to this danger” and the Security Council had unanimously passed </p>
<p>resolution 1441. But:</p>
<p>“… no nation could possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed. And it will not disarm </p>
<p>as long as Saddam holds power as required … some permanent members of the </p>
<p>Security Council have publicly announced that they will veto any resolution that </p>
<p>compels the disarmament of Iraq. These governments share our assessment of </p>
<p>the danger, but not our resolve to meet it. Many nations … do have the resolve and </p>
<p>fortitude to act against this threat to peace … The United Nations Security Council </p>
<p>has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours.”</p>
<p><b>869. </b> Issuing the ultimatum, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part. </p>
<p>They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave </p>
<p>Iraq, so that disarmament can proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused. All </p>
<p>the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end. Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result </p>
<p>in military conflict …”</p>
<p><b>870. </b> In a message to Iraqis, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men </p>
<p>who rule your country and not against you … The day of your liberation is near.</p>
<p>“… It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country </p>
<p>by permitting the peaceful entry of Coalition forces to eliminate weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction …”</p>
<p><b>871. </b> President Bush explicitly warned all Iraqis against destroying oil wells or using </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction: “War crimes will be prosecuted. War criminals will </p>
<p>be punished.”</p>

<p><b>872. </b> President Bush acknowledged that military action could expose the US and its </p>
<p>allies to an increased possibility of attack and that additional security measures had </p>
<p>been put in place. He concluded:</p>
<p>“We are now acting because the risk of inaction would be greater … Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when </p>
<p>they are strongest. We choose to meet that threat now …</p>
<p>“… a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never before seen </p>
<p>on this earth.</p>
<p>“… responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense, </p>
<p>it is suicide. The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now.</p>
<p>“As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest </p>
<p>commitments of our country. Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people </p>
<p>are deserving and capable of human liberty. And when the dictator has departed, </p>
<p>they can set an example to all the Middle East of a vital and peaceful and </p>
<p>self-governing nation.</p>
<p>“The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty and peace </p>
<p>in that region. Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time. </p>
<p>The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land. And the </p>
<p>greatest power of freedom is to overcome hatred and violence and turn … to the </p>
<p>pursuits of peace.</p>
<p>“That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our people by </p>
<p>uniting against the violent. And tonight, as we have done before, America and our </p>
<p>allies accept that responsibility.”</p>
<p><b>873. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that President Bush “looked nervous but </p>
<p>the message was uncompromising. Only a complete climb down by Saddam can now </p>
<p>prevent war.”</p>
<p>311</p>
<p><b>874. </b> A later telegram reported that a White House spokesman had “amplified” the </p>
<p>President’s statement and said that, if Saddam Hussein were to comply with the </p>
<p>deadline and go into exile, US troops would still enter Iraq in order to pursue and disarm </p>
<p>WMD; and that he hoped the international community would consider prosecuting </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein for war crimes even in the case of exile.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>875. </b> The Embassy also reported that “some 66 percent of Americans told Gallup that </p>

<p>PRESIDENT CHIRAC’S STATEMENT</p>
<p><b>883.  President Chirac maintained his position that the UN route had not been </b></p>
<p><b>exhausted and the Security Council should explicitly authorise the use of force. </b></p>
<p><b>The US was taking unilateral action against the will of the international community.</b></p>
<p><b>884. </b> Sir John Holmes reported on 17 March that France was taking UK “criticism on the </p>
<p>chin for the moment”, and was saying that it would be ready to help in the post-conflict </p>
<p>period, “but the greater the UN role, the easier it will be for them”.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> Senior advisers to </p>
<p>Mr de Villepin and Mr Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the French Prime Minister, understood the </p>
<p>UK position but had “made clear that they regretted nothing, and believed that they had </p>
<p>acted perfectly consistently throughout”. Mr de Villepin’s “clear view was that France </p>
<p>should not stoop to respond to our criticism, but the Elysée were less calm”.</p>
<p><b>885. </b> Sir John concluded:</p>
<p>“The French shifted a little as we approached the wire. Villepin’s acceptance of our </p>
<p>six tests when he spoke to you [Straw] … was particularly interesting, given his </p>
<p>previous sharp public rejection. But all this was far too little, far too late: positioning </p>
<p>rather than a genuine effort at agreement. The French know they are now cast as </p>
<p>scapegoats but, at least for the time being, seem to be determined to maintain a </p>
<p>dignified silence, on the assumption that once war begins we will all have an interest </p>
<p>in coming together at the UN to handle the aftermath.”</p>
<p><b>886. </b> The Elysée issued a statement early on 18 March stating that the US ultimatum </p>
<p>was a unilateral decision going against the will of the international community who </p>
<p>wanted to pursue Iraqi disarmament in accordance with resolution 1441.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“… only the Security Council is authorised to legitimise the use of force. France </p>
<p>appeals to the responsibility of all to see that international legality is respected. </p>
<p>To disregard the legitimacy of the UN, to favour force over the law, would be to take </p>
<p>on a heavy responsibility.”</p>
<p><b>887. </b> President Chirac issued a recorded speech later that morning which reiterated that </p>
<p>statement and made a number of other comments, including:</p>
<p>“France’s action has been inspired by the primacy of international law …</p>
<p>“… France considers the use of force is a last resort when all other options </p>
<p>have been exhausted. France’s stance is shared by the great majority of the </p>
<p>international community.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>558</p>
<p>“The latest discussions clearly showed that the Security Council was not disposed </p>
<p>in the current circumstances to sanction a rush to war.</p>
<p>“The United States has just given Iraq an ultimatum. Whether it is a question … of </p>
<p>the necessary disarming of Iraq or the desirable change of regime in that country, </p>
<p>there is no justification here for a unilateral decision to resort to war.</p>
<p>“However events develop in the near future, this ultimatum calls into question the </p>
<p>notion we have of international relations. It commits the future of a people, the future </p>
<p>of a region, and the stability of the world.</p>
<p>“It is a grave decision at a time when the disarmament of Iraq is under way and the </p>
<p>inspections have proved they were a credible alternative for disarming that country.</p>
<p>“It is also a decision which compromises – for the future – the methods of peacefully </p>
<p>resolving crises linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq does </p>
<p>not today represent an immediate threat such as to justify an immediate war.”</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>888. </b> Sir John Holmes commented that President Chirac’s statement continued to </p>
<p>emphasise France’s position “as on the side of the majority”, but that his description </p>
<p>of regime change as “desirable” might be “significant”.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> President Chirac “could have </p>
<p>been more categorical on the legal authority and used the language of condemnation”. </p>
<p>Sir John concluded that President Chirac had “kept his options open for co-operation </p>
<p>over the day after”.</p>
<p><b>889. </b> Reporting after the start of the conflict, Sir John Holmes offered the view that </p>
<p>President Chirac had consistently disagreed with UK policy on Iraq on sanctions and </p>
<p>military action.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p> French policy had been driven by his personal convictions. President </p>
<p>Chirac had never believed that Saddam Hussein was “really a danger to us” and France </p>
<p>had disagreed with UK policy on sanctions and military action. France had:</p>
<p>“… only ever agreed with great reluctance to each step to ratchet up the pressure </p>
<p>on Saddam while accepting that only our military pressure had made him [Saddam] </p>
<p>co-operate … [T]hey believe they have been consistent and that their opposition to </p>
<p>the use of force will in the end be vindicated.”</p>
<p><b>890. </b> Sir John wrote that it was hard to be sure of the exact moment when France </p>
<p>resolved to take on some of their closest allies and veto action if necessary. The </p>
<p>“present hard line was inherent in the Franco-German position in late January” but </p>
<p>Sir John’s view was that President Chirac had begun to see the attractions of a veto </p>
<p>during February and his confidence in a Russian veto increased after Mr Ivanov’s visit </p>
<p>to Paris on 5 March. The crucial element had been the realisation shortly after that </p>

<p>to do what he had consistently refused to do under coercion”. Mr Blair also stated:</p>
<p>“We are asked now seriously to accept that in the last few years – contrary to all </p>
<p>history, contrary to all intelligence – Saddam decided unilaterally to destroy those </p>
<p>weapons. I say that such a claim is palpably absurd.”</p>
<p><b>901. </b> Resolution 1441 required “full, unconditional and immediate compliance”. The first </p>
<p>step was a full and final declaration of all Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated that he would not address the events that had taken place since the declaration </p>
<p>“as the House is familiar with them”, but “all members” of the Security Council “accepted” </p>
<p>that the Iraq declaration (of 7 December 2002) was false. That was:</p>
<p>“… in itself … a material breach. Iraq has taken some steps in co-operation but no </p>
<p>one disputes that it is not fully co-operating. Iraq continues to deny that it has any </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, although no serious intelligence service anywhere </p>
<p>in the world believes it.”</p>
<p><b>902. </b> Mr Blair cited the UNMOVIC “clusters” document issued on 7 March as “a </p>
<p>remarkable document”, detailing “all the unanswered questions about Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction”, listing “29 different areas in which the inspectors have been unable </p>
<p>to obtain information”.</p>
<p><b>903. </b> Describing the activity in the Security Council since 7 March, Mr Blair argued </p>
<p>that, “had we meant what we said in resolution 1441”, the Security Council should </p>
<p>have convened when UNMOVIC published the “clusters” document on 7 March, and </p>
<p>“condemned Iraq as in material breach”. Saddam Hussein was “playing the same old </p>
<p>games in the same old way”. There were “minor concessions”, but there had been </p>
<p>“no fundamental change of heart or mind”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>562</p>
<p><b>904. </b> Referring to the draft resolution tabled by the UK, US and France on 7 March, </p>
<p>Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“… we could have asked for the second resolution then and there, because it was </p>
<p>justified. Instead, we laid down an ultimatum calling on Saddam to come into line </p>
<p>with resolution 1441, or be in material breach.”</p>
<p><b>905. </b> That was “not an unreasonable proposition, but still countries hesitated”, asking </p>
<p>how full co-operation would be judged. The UK had “worked on a further compromise”, </p>
<p>consulting the inspectors to draw up “five tests, based on” the “clusters” document. </p>
<p>The inspectors had “added another test: that Saddam should publicly call on the Iraqis </p>
<p>to co-operate with them”. Saddam would have been given a specified time to fulfil all six </p>
<p>tests to show full co-operation. If he did so, “the inspectors could then set out a forward </p>
<p>work programme that would extend over a period of time to make sure that disarmament </p>
<p>happened”. If, however, Saddam had failed to meet the tests, “action would follow”.</p>
<p><b>906. </b> Mr Blair told the House of Commons that:</p>
<p>“Last Monday [10 March], we were getting very close … We very nearly had the </p>
<p>majority agreement …</p>
<p>“… there were debates about the length of the ultimatum, but the basic construct </p>
<p>was gathering support. Then … France said it would veto a second resolution </p>
<p>whatever the circumstances. Then France denounced the six tests. Later that day, </p>
<p>Iraq rejected them. Still we continued to negotiate …</p>
<p>“Last Friday, France said it could not accept any resolution with an ultimatum in </p>
<p>it. On Monday [17 March], we made final efforts to secure agreement. However, </p>
<p>the fact is that France remains utterly opposed to anything which lays down an </p>
<p>ultimatum authorising action in the event of non-compliance by Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>907. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“Those on the Security Council opposed to us say that they want Saddam to disarm </p>
<p>but they will not countenance any new resolution which authorises force in the </p>
<p>event of non-compliance. That is their position – no to any ultimatum and no to any </p>
<p>resolution that stipulates that failure to comply will lead to military action. So we must </p>
<p>demand that Saddam disarms, but relinquish any concept of a threat if he does not.”</p>
<p><b>908. </b> Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein had allowed the inspectors into Iraq after four </p>
<p>years of refusal because of:</p>
<p>“… the threat of force … It is the imminence of force. The only persuasive power to </p>
<p>which he responds is 250,000 allied troops on his doorstep. However when that fact </p>
<p>is so obvious, we are told that any resolution that authorises force in the event of </p>
<p>non-compliance will be vetoed – not just opposed, but vetoed and blocked.”</p>

<p>563</p>
<p><b>909. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“The tragedy is that had such a resolution ensued and had the UN come together </p>
<p>and united – and if other troops had gone there, not just British and American </p>
<p>troops – Saddam Hussein might have complied. But the moment we proposed the </p>
<p>benchmarks and canvassed support for an ultimatum, there was immediate recourse </p>
<p>to the language of the veto. The choice was not action now or a postponement of </p>
<p>action; the choice was action or no action at all.”</p>
<p><b>910. </b> Asked what he meant by an unreasonable veto, Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“In resolution 1441, we said that it was Saddam’s final opportunity and that he had </p>
<p>to comply. That was agreed by all members of the Security Council. What is surely </p>
<p>unreasonable is for a country to come forward now, at the very point when we might </p>
<p>reach agreement and when we are – not unreasonably – saying that he must comply </p>
<p>with the UN, after all these months … on the basis of six tests or action will follow. </p>
<p>For that country to say that it will veto such a resolution in all circumstances is what </p>
<p>I would call unreasonable.”</p>
<p><b>911. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“The tragedy is that the world has to learn the lesson all over again that weakness </p>
<p>in the face of a threat from a tyrant is the surest way not to peace but … to conflict </p>
<p>… we have been victims of our own desire to placate the implacable, to persuade </p>
<p>towards reason the utterly unreasonable, and to hope that there was some genuine </p>
<p>intent to do good in a regime whose mind is in fact evil.”</p>
<p><b>912. </b> In response to a suggestion that the diplomatic process should be continued for </p>
<p>a little longer, Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“We could have had more time if the compromise proposal that we put forward had </p>
<p>been accepted … unless the threat of action was made, it was unlikely that Saddam </p>
<p>would meet the tests.</p>
<p>“… the problem with diplomacy was that it came to an end after the position of </p>
<p>France was made public – and repeated in a private conversation – and it said it </p>
<p>would block, by veto, any resolution that contained an ultimatum … the French were </p>
<p>not prepared to change their position. I am not prepared to carry on waiting and </p>
<p>delaying, with our troops in place in difficult circumstances, when that country has </p>
<p>made it clear it has a fixed position and will not change.”</p>
<p><b>913. </b> Questioned whether it was he, not the French, Russians and Chinese, who had </p>
<p>changed position and about his statement – that the only circumstances in which he </p>
<p>would go to war without a second resolution was if the inspectors concluded that there </p>
<p>had been no more progress, which they had not; if there were a majority on the Security </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>564</p>
<p>Council, which there was not; and if there was an unreasonable veto from one country, </p>
<p>when three Permanent Members were opposed to his policy – Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… resolution 1441 … stated in terms … that if Iraq continued in material breach, </p>
<p>defined as not co-operating fully, immediately and unconditionally, serious </p>
<p>consequences would follow. All we are asking for in the second resolution is the </p>
<p>clear ultimatum that if Saddam continues to fail to co-operate, force would be used. </p>
<p>The French position is that France will vote no, whatever the circumstances. Those </p>
<p>are not my words, but those of the French President. I find it sad that at this point in </p>
<p>time he cannot support us in the position we have set out, which is the only sure way </p>
<p>to disarm Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>914. </b> Addressing the conclusion which “any tyrannical regime” might take from the </p>
<p>“world’s diplomatic dance with Saddam Hussein” over the previous 12 years, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated that such a conclusion would be:</p>
<p>“That our capacity to pass firm resolutions was only matched by our feebleness </p>
<p>in implementing them. That is why this indulgence has to stop – because it is </p>
<p>dangerous: dangerous if such regimes disbelieve us; dangerous if they think they </p>
<p>can use our weakness … and dangerous because one day they will mistake our </p>
<p>innate revulsion against war for permanent incapacity, when in fact, if pushed to the </p>
<p>limit, we will act. But when we act, after years of pretence, the action will have to be </p>
<p>harder, bigger, more total in its impact. It is true that Iraq is not the only country with </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, but … to back away from this confrontation now, and </p>
<p>future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects.</p>
<p>“… any fair observer does not really dispute that Iraq is in breach of resolution 1441 </p>
<p>or that it implies action in such circumstances. The real problem is that, underneath, </p>
<p>people dispute that Iraq is a threat, dispute the link between terrorism and weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction, and dispute, in other words, the whole basis of our assertion </p>
<p>that the two together constitute a fundamental assault on our way of life.”</p>
<p><b>915. </b> Arguing that the time had come to act, Mr Blair set out why he believed, in the </p>
<p>context of “an ever more interdependent” world where the threat was “chaos and </p>
<p>disorder”, Iraq posed a threat that was “so serious and why we must tackle it”.</p>
<p><b>916. </b> In his view, there were:</p>
<p>“… two begetters of chaos: tyrannical regimes with weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>and extreme terrorist groups who profess a perverted and false sense of Islam.”</p>
<p><b>917. </b> Mr Blair set out his concerns about:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>proliferators of nuclear equipment or expertise;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“dictatorships with highly repressive regimes” who were “desperately trying to </p>
<p>acquire” chemical, biological or “particularly, nuclear weapons capability”; some </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>565</p>
<p>of those were “a short time away from having a serviceable nuclear weapon”, </p>
<p>and that activity was increasing, not diminishing; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of terrorist groups obtaining and using weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, including a “radiological bomb”.</p>
<p><b>918. </b> Mr Blair stated that tyrannical regimes with weapons of mass destruction and </p>
<p>terrorist groups had very different motives and different origins and he accepted “fully” </p>
<p>that the association between the two was:</p>
<p>“… loose – but it is hardening. The possibility of the two coming together – of </p>
<p>terrorist groups in possession of weapons of mass destruction or even of a so-called </p>
<p>dirty radiological bomb – is now in my judgement, a real and present danger to </p>
<p>Britain and its national security.”</p>
<p><b>919. </b> Addressing the effects of chemical and biological agents, Mr Blair stated that Iraq </p>
<p>was “not the only part of this threat”. But it was “the test of whether we treat the threat </p>
<p>seriously”. Mr Blair added that, faced with the threat:</p>
<p>“… the world should unite. The UN should be the focus both of diplomacy and of </p>
<p>action. That is what [resolution] 1441 said … to break it now, and to will the ends </p>
<p>but not the means, would do more damage in the long term to the UN than any </p>
<p>other single course that we could pursue. To fall back into the lassitude of the last </p>
<p>12 years; to talk, to discuss, to debate but never to act; to declare our will but not </p>
<p>to enforce it; and to continue with strong language but with weak intentions – that </p>
<p>is the worst course imaginable. If we pursue that course, when the threat returns, </p>
<p>from Iraq or elsewhere, who will then believe us? What price our credibility with </p>
<p>the next tyrant?”</p>
<p><b>920. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… there will in any event be no sound future for the United Nations – no guarantee </p>
<p>against the repetition of these events – unless we recognise the urgent need for a </p>
<p>political agenda we can unite upon.</p>
<p>“What we have witnessed here is the consequence of Europe and the United States </p>
<p>dividing from each other … the paralysis of the UN has been born out of the division </p>
<p>that there is.”</p>
<p><b>921. </b> Mr Blair stated that there was a risk of the world being divided into rival poles of </p>
<p>power “with the US and its allies in one corner and France, Germany, Russia and their </p>
<p>allies in the other”. That would be “profoundly dangerous”. There was “resentment of </p>
<p>US</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dominance” and “fear of US unilateralism”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>566</p>
<p><b>922. </b> Reflecting the strategy he had adopted, Mr Blair stated that the way to deal </p>
<p>with the US was “not rivalry, but partnership”. Europe should have said to the US </p>
<p>in September 2002:</p>
<p>“We understand your strategic anxiety over terrorism and weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and we will help you meet it. We will mean what we say in any resolution </p>
<p>we pass and will back it with action if Saddam fails to disarm voluntarily.”</p>
<p><b>923. </b> In return, Europe should have asked:</p>
<p>“… that the US should indeed choose the UN path and you [the US] should </p>
<p>recognise the fundamental overriding importance of restarting the Middle East </p>
<p>Peace Process, which we will hold you to.</p>
<p>“That would have been the right and responsible way for Europe and America </p>
<p>to treat each other … and it is a tragedy that it has not happened …”</p>
<p><b>924. </b> Mr Blair stated that “what happens after any conflict in Iraq” was of “critical </p>
<p>significance”. There was a chance to unify around the United Nations and a UN </p>
<p>resolution:</p>
<p>“… should provide for the proper governance of Iraq … protect totally the territorial </p>
<p>integrity of Iraq. And that … oil revenues … should be put in a trust fund for the Iraqi </p>
<p>people administered through the UN.”</p>
<p><b>925. </b> Mr Blair set out the abuses of Saddam Hussein’s regime and stated that his </p>
<p>removal was the “only true hope” for the Iraqi people.</p>
<p><b>926. </b> Concluding his speech, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“If this House now demands that … British troops are pulled back … what then? … </p>
<p>Saddam … will feel strengthened beyond measure … other states … will take it that </p>
<p>the will confronting them is decaying and feeble …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… In this dilemma, no choice is perfect, no choice is ideal, but on this decision </p>
<p>hangs the fate of many things … To retreat now … would put at hazard all that we </p>
<p>hold dearest. To turn the United Nations back into a talking shop; to stifle the first </p>
<p>steps of progress in the Middle East; to leave the Iraqi people to the mercy of events </p>
<p>over which we would have relinquished all power to influence for the better …</p>
<p>“This is not the time to falter. This is the time … to give a lead: to show that we will </p>
<p>stand up for what we know to be right; to show that we will confront the tyrannies </p>
<p>and dictatorships … to show, at the moment of decision that we have the courage </p>
<p>to do the right thing.”</p>

<p><b>927. </b> In his speech, Mr Duncan Smith stated that the official Opposition would support </p>
<p>the Government because it was acting “in the national interest”.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> Iraq posed a threat </p>
<p>to the safety and stability of the Middle East and Saddam Hussein had “the means, </p>
<p>the mentality and the motive to pose a direct threat to our national security”.</p>
<p><b>928. </b> Other points made by Mr Duncan Smith included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “in complete breach of all his obligations to the United </p>
<p>Kingdom and to the international community”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had “absolutely no intention whatsoever of relinquishing the weapons” he </p>
<p>had developed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat from Iraq’s “arsenal to British citizens at home and abroad” could </p>
<p>not “simply be contained. Whether in the hands of his regime or in the hands </p>
<p>of the terrorists to whom he would give his weapons, they pose a clear danger </p>
<p>to British citizens.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s “last hope” was “to string along the international community </p>
<p>for as long as possible”, and to delay action until the autumn, and, “in the </p>
<p>meantime”, his “prevarication and games” would “split the international </p>
<p>community and wreck the UN”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “pressing questions” about the arrangements for dealing with the </p>
<p>humanitarian consequences of military action.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If “decisive action” had been taken earlier, “we would not now stand on the </p>
<p>verge of war”.</p>
<p><b>929. </b> Mr Duncan Smith concluded that, if the House of Commons voted to give </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… yet another chance, the moment will pass, our concentration will falter, </p>
<p>our energy and focus will disperse and our nerve will fail, with disastrous </p>
<p>consequences …</p>
<p>“… We should stand firm, act and show that we have learned from past failures …”</p>
<p><b>930. </b> The Speaker selected a cross-party amendment to the Government motion, moved </p>
<p>by Mr Peter Kilfoyle (Labour), which stated that the House:</p>
<p>“… believes that the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established, </p>
<p>especially given the absence of specific United Nations authorisation; but, in the </p>
<p>event that hostilities do commence, pledges its total support for the British forces </p>
<p>engaged in the Middle East …”</p>

<p><b>931. </b> In his speech supporting the amendment, Mr Kilfoyle argued that military action </p>

<p><b>932. </b> In his speech, Mr Kennedy stated that he did “not believe that the case for war” </p>

<p>331</p>

<p><b>935. </b> In his speech closing the debate, Mr Straw drew attention to the importance of </p>
<p>a just and lasting settlement of the dispute between Israel and Palestine, which was, </p>
<p>“as important for the future stability of the region as the disarmament of Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>936. </b> In relation to Iraq, Mr Straw drew attention to the recommendations of the Select </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no other alternative” to seeking the exile of Saddam Hussein and, </p>
<p>if that failed, “his disarmament by force”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Containment “failed when the inspectors had to leave in 1998”. Three </p>
<p>Permanent Members of the Security Council had failed to support resolution </p>
<p>1284 (1999) which had been an attempt to offer Iraq “a new way to peaceful </p>
<p>disarmament while containing the threat”. Iraq had said no. The inspectors were </p>
<p>not allowed to return; sanctions were eroded, “and containment was left weaker </p>
<p>than ever”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The strategy encapsulated in resolution 1441 (2002) was “for the active </p>
<p>disarmament of the regime, backed by a credible threat of force”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no automaticity about the use of force”; “it was entirely conditional </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein’s compliance or otherwise with the resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We also said – to our five permanent colleagues that if the only issue between </p>
<p>us and them over the ultimatum was more time than the 10 days we had </p>
<p>allowed, of course we could negotiate more time. But no country … has been </p>
<p>prepared to say how much more time should be allowed before time runs out. </p>
<p>None of them is prepared to issue an ultimatum. In reality, they are not asking </p>
<p>for more time. They are asking for time without end.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would not disarm peacefully, so the choice was “either to </p>
<p>leave Saddam where he is, armed and emboldened, an even bigger threat to </p>
<p>his country, his region and international peace and security, or we disarm him </p>
<p>by force”.</p>
<p><b>940. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“… of course there will be consequences if the House approves the Government </p>

<p>killed; so, too, will innocent Iraqi civilians, but far fewer Iraqis in the future will be </p>
<p>maimed, tortured or killed by the Saddam regime. The Iraqi people will begin to </p>
<p>enjoy the freedom and prosperity that should be theirs. The world will become a </p>
<p>safer place, and, above all, the essential authority of the United Nations will have </p>

<p><b>945.  Iraq’s capability was judged to be limited and its chemical and biological </b></p>

<p><b>in Section 7.</b></p>

<p><b>to terminate inspections and resort to force.</b></p>

<p>to the course that we have set. We must hold firm.”</p>

<p><b>953. </b> Lord Strathclyde (Conservative) agreed that “to turn about now would be to </p>

<p>we look at a profound ambiguity, which people interpret in different ways.”</p>
<p>335</p>
<p><b>955. </b> Addressing the failure to secure a second resolution, Baroness Williams added:</p>
<p>“Much of the blame has been passed over to France. France has been seriously </p>
<p>misinterpreted, not least by our own tabloid newspapers … I am told by the French </p>
<p>Embassy … that France indicated it would veto a second resolution even if there </p>
<p>were nine members of the Security Council supporting it, but made absolutely plain </p>
<p>this was a judgement about timelines, not about Iraq failing to comply with Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions. In other words – surely, it is not too complex a thought for us to </p>
<p>understand – France believes that timelines for the inspectors were unacceptably </p>
<p>short … [and] would have supported the resolution if in its view the inspectors </p>
<p>indicated that there was no longer sufficient compliance with their work to enable </p>
<p>them to complete it in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>“Without the second resolution the legitimacy of our actions will continue to </p>
<p>be disputed.”</p>
<p><b>956. </b> In her concluding remarks, Baroness Symons highlighted “the breadth of </p>
<p>agreement [during the debate] that the Iraqi regime is evil, cruel and has palpably failed </p>
<p>to disarm and meet a series of UN obligations placed on it”.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>957. </b> Baroness Symons responded to a number of questions raised during the debate, </p>
<p>including on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat from WMD. Iraq had “thousands of chemical and biological bombs”. </p>
<p>The 150 weapons inspectors “simply will not find the weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction in a country the size of France”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The exhaustion of possibilities for a negotiated solution. France’s position on the </p>
<p>second resolution meant that negotiation was now “beyond our reach”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The legality of military action. Divisions of legal opinion in international law were </p>
<p>“nothing new”. The Attorney General had had access to all information and had </p>
<p>delivered a clear view.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The legal position of those engaged in conflict. Military action would take full </p>
<p>account of requirements and obligations of international law.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether military action was the right response. The Iraqi people would be </p>
<p>liberated from a life of tyranny and repression and it was necessary for the UN </p>
<p>to face up to its responsibilities. It was the mission of the UK’s Armed Forces </p>
<p>to “enforce the will of the United Nations and the international community”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>572</p>
<p><b>Events of 19 and 20 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>958. </b> Mr de Villepin telephoned Mr Straw on 19 March with a message for Mr Blair from </p>
<p>President Chirac.</p>
<p>337</p>
<p> The President had been “shocked and hurt” by Mr Blair’s statements </p>
<p>to Parliament. They had been unnecessary. President Chirac understood the pressures </p>
<p>that the UK Government was under, but such statements were not acceptable from an </p>
<p>ally and an EU partner. Nor were they in accordance with reality.</p>
<p><b>959. </b> Mr Straw rebutted the comments. He and Mr Blair had felt their comments were </p>
<p>justified by the circumstances; not to solve domestic problems but to explain the reality </p>
<p>of the situation to which France had contributed. The UK felt that, after resolution 1441, </p>
<p>“France had made a strategic choice not to follow through”.</p>
<p><b>960. </b> Mr de Villepin responded that what he had heard from London and Washington </p>
<p>did not “link with the truth”. He concluded that the statements from the UK Government </p>
<p>had shown no courage.</p>
<p><b>961. </b> Mr Straw concluded that “he knew a great deal about courage: the Prime Minister </p>
<p>had shown great courage”.</p>
<p><b>962. </b> The first Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq (also known as the “War Cabinet”) took place at </p>
<p>8.30am on 19 March.</p>
<p><b>963. </b> Mr Straw informed the meeting that he had received “an official complaint” from </p>
<p>Mr de Villepin “about the British representation of the French position in respect of Iraq”. </p>
<p>He also set out the need to explain the UK’s position to other countries and to publicise </p>
<p>the international support for the Coalition.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p><b>964. </b> The discussion on the importance of a UN resolution covering the post-conflict </p>
<p>phase is addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>965. </b> Advice on military issues is addressed in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>966. </b> Subsequently, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce briefed Mr Blair on the military </p>
<p>preparations.</p>
<p>339</p>
<p><b>967. </b> A JIC Note issued on 19 March, ‘Saddam: the Beginning of the End’, stated </p>
<p>that</p>
<p> </p>
<p>intelligence showed the Iraqi regime was making final preparations for war.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had rejected US demands for his exile and the US had:</p>
<p>“… now made clear that even a last-minute change of mind by Saddam would not </p>
<p>stop the Coalition from moving against Iraq’s WMD.”</p>

<p><b>968. </b> The Note added that the JIC continued to judge that Saddam Hussein’s scope </p>
<p>for “extreme and unpredictable action is increasing as the prospect of an attack </p>
<p>approaches”. The JIC view on the possible use of CBW is set out in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>969. </b> Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice at noon.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p><b>970. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that the French had “launched a fierce public attack” on </p>
<p>the UK.</p>
<p><b>971. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the meeting of the Security Council and </p>
<p>the need to rebuild relationships. Sir David said that Dr Blix’s work programme provided </p>
<p>“further confirmation of how little Saddam had done to fulfil his disarmament obligations”. </p>
<p>The UK was in favour of a continuing role for UNMOVIC; it would be “important to have </p>
<p>UNMOVIC available to provide independent verification when we found WMD”.</p>
<p><b>972. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke at 12.40pm on 19 March.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> They discussed </p>
<p>the military plans and timetable. Mr Blair said that he had “reviewed the military plans </p>
<p>and was confident that they would work”. Post-conflict issues would be the focus of </p>
<p>conversation when they met. A full-day meeting was envisaged to cover the ground. </p>
<p>Mr Blair suggested that the discussions might include bringing in allies who had opposed </p>
<p>military action and co-ordinating a communications strategy.</p>
<p><b>973. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:</p>
<p>“As Bush said … other leaders would look at what he [Blair] did, and the power with </p>
<p>which he did it, and really learn lessons from it. ‘Landslide’ he [Bush] said, referring </p>
<p>to the Road Map publication as ‘genius’. He referred back to what he called ‘the </p>
<p><i>cojones</i> conference’ at Camp David. ‘You showed <i>cojones</i>, you never blinked. </p>
<p>A leader who leads will win and you are a real leader.’ He said the object is regime </p>
<p>change … TB felt that the next stage after winning the war would be to work out the </p>
<p>geopolitical fallout and repair some of the divisions. Bush said Condi had this line </p>
<p>that we should ‘punish the French, ignore the Germans and forgive the Russians’, </p>
<p>which was pretty glib. TB didn’t comment at the time but later said he didn’t agree. </p>
<p>We should try to build bridges with all of them. We finally got Bush to agree there </p>
<p>was no point TB going to the US at the moment, that we should wait until the </p>
<p>fighting starts …</p>
<p>“… Bush said that the Iraqis would now be ‘shredding documents like crazy’… </p>
<p>the Road Map would be published today when Abu Mazen was confirmed …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>574</p>
<p><b>974. </b> President Bush wrote in his memoir that he convened “the entire National Security </p>
<p>Council” on the morning of 19 March where he “gave the order to launch Operation </p>
<p>Iraqi Freedom”.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE, 19 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>975.  Although there had been unanimous support for a rigorous inspections and </b></p>
<p><b>monitoring regime backed by the threat of military force as the means to disarm </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq when resolution 1441 was adopted, there was no such consensus in the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council in March 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>976.  In the Security Council debate on 19 March, the majority of members of </b></p>
<p><b>the Security Council, including China, France and Russia, made clear that they </b></p>
<p><b>thought the goal of disarming Iraq could be achieved by peaceful means and </b></p>
<p><b>emphasised the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance </b></p>
<p><b>of international peace and security.</b></p>
<p><b>977. </b> The Security Council held an open debate on Iraq on 19 March. The Foreign </p>
<p>Ministers of France, Germany, Guinea, Russia and Syria attended.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p><b>978. </b> Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC’s draft work programme had been presented to the </p>
<p>Security Council on 17 March in response to the wishes of its members, but, “on the </p>
<p>very same day”, UNMOVIC had been “constrained together with other United Nations </p>
<p>units to order the withdrawal of all our inspectors and other international staff from Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>979. </b> Dr Blix stated that he felt:</p>
<p>“… sadness that three and a half months of work … have not brought the </p>
<p>assurances needed about the absence of weapons of mass destruction or other </p>
<p>proscribed items in Iraq, that no more time is available for inspections and that </p>
<p>armed action now seems imminent.”</p>
<p>He was relieved that there had been full Iraqi co-operation on the withdrawal of UN staff.</p>
<p><b>980. </b> Dr Blix stated that the inspectors had “worked broadly” but it was “evidently </p>
<p>possible for the Council to single out a few issues for resolution within a specific </p>
<p>time”. The draft programme selected “12 key tasks” where progress “could have </p>
<p>an impact on the Council’s assessment of co-operation of Iraq under resolution 1284 </p>
<p>(1999)”. But, whatever approach was followed, the results would depend on Iraq’s </p>
<p>active co-operation. Since his last report to the Security Council [on 7 March], Iraq </p>
<p>had sent several more letters on unresolved issues. Those efforts by Iraq “should be </p>
<p>acknowledged”, but UNMOVIC’s experts had “found, so far, that, in substance, only </p>
<p>limited new information has been provided that will help to resolve remaining questions”.</p>

<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>575</p>
<p><b>981. </b> Dr Blix said that the draft work programme “would seem to have only limited </p>
<p>practical relevance in the current situation”. It was “evidently for the Council to consider </p>
<p>the next steps”. He hoped the Council would “be aware” that it had “in UNMOVIC </p>
<p>staff a unique body of international experts”; that “no other international organisation </p>
<p>has trained inspectors in the field of biological weapons and missiles”; and that, </p>
<p>“With increasing attention being devoted to proliferation of these weapons [of mass </p>
<p>destruction], this capability may be valuable to the Council”.</p>
<p><b>982. </b> Mr Gustavo Zlauvinen, International Atomic Energy Agency representative </p>
<p>to the UN, said that the Agency had transmitted its work programme, which was </p>
<p>“self-explanatory”, to the Council that morning. Dr ElBaradei would be “available any </p>
<p>time in the future to discuss … the work programme should the Council decide to do so”.</p>
<p><b>983. </b> Mr Joschka Fischer, the German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, stated that </p>
<p>the world was “facing an imminent war in Iraq”. The Security Council could not “remain </p>
<p>silent” and its task “must be to safeguard its function and preserve its relevance”. </p>
<p>Developments had “brought the work of the United Nations on the ground to a standstill” </p>
<p>and were “cause for the deepest concern”. The draft work programme “with its </p>
<p>realistic description of unresolved disarmament issues” provided “clear and convincing </p>
<p>guidelines on how to disarm Iraq peacefully within a short space of time”. He wanted “to </p>
<p>stress” that it was “possible to disarm Iraq peacefully by upholding those demands with </p>
<p>tight deadlines”. Peaceful means had “not been exhausted” and Germany “emphatically </p>
<p>rejects the impending war”.</p>
<p><b>984. </b> Mr Fischer deeply regretted that “considerable efforts to disarm Iraq using peaceful </p>
<p>means” seemed to have little chance of success. France, Germany and Russia had </p>
<p>“put forward proposals for a more efficient inspections regime consisting of clear </p>
<p>disarmament steps with deadlines, most recently on 15 March”, and other members </p>
<p>of the Council had also “submitted constructive proposals until the final hours of </p>
<p>the negotiations”.</p>
<p><b>985. </b> Mr Fischer stated:</p>
<p>“During the last few days, we have moved significantly closer to our common </p>
<p>objective: that of effectively countering the risk posed by Iraqi weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction with complete and comprehensive arms control. Especially in recent </p>
<p>weeks, substantial progress was made in disarmament. The scrapping of the </p>
<p>Al Samoud missiles made headway … And the regime in Baghdad is beginning, </p>
<p>under pressure, to clear up the unanswered questions on VX and anthrax.”</p>
<p><b>986. </b> Mr Fischer continued:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s readiness to co-operate was unsatisfactory. It was hesitant and slow. The </p>
<p>Council agrees on that. But can this seriously be regarded as grounds for war…?</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>576</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that, particularly in recent weeks, Baghdad has begun to  </p>
<p>co-operate more. The information Iraq has provided … are steps in the right </p>
<p>direction. Baghdad is meeting more and more of the demands contained in the </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions. But why should we … especially now – abandon </p>
<p>our plans to disarm Iraq by peaceful means?</p>
<p>“The majority of Security Council members believe that there are no grounds now </p>
<p>for breaking off the disarmament process …”</p>
<p><b>987. </b> Mr Fischer made three points:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “myth” that the Security Council had “failed” must be countered. It had </p>
<p>“made available the instruments to disarm Iraq peacefully”. The Security Council </p>
<p>was “not responsible” for what happened outside the United Nations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… clearly, under the current circumstances the policy of military intervention has </p>
<p>no credibility. It does not have the support of our people. It would not have taken </p>
<p>much to safeguard the unity of the Security Council. There is no basis in the </p>
<p>United Nations Charter for regime change by military means.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspection regime should be preserved and the work programme endorsed </p>
<p>because both would be needed after military action.</p>
<p><b>988. </b> Mr Fischer concluded that Germany was “convinced that the United Nations </p>
<p>and the Security Council must continue to play the central role in the Iraq conflict”. </p>
<p>That was “crucial to world order and must continue to be the case in the future”. </p>
<p>The United Nations was “the key institution for the preservation of peace and stability </p>
<p>and for the peaceful reconciliation of interests”. There was “no substitute for its functions </p>
<p>as a guardian of peace”.</p>
<p><b>989. </b> Mr Fischer also argued that an “effective international non-proliferation and </p>
<p>disarmament regime” continued to be needed. The instruments developed in the Iraq </p>
<p>process could be used to make the world a safer place. But the UN was the “only </p>
<p>appropriate framework” for that: “No one can seriously believe that disarmament wars </p>
<p>are the way forward.” Europe had experienced the horrors of war “too often”: “It can </p>
<p>only be the very last resort when all peaceful alternatives really have been exhausted.” </p>
<p>Germany had:</p>
<p>“… accepted the necessity of war on two occasions … because all peaceful </p>
<p>alternatives had proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p>“Germany fought side by side with its allies in Kosovo. It did likewise in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“Today, however, we in Germany do not believe that there is no alternative to military </p>
<p>force. To the contrary, we feel that Iraq can be disarmed using peaceful means.”</p>
<p><b>990. </b> Mr de Villepin said that for France “war can only be a last resort”. He stated that </p>
<p>the inspectors’ work programmes reminded the Council that there was “still a clear and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>credible prospect for disarming Iraq peacefully” with a “realistic timetable”. Inspections </p>
<p>were “producing tangible results”.</p>
<p><b>991. </b> Mr de Villepin stated that a choice was being made “between two visions of the </p>
<p>world”; between “those who choose to use force and think that they can resolve the </p>
<p>world’s complexity through swift preventive action”; and those who choose “resolute </p>
<p>action and a long-term approach”. He warned:</p>
<p>“… in today’s world, to ensure our security, we must take into account the manifold </p>
<p>crises and many dimensions, including the cultural and religious ones. Nothing </p>
<p>enduring in international relations can be built without dialogue and respect for the </p>
<p>other, without strictly abiding by principles, especially for democracies that must set </p>
<p>the example. To ignore that is to run the risk of misunderstanding, radicalisation and </p>
<p>spiralling violence. That is especially true in the Middle East, an area of fractures </p>
<p>and ancient conflicts, where stability must be a major objective for us.”</p>
<p><b>992. </b> Mr de Villepin added:</p>
<p>“To those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what </p>
<p>is done in Iraq, we say that they run the risk of failing … An outbreak of force in </p>
<p>such an unstable area can only exacerbate the tensions and fractures on which </p>
<p>terrorists feed.”</p>
<p><b>993. </b> Subsequently, Mr de Villepin stated:</p>
<p>“… terrorism is fuelled by organised crime networks; it cleaves to the contours of </p>
<p>lawless areas; it thrives on regional crises; it garners support from the divisions </p>
<p>in the world; and it uses all available resources, from the most rudimentary … </p>
<p>to whatever weapons of mass destruction it can manage to acquire.”</p>
<p><b>994. </b> Mr de Villepin called for the international community to “intensify” the fight against </p>
<p>terrorism; for a “new impetus” in the fight against proliferation of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction; and to “recover the initiative in regional conflicts” and in particular the </p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p><b>995. </b> In Iraq, the international community should “remain mobilised” to “dress the </p>
<p>wounds of war” and to “build peace”. No State could “claim the necessary legitimacy” </p>
<p>for the latter; the “legal and moral authority” could “stem only from the United Nations”, </p>
<p>which should also “establish a framework for the country’s economic reconstruction”. </p>
<p>Action should be guided by “respect for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, and the </p>
<p>preservation of its sovereignty”.</p>
<p><b>996. </b> Mr de Villepin concluded:</p>
<p>“In a world where the threats are asymmetrical, where the weak defy the strong, the </p>
<p>power of conviction, the capacity to persuade and the ability to change hearts counts </p>
<p>as much as the number of military divisions …</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>578</p>
<p>“Given this new world, it is imperative that the international community’s action be </p>
<p>guided by principles.</p>
<p>“The first is respect for law. The keystone of international order, it must apply under </p>
<p>all circumstances, but even more so when it is a question of taking the gravest </p>
<p>decision: to use force. Only on that condition can force be legitimate, and only on </p>
<p>that condition can it restore order and peace.</p>
<p>“Next is the defence of freedom and justice. We must not compromise on what is </p>
<p>at the core of our values. We shall be listened to and heeded only if we are inspired </p>
<p>by the very ideals of the United Nations.</p>
<p>“Last is the spirit of dialogue and tolerance …</p>
<p>“… Never has the United Nations been so necessary. It is up to this body to muster </p>
<p>the resolve to meet these challenges, because the United Nations is the place </p>

<p>“To the clash of arms … the international community … must respond …”</p>
<p><b>997. </b> Mr Ivanov stated that, by unanimously adopting resolution 1441 (2002), the </p>
<p>Security Council had taken upon itself “the serious responsibility of completing the </p>
<p>process of Iraq’s disarmament”. The reports from UNMOVIC and the IAEA showed </p>
<p>“convincingly that the international inspectors have succeeded in achieving tangible </p>
<p>results”. As a result of the unity of the international community and the joint pressure on </p>
<p>the Iraqi authorities, “including a military presence in the region”, Baghdad had “fulfilled </p>
<p>virtually every condition set by the inspectors” and had “not put up any kind of serious </p>
<p>obstacle to their activities”. If the international inspectors were “given the opportunity </p>
<p>to continue their work”, they had “everything they need to complete the process of </p>
<p>Baghdad’s peaceful disarmament”.</p>
<p><b>998. </b> Mr Ivanov questioned the “the right to use force against Iraq outside the Charter </p>
<p>of the United Nations” and the authority for “the violent overthrow of the leadership of </p>
<p>a sovereign State”.</p>
<p><b>999. </b> Mr Ivanov concluded that President Putin had extended “solidarity and support” </p>
<p>to President Bush after the attacks on 11 September 2001, and:</p>
<p>“If today we really had indisputable facts demonstrating that there was a direct threat </p>
<p>from the territory of Iraq to the security of the United States of America, then Russia, </p>
<p>without any hesitation, would be prepared to use the entire arsenal of measures </p>
<p>provided under the United Nations Charter to eliminate such a threat. However, the </p>
<p>Security Council today is not in possession of such facts. That is why we prefer a </p>
<p>political settlement, relying on the activities of UNMOVIC and the IAEA, which enjoy </p>
<p>the full trust of the international community.”</p>

<p><b>1000. </b> Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian Foreign Minister, reminded the Council of the </p>
<p>“most important commitment” in the United Nations Charter “to practice tolerance and </p>
<p>live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to </p>
<p>maintain international peace and security”. He questioned whether the US “and its ally, </p>
<p>the United Kingdom” could absolve themselves of the responsibility for the difficulties </p>
<p>of finding constructive solutions for the problems in Iraq and Palestine. He suggested </p>
<p>that a “war of aggression” was about to be unleashed which was “unfair and unjustified” </p>
<p>and would “come back to haunt those who have advocated and promoted it, instead of </p>
<p>enhancing their status in history”.</p>
<p><b>1001. </b> Drawing attention to Israel’s rejection of international inspection and supervision, </p>
<p>Mr al-Shara’ stated that Syria had supported resolution 1441 because of its:</p>
<p>“… belief in supporting the international will to find a peaceful solution to the Iraqi </p>
<p>crisis and to eliminate Iraqi weapons of mass destruction through peaceful means.”</p>
<p><b>1002. </b> Mr al-Shara’ said that “the majority of the members of the Council rejected the </p>
<p>idea of adopting a draft resolution authorising the use of force”. He expressed “extreme </p>
<p>regret and concern at attempts by some to call into question the role of the Security </p>
<p>Council in particular, and the United Nations in general, simply because they did not </p>
<p>succeed in imposing their will and positions on the Council and the United Nations”. </p>
<p>He was highly critical of those who had “reneged” on resolution 1441, alleging that </p>
<p>the objective was not to disarm Iraq “but to occupy it and usurp its natural resources”. </p>
<p>He questioned whether Iraq represented a threat to the US, pointing out that Al Qaida </p>
<p>had active or sleeper cells in more than 150 countries.</p>
<p><b>1003. </b> Mr al-Shara’ concluded that the “letter and the spirit” of the ultimatum issued </p>
<p>by the US led Syria to conclude that the objective was “the removal or the bringing to </p>
<p>justice of an individual or a group of individuals”. Syria urged “those concerned to shut </p>
<p>down the machinery of war” and to spare the lives of:</p>
<p>“… millions of innocent Iraqis as well as the lives of their new oppressors who are </p>
<p>marching thousands of miles … holding up the banner of liberation like a myth. </p>
<p>Many people – including many Americans – have stood against the foreign occupier </p>
<p>in defence of liberty and independence. That is the logic of history … that will </p>
<p>continue …”</p>
<p><b>1004. </b> Mr Akram stated that Pakistan had “consistently advocated a peaceful solution”. </p>
<p>He stressed “that every possible avenue should be exhausted to secure a peaceful </p>
<p>solution, and that the use of force must be the very last resort”. Pakistan believed that </p>
<p>the programme of work identified by Dr Blix “could have provided a useful basis for the </p>
<p>completion of the disarmament process … if Iraq’s full and unconditional co-operation </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>could have been assured and obtained in time”. Members of the Security Council had </p>
<p>been separated by “honest differences”. Once military action began, the duties:</p>
<p>“… of the Security Council to restore peace and security, to contain conflict, to </p>
<p>prevent the suffering of the Iraqi people and others in the region, to ensure the </p>
<p>territorial integrity of Iraq and its neighbours and to ensure the stability of this </p>
<p>sensitive region … will not end; they will become more acute.”</p>
<p><b>1005. </b> Mr Zinser deplored “the path of war”, referring to the UN Charter and the </p>
<p>“principles” which Mexico had learned from history for the “peaceful settlement of </p>
<p>disputes and disarmament”. He described the inspections regime for Iraq as “the </p>
<p>most robust, dynamic and effective effort at peaceful disarmament that has ever been </p>
<p>attempted” and stated that Mexico was “convinced that … the United Nations could </p>
<p>have brought about the peaceful disarmament of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>1006. </b> Ambassador Negroponte stated that the consideration of the draft programmes </p>
<p>was “incompatible with Iraq’s non-compliance with resolution 1441 (2002) and the </p>
<p>current reality on the ground”; the work programme was “predicated on the assumption </p>
<p>that Iraq will provide immediate, unconditional and active co-operation”. That had:</p>
<p>“… been manifestly lacking. No realistic programme of work or outline of key </p>
<p>unresolved issues can be developed … while Iraq fails to co-operate fully, actively </p>
<p>and unconditionally, nor can it be developed absent sound information on Iraqi </p>
<p>programmes since 1998 and all other information that is lacking.”</p>
<p><b>1007. </b> Ambassador Negroponte added that the draft work programmes and:</p>
<p>“… the paper on key remaining disarmament tasks make clear the multitude </p>
<p>of important issues that Iraq has avoided addressing. These are the kinds </p>
<p>of documents that we would have been able to discuss if Iraq had met the </p>
<p>requirements of resolution 1441 (2002), but they cannot now lead us to the results </p>
<p>that this Council demanded: the immediate peaceful disarmament of Iraq.</p>
<p>“Under current circumstances we have no choice but to set this work aside for the </p>
<p>time being … we do not exclude the possibility that it may prove useful to return to </p>
<p>these documents at some point in the future.”</p>
<p><b>1008. </b> Ambassador Negroponte stated that the US had committed “significant resources </p>
<p>… across all relevant United States Government agencies and in support of United </p>
<p>Nations efforts to anticipate likely requirements and to be prepared to administer </p>
<p>necessary relief as quickly as possible”.</p>
<p><b>1009. </b> Mr Belinga Eboutou stated that “the peaceful disarmament of Iraq by means of </p>
<p>inspections” had ended. The UNMOVIC draft work programme “would have been a good </p>
<p>basis for work” but “much remained to be done” and his delegation did “not see how </p>
<p>the inspectors would have achieved their heavy task in the absence of full, active and </p>
<p>unconditional co-operation”.</p>

<p><b>1010. </b> Mr Arias said Saddam Hussein was responsible for the suspension of inspections:</p>
<p>“Through his ongoing policy of deceit, concealment and delaying tactics, he has </p>
<p>decided to openly opt for the path of confrontation, contravening the interests of </p>
<p>his people and the demands of the Security Council.”</p>
<p>The draft resolution tabled by the US, UK and Spain was “designed to ratchet up the </p>
<p>pressure on the Iraqi regime” and had “in fact, offered Saddam Hussein another </p>
<p>opportunity”.</p>
<p><b>1011. </b> Mr Arias stated that resolution1441 recognised that Iraq’s non-compliance with </p>
<p>the Council’s resolutions constituted a threat to international peace and security; that the </p>
<p>Council had met “many times to examine successive reports of the inspectors”. Iraq had </p>
<p>“still not complied with the will of the international community as had been demanded … </p>
<p>Therefore, peace and security continue unassured.”</p>
<p><b>1012. </b> Mr Juan Gabriel Valdés, Chilean Permanent Representative to the UN, stated </p>
<p>that Chile had been convinced that “the inspections programme – strengthened, zealous </p>
<p>and investigative, carried to its logical conclusion and accompanied by growing and </p>
<p>persistent military pressure – was capable of achieving … the peaceful disarmament </p>
<p>of Iraq.” The Council:</p>
<p>“… needed to make clear to the regime of Saddam Hussein that the United Nations </p>
<p>would move towards the disarmament of Iraq at any cost. The Council should have </p>
<p>cultivated its internal unity …</p>
<p>“That was not possible. We fear that the consequences will be serious for humanity. </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime never understood the dimension of its lethargy and did not </p>
<p>appreciate the gravity of the punishment to which it was exposing its own people … </p>
<p>the Council was unable to find … the flexibility needed to set deadlines and to define </p>
<p>a path of collective action that would have enabled it to shoulder the responsibilities </p>
<p>entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations. Today, every one of us must </p>
<p>assume his part of the responsibility.”</p>
<p><b>1013. </b> Mr Valdés continued that it was “not the time for recriminations”; and that nothing </p>
<p>could be more serious than suspending the inspections process which “could create </p>
<p>doubts concerning the validity of this instrument”. He concluded:</p>
<p>“The Security Council … must now work tirelessly, inspired by the objective of </p>
<p>preserving life and restoring peace. Perhaps if we do everything that we can and </p>
<p>save as many lives as we can, the millions of people in the world who have now </p>
<p>lost faith in our capacity to make the world a civilised place may again lend their </p>
<p>inspiration to our tasks.”</p>
<p><b>1014. </b> Mr Helder Lucas, Angolan Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, </p>
<p>deplored the “fact that the inspectors were unable to complete their task of disarming </p>
<p>Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Angola also deplored the “fact that Iraq was </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>582</p>
<p>unable to seize the last opportunity afforded to it by the Security Council”. Angola [had] </p>
<p>made repeated pleas to Iraq to co-operate fully and honestly with the United Nations </p>
<p>in complying with the Council resolutions relating to its unconditional disarmament – </p>
<p>particularly resolution 1441 (2002) – and to convince the international community as </p>
<p>a whole that it was making genuine and determined efforts to disarm. The use of force </p>
<p>should be a last resort; and that the decision “should be within the United Nations </p>
<p>framework in order to count on the international community’s full support”; that Angola </p>
<p>had “advocated the principle of safeguarding the Security Council’s primacy as the most </p>
<p>appropriate mechanism for regulating crisis situations and for imposing international </p>
<p>law through compliance with its resolutions”; and that it had “defended the necessity” </p>
<p>of Council unity.</p>
<p><b>1015. </b> Mr Wang stated that the work programme, “if implemented” would “surely make </p>
<p>the inspections more organised, and more targeted” and would “help enhance” their </p>
<p>effectiveness. He added that:</p>
<p>“In the light of recent progress made in the inspections, we believe that it is possible </p>
<p>to achieve the goal of disarming Iraq through peaceful means. We should not put </p>
<p>an end to the road to peaceful disarmament.”</p>
<p>He expressed China’s “utmost regret and disappointment” about a situation where war </p>
<p>might break out at any minute. China would do all it could to avert war.</p>
<p><b>1016. </b> Mr Wang concluded:</p>
<p>“The Council bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international </p>
<p>peace and security. No matter what the circumstances may be, the Council must </p>
<p>shoulder its responsibility …”</p>
<p><b>1017. </b> Mr Tafrov stated that inspections were “truly effective only with … full and active </p>
<p>co-operation on the part of the country and Government concerned”. He stated that </p>
<p>Bulgaria sincerely regretted that efforts to disarm Iraq peacefully had “not yielded </p>
<p>the desired results”; and confirmed that “since all the political possibilities” had “been </p>
<p>exhausted”, Bulgaria’s position was that Iraq had “failed to seize its last chance”.</p>
<p><b>1018. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock underlined:</p>
<p>“… the United Kingdom’s deep regret that it has not been possible for the Council </p>
<p>to find an agreed way forward on Iraq. The United Kingdom tried as hard as any </p>
<p>member of the Security Council to achieve that.</p>
<p>“… we should not forget what brought us to this point: the fundamental failure of </p>
<p>Iraq to disarm in the face of 12 years of demands, pressure and pleas from the </p>
<p>Security Council and … virtually the whole international community. If Iraq had made </p>
<p>a genuine effort … to close outstanding issues of substance at any time in the past </p>
<p>decade, particularly after resolution 1441 (2002) afforded it the final opportunity to </p>
<p>do so, and if Iraq had respected the United Nations, we would not be where we are.</p>

<p>“I repeat what British Ministers have made clear: any action which the United </p>
<p>Kingdom has to take in this matter will be in accordance with international law and </p>
<p>based on relevant resolutions of the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>1019. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that the UN had a central role to play “on Iraq and on the </p>
<p>wider issues associated with it” and he hoped that “with the active contribution of the </p>
<p>Secretary-General”, rapid progress could be made “on this crucial area”. Ms Short was </p>
<p>in New York to discuss humanitarian issues.</p>
<p><b>1020. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that the UK continued “to see an important role” for </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA “in verifying the disarmament of Iraq and in carrying out longer </p>
<p>term monitoring”. He commended the inspectors for their “professional work” and noted </p>
<p>the work programmes and key tasks, but: “Equally” he noted that “without a co-operating </p>
<p>Iraqi government … it would never be possible to be confident of the key tasks or of </p>
<p>making progress against them”. The programmes should be kept under review but a </p>
<p>“more definitive” programme would be “possible when there is an administration in Iraq </p>
<p>which is prepared to co-operate fully, actively and unconditionally and when there is </p>
<p>a secure situation on the ground”.</p>
<p><b>1021. </b> Mr François Lounceny Fall, President of the Security Council and the Guinean </p>
<p>Foreign Minister, deeply regretted that the Security Council had not been able to </p>
<p>arrive at a common position. Guinea believed “in the possibility of safeguarding peace </p>
<p>and attaining our common objective: the complete disarmament of Iraq”. If armed </p>
<p>conflict was “inevitable”, “appropriate steps … to spare the civilian population and limit </p>
<p>the destruction of the economic and social infrastructure” were “desirable”. He was </p>
<p>determined “to work together with other members to continue dialogue” which was </p>
<p>“the only way to restore unity”. That was “the very basis of the credibility of the Security </p>
<p>Council” and was “more than ever necessary in order to enable it effectively to carry </p>
<p>out its mission of preserving international peace and security”.</p>
<p><b>1022. </b> Mr Aldouri expressed his “appreciation” for the efforts made by Council members </p>
<p>to find a peaceful solution to the “current crisis”, which had been “created by the United </p>
<p>States, the United Kingdom and Spain, with the intention of launching a hostile war </p>
<p>against Iraq and occupying it under the pretext of the presence in Iraq of weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction”. There had been “three or four discordant voices calling for war”. </p>
<p>Many other voices “responding to the international community and human conscience, </p>
<p>as well as to the principles of truth, justice and the Charter of the United Nations” had </p>
<p>called for peace.</p>
<p><b>1023. </b> Mr Aldouri continued:</p>
<p>“For the record, and for the sake of historical accuracy, as well as to reassure every </p>
<p>State that has recently made active efforts to maintain peace and to prevent war, we </p>
<p>would like to reiterate that Iraq no longer possesses weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>The presence of such weapons has been relegated to the past. Iraq decided in 1991 </p>
<p>to destroy the weapons it had produced. That action stemmed from the conviction </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>584</p>
<p>underlying Iraq’s policy to rid itself of such weapons. Proof of this … lies in the failure </p>
<p>by the United States and Britain to prove any allegation that Iraq has possessed </p>
<p>such weapons in recent years, and especially during the period following the </p>
<p>adoption of resolution 1441 (2002).”</p>
<p><b>1024. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that the inspectors had “refuted all the misleading information </p>
<p>that was presented” by the US and UK; and that the inspectors had “proved that </p>
<p>information to be false”, including the information that Secretary Powell had “worked </p>
<p>so arduously to put before the Council as damning evidence”. The US and the UK had </p>
<p>failed to “provide even a shred of evidence”.</p>
<p><b>1025. </b> Mr Aldouri added that, when the US and the UK:</p>
<p>“… realised that the world was beginning to understand the truth, namely, that Iraq </p>
<p>was free of weapons of mass destruction, those countries decided to expose their </p>
<p>real goals and intentions … to occupy Iraq and to control its oil wells … The coming </p>
<p>days will prove the reality of that truth. But by then it will be too late.”</p>
<p><b>1026. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq welcomed the work programme presented by Dr Blix </p>
<p>and would “do its utmost to complete those tasks as soon as possible and to answer </p>
<p>every question raised in the report”. Iraq had finalised two “important” reports, on anthrax </p>
<p>and unmanned planes, which would be handed over to UNMOVIC. He warned that </p>
<p>the already “dire humanitarian situation”, which was “due to an unjust embargo”, would </p>
<p>deteriorate further:</p>
<p>“Electricity, potable water, sewage treatment, communications and other essential </p>
<p>needs … will be affected or, as was the case in 1991, destroyed. That will lead to </p>
<p>a real humanitarian catastrophe …</p>
<p>“The direct humanitarian effects of the military attack will mean tens of thousands </p>
<p>of casualties and the complete destruction of the country’s infrastructure.”</p>
<p><b>1027. </b> Mr Aldouri dismissed the offers of millions of dollars of aid from the US and </p>
<p>the UK and the commitment to rebuild the infrastructure that would be destroyed. </p>
<p>He regretted the withdrawal of all UN agencies, the suspension of the Oil-for-Food </p>
<p>programme and the withdrawal of its entire international staff “in record time”. That was </p>
<p>“truly astonishing”; and the “decision to withdraw the inspectors so swiftly” paved the </p>
<p>way for the US and UK to “carry out acts of military aggression … much faster than </p>
<p>was expected”.</p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Mr Aldouri concluded by reaffirming that Iraq would “continue to work with the </p>
<p>Security Council to make the truth known” that Iraq was “free of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”. Iraq hoped that the Council would “continue to search for a peaceful </p>
<p>solution to the crisis, ensure that the work of the inspectors continues and resume </p>
<p>the Oil-for-Food programme”.</p>

<p>“Even at the precipice of war, Aldouri maintains Iraq has no WMD.”</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>1030. </b> Mr Annan stated that he shared “the regrets expressed by many members of the </p>
<p>Council” that it had “not been possible to reach a common position”.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> It was “a sad day </p>
<p>for the United Nations and the international community”. He knew that “millions of people </p>
<p>around the world” shared that “sense of disappointment” and were “deeply alarmed by </p>
<p>the prospect of imminent war”.</p>
<p><b>1031. </b> Mr Annan added that it was the “plight of the Iraqi people” that was now his “most </p>
<p>immediate concern”. In the short term, a conflict could “make things worse – perhaps </p>
<p>much worse”. The members of the Council should agree to “do everything we can to </p>
<p>mitigate this imminent disaster”.</p>
<p><b>1032. </b> Mr Annan explicitly pointed out that:</p>
<p>“Under international law, the responsibility for protecting civilians in conflict falls on </p>
<p>the ‘belligerents’. In any area under military occupation, responsibility for the welfare </p>
<p>of the population falls on the Occupying Power.”</p>
<p><b>1033. </b> Mr Annan added that: “Without in any way assuming or diminishing that ultimate </p>
<p>responsibility”, the UN would do “whatever we can to help”. There would be an appeal </p>
<p>for more funds to finance relief operations and decisions by the Council would be </p>
<p>needed to adjust the Oil-for-Food programme.</p>
<p><b>1034. </b> Mr Annan concluded by expressing:</p>
<p>“… the hope that the effort to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people and to </p>
<p>rehabilitate their society after so much destruction may yet be the task around which </p>
<p>the unity of the Council can be rebuilt.”</p>
<p><b>1035. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that France, Russia, Germany and Syria </p>
<p>had been “most forthright in underlining that peaceful disarmament would have been </p>
<p>possible”; and that most delegations had underlined “the importance of re-establishing </p>
<p>Council unity”. He concluded:</p>
<p>“The day went as well as could have been expected with no real recrimination. </p>
<p>While there was a lot of regret and gloom about the political state we had reached, </p>
<p>there was just as much focus on the way forward and humanitarian efforts. Many will </p>
<p>have wondered why Ministers were there at all.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>1036. </b> In his memoir, Mr Annan wrote:</p>
<p>“The decision by the United States and its allies to proceed with the invasion of Iraq </p>
<p>without Security Council authorisation was a defeat for all of us who had sought to </p>
<p>ensure that Iraq’s defiance of the United Nations was met by a unified and effective </p>
<p>response. But it was a vindication, too, of principle over power. Members of the </p>
<p>Council, including close allies and neighbours of the United States, had insisted on </p>
<p>the prerogative of the United Nations Security Council to decide under international </p>
<p>law whether a member state was in material breach of the Council’s resolutions, and </p>
<p>what the consequences should be.”</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>MILITARY OPERATIONS BEGIN</p>
<p><b>1037. </b> Shortly before midnight on 19 March, the US informed Sir David Manning that </p>
<p>there was to be a change to the plan and US air strikes would be launched at 0300 GMT </p>
<p>on 20 March.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Early on the morning of 20 March, US forces crossed into Iraq and seized the </p>
<p>port area of Umm Qasr.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p><b>1039. </b> Mr Straw told the Cabinet on 20 March that inspections had not produced the </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq and that Dr Blix had told the Security Council on 19 March that Iraq </p>
<p>had “failed to produce assurance of its disarmament”.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>1040. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the Government:</p>
<p>“… should lose no opportunity to propagate the reason, at every level and as </p>
<p>widely as possible, why we had arrived at a diplomatic impasse, and why it was </p>
<p>necessary to take action against Iraq. France had not been prepared to accept </p>
<p>that Iraq’s failure to comply with its obligations should lead to the use of force to </p>
<p>achieve compliance.”</p>
<p>353</p>
<p><b>1041. </b> The invasion of Iraq is addressed in Section 8. The continuing discussions about </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s “Address to the Nation”, 20 March 2003</b></p>
<p>In an “Address to the Nation” on 20 March, announcing that UK forces were taking part </p>
<p>in military action, Mr Blair stated that the world faced a:</p>
<p>“… new threat: of disorder and chaos born either of brutal states like Iraq, armed with </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction; or of extreme terrorist groups. Both hate our way of </p>
<p>life, our freedom, our democracy.</p>
<p>“My fear, deeply held, based in part on the intelligence that I see is that these threats </p>
<p>come together and deliver catastrophe to our country and world.</p>
<p>“Some say if we act, we become a target. The truth is all nations are targets …</p>
<p>“Should terrorists obtain these weapons now being manufactured and traded round </p>
<p>the world, the damage they could inflict to our economies, our security, to world </p>
<p>peace, would be beyond our most vivid imagination.</p>
<p>“My judgement, as Prime Minister, is that this threat is real, growing and of an entirely </p>
<p>different nature to any conventional threat to our security that Britain has faced </p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>“For 12 years, the world has tried to disarm Saddam … UN weapons inspectors say </p>
<p>vast amounts of chemical and biological poisons, such as anthrax, VX nerve agent, </p>
<p>and mustard gas remain unaccounted for in Iraq.</p>
<p>“So our choice is clear: back down and leave Saddam hugely strengthened; or </p>
<p>proceed to disarm him by force. Retreat might give us a moment of respite but years </p>
<p>of repentance at our weakness would I believe follow.</p>
<p>“It is true that Saddam is not the only threat. But it is true also … that the best way </p>
<p>to deal with future threats peacefully, is to deal with present threats with resolve.</p>
<p>“Removing Saddam will be a blessing to the Iraqi people …</p>
<p>“Our commitment to the post-Saddam humanitarian effort will be total. We shall help </p>
<p>Iraq move towards democracy …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“But these challenges and others that confront us … require a world of order and </p>
<p>stability. Dictators like Saddam, terrorist groups like Al Qaida threaten the very </p>
<p>existence of such a world.</p>
<p>“That is why I have asked our troops to go into action tonight …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>588</p>
<p><b>1042. </b> On 20 March, Ambassador William S. Farish, the US Ambassador to the UK, sent </p>
<p>a letter congratulating Mr Blair on his success in the House of Commons debate and </p>
<p>vote on 18 March.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p><b>1043. </b> Thanking Ambassador Farish, Mr Blair responded that he believed:</p>
<p>“… the action the American and British Armed Forces are taking in Iraq will make </p>
<p>our two countries safer and Iraq a better place for its people. I think this view is </p>
<p>increasingly supported by British and international opinion. It is the right thing to do. </p>
<p>I am pleased to be working so closely with President Bush on this …”</p>
