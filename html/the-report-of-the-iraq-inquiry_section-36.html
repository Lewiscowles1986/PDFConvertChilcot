<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the development of UK strategy on Iraq between the adoption </p>
<p>of resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 (see Section 3.5) and Mr Blair’s meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush, in Washington, on 31 January 2003.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> Other key developments in the UK’s thinking between mid&#8209;November and the end </p>
<p>of January which had an impact on the strategy and the planning and preparation for </p>
<p>military action are addressed elsewhere in the report:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Joint Intelligence Committee’s (JIC) Assessments of Iraq’s declaration </p>
<p>of 7 December 2002, and its view that there was a continuing policy of </p>
<p>concealment and deception in relation to its chemical, biological, nuclear and </p>
<p>ballistic missile programmes, are addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How advice was sought from Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, regarding </p>
<p>the interpretation of UN Security Council resolution 1441 (2002) and the manner </p>
<p>in which that advice was provided is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The development of the options to deploy ground forces and the decision on </p>
<p>17 January to deploy a large scale land force for potential operations in southern </p>
<p>Iraq rather than for operations in northern Iraq, as well as maritime and air </p>
<p>forces, are addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK planning and preparations for a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq are addressed in </p>
<p>Sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following the adoption of resolution 1441, the UK was pursuing a strategy of </p>
<p>coercive diplomacy to secure the disarmament of Iraq. The hope was that this </p>
<p>might be achieved by peaceful means, but views differed on how likely that would </p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK Government remained convinced that Iraq had retained prohibited </p>
<p>weapons and was pursuing chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes </p>
<p>in contravention of its obligations to disarm; and that the absence of evidence of </p>
<p>weapons and programmes was the result of a successful policy of concealment.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By early January 2003, Mr Blair had concluded that Iraq had had “no change of </p>
<p>heart” and military action to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime was likely to be </p>
<p>required to disarm Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US Administration was planning military action no later than early March.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair and Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, concluded that a second </p>
<p>UN (United Nations) resolution would be essential to secure domestic and </p>
<p>international support for military action. In the absence of a “smoking gun”, that </p>
<p>would require more time and a series of reports from the UN inspectors which </p>
<p>established a pattern of Iraqi non&#8209;compliance with its obligations.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair secured President Bush’s support for a second resolution but did not </p>
<p>secure agreement that the inspections process should continue until the end of </p>
<p>March or early April. That left little time for the inspections process to provide </p>
<p>the evidence that would be needed to achieve international agreement on the </p>
<p>way ahead.</p>
<p><b>The response to resolution 1441</b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s response</b></p>
<p><b>3.  Iraq announced on 13 November 2002 that it would comply with </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Iraq challenged US and UK claims, including the UK statement that it had </b></p>
<p><b>decided to keep possession of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and </b></p>
<p><b>restated its position that it had neither produced nor was in possession of </b></p>
<p><b>weapons of mass destruction.</b></p>
<p><b>5. </b> Iraq informed the Security Council of its decision to comply with resolution 1441 </p>
<p>(2002), without conditions, in a letter from Dr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, to </p>
<p>Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary&#8209;General, on 13 November 2002.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The letter stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The claims by President Bush and Mr Blair that “Iraq might have produced, or </p>
<p>might have been on the way to producing, nuclear weapons” since 1998 and </p>
<p>that “Iraq had indeed produced chemical and biological weapons” was “an utterly </p>
<p>unfounded fabrication” and “baseless”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had agreed to the return of the inspectors, and had “already stated” that </p>
<p>it had “neither produced nor possessed any nuclear, chemical or biological, </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction during the absence of the inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq would “deal with resolution 1441, despite its iniquitous contents”. It was </p>
<p>“ready to receive the inspectors so that they can perform their duties, and </p>
<p>ascertain that Iraq has produced no weapons of mass destruction during their </p>
<p>absence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “eager for them to accomplish their task in accordance with </p>
<p>international law as soon as possible”. If they did so “in a professional and </p>
<p>lawful manner” the (US and UK) “liars” would be “revealed to the public and the </p>
<p>declared aim of the Security Council will be achieved”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Security Council would be “under obligation” by “the public and the law </p>
<p>to apply paragraph 14 of … resolution … 687, by applying it to … (Israel), and </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>UN Security Council, 13 November 2002, ‘Letter dated 13 November 2002 from the Minister for Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs of Iraq addressed to the Secretary&#8209;General’ (S/2002/1242). </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>thereafter to the entire region of the Middle East … so that it is free of mass </p>
<p>destruction weapons”.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The letter challenged a statement made by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the United Nations in New York, that Iraq had been provided with </p>
<p>the opportunity to dispose of its weapons of mass destruction, but Iraq had ignored </p>
<p>that opportunity and decided to keep possession. The letter asked why “none of </p>
<p>the representatives” of the members of the Security Council had “asked … when, </p>
<p>how or where such an alleged decision had been taken by Iraq to keep weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction”.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> Iraq referred to the American Administration having exerted pressure and threatened </p>
<p>to leave the UN if it did not agree to what America wanted; and that America threatened </p>
<p>to perpetrate “aggression”. Iraq feared that the United Nations may “lose the trust and </p>
<p>interest of peoples”. “All those” who were concerned about the organisation were “called </p>
<p>upon to exercise caution and act in accordance with international law and the Charter of </p>
<p>the United Nations”.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Iraq appealed to Mr Annan to ensure that those implementing the resolution did not:</p>
<p>“… push the situation to the edge of the precipice … because the people of Iraq </p>
<p>will not choose to live if the price is their dignity, homeland, their freedom or things </p>
<p>sacrosanct to them. On the contrary, the price will be their lives if that is the only way </p>
<p>forward to preserve what must be preserved.”</p>
<p><b>10.  The UK remained sceptical about Iraq’s intentions, focusing on its track </b></p>
<p><b>record of deceit and deception, and repeating the need to maintain the threat </b></p>
<p><b>of military action to secure compliance.</b></p>
<p><b>11. </b> In a lecture that evening, Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, welcomed Iraq’s </p>
<p>response “so far as it goes” but added:</p>
<p>“… we must remain vigilant for experience with Iraq tells us to temper optimism with </p>
<p>scepticism and to read the small print. Iraq’s intentions are notoriously changeable. </p>
<p>What matters above all is their actions not their words.</p>
<p>“… The history of UN weapons inspections in Iraq is littered with examples of </p>
<p>deceit, evasion, intimidation and harassment. I hope even Iraq will recognise the </p>
<p>consequences of any repeat. If Saddam fails to co&#8209;operate fully, then he faces force.</p>
<p>“UNSCR [UN Security Council resolution] 1441 sets out the pathway to peace. </p>
<p>Those of us who negotiated the text were determined to ensure that it was </p>
<p>not a set of traps for Iraq … But we must be clear: he will not comply unless he </p>
<p>is sure that the international community has another route to disarmament – the </p>
<p>military route …”</p>

<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Blair used an interview with the Arabic Service of <i>Radio Monte Carlo</i> on </p>
<p>14 November to send a message to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi people and the Arab </p>
<p>world that it was Saddam Hussein’s fault that the people of Iraq were not enjoying real </p>
<p>wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> He declared that the objective of the United Nations resolution </p>
<p>was disarmament not regime change.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Mr Blair emphasised that Saddam Hussein’s duty was to co&#8209;operate fully with the </p>
<p>inspectors by providing an “honest declaration [of Iraq’s proscribed capabilities]” and </p>
<p>then to co&#8209;operate in eradicating them. Mr Blair added that if Saddam did not disarm the </p>
<p>consequence would be that he would be “disarmed by force”. The choice for Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was “very, very clear”.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Blair also stated that weapons of mass destruction and terrorism were two </p>
<p>separate, but linked issues that had to be dealt with:</p>
<p>“… if we allow countries which have got repressive and brutal regimes to develop </p>
<p>these weapons, at some point they will use them, and that is why we have got to </p>
<p>take the action.”</p>
<p><b>Cabinet, 14 November 2002</b></p>
<p><b>15.  Mr Straw told Cabinet on 14 November that while the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>would need to be reconvened to discuss any breach in the event of Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>non&#8209;compliance, the key aspect of resolution 1441 was that military action could </b></p>
<p><b>be taken without a further resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet on 14 November that Iraq was required to accept the terms </p>
<p>of resolution 1441 by the end of that week. Iraq had sent the UN a tirade of abuse but </p>
<p>the response was nevertheless positive.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> The requirement for Iraq to make a declaration </p>
<p>of its holdings of weapons of mass destruction and the facilities for developing </p>
<p>such weapons was more important. The new inspection regime would start work by </p>
<p>23 December.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr Straw stated that a “key aspect of the resolution was that there was no </p>
<p>requirement for a second resolution before action was taken against Iraq in the event </p>
<p>of its non&#8209;compliance, although reconvening the Security Council to discuss any breach </p>
<p>was clearly stated”.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Blair concluded that “the Iraq regime was under pressure and the leadership was </p>
<p>concerned about the reliability of internal support”.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The issue of whether assurances to Cabinet that military action could be taken </p>
<p>without a further resolution accurately reflected the position of Lord Goldsmith at that </p>
<p>time is addressed in Section 5.</p>

<p><b>UK assumptions about Iraq’s position</b></p>
<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 14 NOVEMBER 2002: ‘IRAQ: REGIME COHESION  </p>
<p>UNDER PRESSURE’</p>
<p><b>20.  In mid&#8209;November, the Joint Intelligence Committee reviewed its July 2002 </b></p>
<p><b>Assessment of regime cohesion in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>21.  The JIC judged that Iraq had accepted resolution 1441 to avert a large&#8209;scale </b></p>
<p><b>US&#8209;led ground attack and it would focus on concealing sensitive items from the </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>22.  If Saddam Hussein believed a large&#8209;scale attack was inevitable, he would </b></p>
<p><b>probably cease co&#8209;operation and become far more confrontational.</b></p>
<p><b>23. </b> In parallel with the adoption of resolution 1441, the JIC decided to revisit its July </p>
<p>2002 assessment of regime cohesion in Iraq to:</p>
<p>“… examine how the Iraqi regime is responding to mounting international </p>
<p>pressure … [and] assess whether there are any signs of strain within the regime and </p>
<p>evaluate the speed and effectiveness of Iraqi decision&#8209;making.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>24. </b> In the JIC discussion of the draft Assessment on 13 November, three key points </p>
<p>were made:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The draft Key Judgement that the cracks in the Iraqi regime had not widened </p>
<p>since the last Assessment was correct.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concealment and the retention of a WMD capability “remained a cornerstone of </p>
<p>Saddam’s policy” and his intention was to allow the inspectors in and “manage” </p>
<p>the inspections indefinitely as a means of avoiding conflict. But the resolution </p>
<p>put the onus on Iraq to prove it had no WMD programmes. The inspectors </p>
<p>would need to be prepared to deal with diversionary tactics including lengthy </p>
<p>inspections of sites not related to WMD. The UN Monitoring, Verification and </p>
<p>Inspections Commission (UNMOVIC) would “eventually” bring pressure to bear </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein, “causing further cracks in the regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Assessment should address the extent to which cracks might widen, the </p>
<p>role of regime members and how concerns about their personal survival might </p>
<p>affect their support for Iraq’s WMD policy.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>25. </b> The Key Judgements of the JIC were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq accepted UNSCR 1441 because Saddam knew this was the only way to </p>
<p>avert a large&#8209;scale US&#8209;led Coalition ground attack. The regime probably believes </p>
<p>that a Coalition attack will not be possible when inspectors are inside Iraq.</p>
<p>5 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, 14 November 2002, ‘Iraq: Regime Cohesion Under Pressure’. </p>
<p>6 </p>
<p>Minutes, 13 November 2002, JIC meeting. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could try to overload UNMOVIC by releasing large volumes of information </p>
<p>about legitimate industries. Although less likely, Iraq might admit to some </p>
<p>‘expendable’ parts of its WMD programmes to demonstrate ostensible </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation and to provoke divisions in the UN. But it will focus on concealing </p>
<p>sensitive items from inspectors.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is no real evidence as yet of real cracks within the regime, but these might </p>
<p>appear if UNMOVIC makes real progress. But loyalty within the Iraq military or </p>
<p>security apparatus is unlikely to collapse until an overwhelming Coalition attack </p>
<p>is seen as inevitable or actually begins. And regime breakdown cannot be </p>
<p>guaranteed short of a major ground invasion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Saddam were to perceive a large&#8209;scale Coalition attack to be inevitable, he </p>
<p>would probably cease any co&#8209;operation with the UN and become far more </p>
<p>confrontational.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam’s total control means that Iraqi policy can change substantially with </p>
<p>little warning. There is considerable scope for Saddam to miscalculate or </p>
<p>react unpredictably.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Other important points made in the Assessment were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The agreement of “new, tougher rights for inspectors” in resolution 1441 had </p>
<p>been “an unwelcome surprise to the Iraqi leadership”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Regime survival” was Saddam Hussein’s “overriding priority”. But he also “had </p>
<p>a very strong commitment to retaining WMD” which he saw as “key to Iraq’s </p>
<p>power and influence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s security apparatus was “designed to prevent internal rebellion”. </p>
<p>Top officials already associated “their fate with that of the regime, fearing </p>
<p>retribution from the Iraqi population, or the Coalition”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regime concerns about internal security were “focused on southern Iraq” but the </p>
<p>JIC continued to judge that “an internal uprising would be unable to overthrow </p>
<p>Saddam except in conjunction with a large&#8209;scale external attack”.</p>

<p>PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Following Mr Blair’s discussion with President Bush on 6 November (see </p>
<p>Section 3.5), No.10 commissioned a psychological profile of Saddam Hussein, “not least </p>
<p>for the pointers this may give on splitting off Saddam from his regime”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>28. </b> On 14 November, the Private Secretary to Sir Richard Dearlove, Chief of the </p>
<p>Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), sent Mr John Scarlett, Chairman of the JIC, a draft </p>
<p>psychological profile of Saddam Hussein, based on a Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) </p>
<p>document produced in late 2001.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The key points identified in the profile included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Personal survival, survival of the regime, and Iraqi&#8209;led Arab unity are the three </p>
<p>most powerful factors that motivate Saddam …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He thinks strategically and will operate tactically. He is a judicious political </p>
<p>calculator …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>His propensity to take risks coupled with vigilance and a task&#8209;oriented approach </p>
<p>to problems has led to generally judicious decision making. However, his </p>
<p>tendency to seek and filter information to support his beliefs has created a </p>
<p>skewed appreciation of any risks he may take …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The result is perpetuation of a deeply entrenched belief that the intention of </p>
<p>outsiders is unjust and it is they who are responsible for the ills in Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The profile stated that Saddam Hussein would “not wish a conflict in which Iraq </p>
<p>will be grievously damaged and his stature as a leader destroyed”. His perception of </p>
<p>damage was “far more focused on reputation than on physical or economic standing”. </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would:</p>
<p>“… use whatever force is necessary. This is reflected in [...] Saddam’s willingness </p>
<p>to use WMD both internally and regionally if he believes he is about to fall.”</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Addressing Saddam Hussein’s decision&#8209;making, the profile stated:</p>
<p>“Although his actions may at times appear obtuse and reckless to the West, Saddam </p>
<p>is a rational actor … Each time he defies the UN or US he will push them, testing </p>

<p>their resolve a step at a time, often until his adversary is on the brink of military </p>
<p>attack … if he feels he is losing control, and becoming increasingly politically </p>
<p>confined and potentially ‘losing’, he can become very dogmatic, increasingly </p>
<p>impulsive and extremely non&#8209;compliant.”</p>
<p><b>32. </b> In relation to Saddam Hussein’s perception of risk, the profile stated that he </p>
<p>was only likely to identify alternative strategies “once something has been <i>proved</i> to </p>
<p>fail outright”.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> In terms of predicting Saddam Hussein’s future behaviour, the profile stated: </p>
<p>“Saddam maximises benefits before he minimises costs.” He was:</p>
<p>“… not aiming to gain extra power or resources but simply to maintain his current </p>
<p>leadership position. The assumption that the current situation may increase his </p>
<p>intent to take dramatic action, does not, therefore, necessarily apply.</p>
<p>“Whilst there is little doubt that Saddam’s behaviour is being influenced by political </p>
<p>pressure, there are no compelling indications that he is likely to take radical or </p>
<p>unpredictable action. On the contrary, Saddam is currently making decisions and </p>
<p>adopting tactics that make his near term behaviour more predictable and stable </p>
<p>than usual.”</p>
<p><b>34. </b> The profile concluded:</p>
<p>“… [Saddam still judges there to be some opportunity to derail moves towards war.] </p>
<p>Whilst his threat perception remains ‘potential’ Saddam will continue to pursue a </p>
<p>strategy of relative compliance, with the main intention of not giving the US or the </p>
<p>UK any ground to move against him militarily; provocation at this stage is therefore </p>
<p>not an option.</p>
<p>“Many factors within the next few months might serve to either maintain Saddam’s </p>
<p>current threat perception, or give him cause to confirm the inevitability of an attack. </p>
<p>The UN resolution is one such factor. If Saddam perceives a semblance of hope in </p>
<p>the resolution, the likelihood of him taking precipitate action remains low. If, however, </p>
<p>the resolution confirms in Saddam’s mind, the inevitability of an attack, then he will </p>
<p>have little motivation to remain compliant.</p>
<p>“In the longer term, there will come a time where Saddam may decide that a strategy </p>
<p>to deal with the potential loss he faces requires him to take radical, aggressive </p>
<p>action. He is unlikely to wait until such a threat becomes imminent. Once he is </p>
<p>confronted with tangible evidence of an inevitable attack, such as troops on Iraq’s </p>
<p>borders … he is likely to conclude that he has no alternative option to guarantee </p>
<p>his survival. In this instance he is likely to act quickly, decisively and whilst he still </p>
<p>maintains some degree of loyalty within his command structures.”</p>

<p><b>36.  Concerns about the differences between the UK and the US on what would </b></p>
<p><b>constitute a material breach, the US stance of “zero tolerance”, and the debate </b></p>
<p><b>in the US on “triggers” for military action were already emerging.</b></p>
<p><b>37. </b> A debate on what might constitute a material breach and what actions by Iraq might </p>

<p><b>38. </b> Reporting conversations with senior officials in the US Administration on </p>
<p>7 November, Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission, British Embassy Washington, </p>
<p>reported that the hawks in Washington saw the resolution as a defeat and warned that </p>
<p>they would be “looking for the least breach of its terms as a justification for resuming the </p>
<p>countdown to war”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>39. </b> The US statement after the adoption of resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 made </p>
<p>it clear that the US would regard every act of Iraqi non&#8209;compliance as an indication that </p>
<p>Iraq had no intention of disarming.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> President Bush had also warned that “the old game </p>
<p>of cheat and retreat” would “no longer be tolerated”.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised overnight on 14&#8209;15 November that there were </p>
<p>indications that President Bush’s reference to “zero tolerance” was causing some </p>
<p>members of the US Administration to seek to lower the bar set in resolution 1441.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That might include Iraqi attacks on aircraft enforcing the No&#8209;Fly Zones (NFZs), despite </p>
<p>the agreement that operative paragraph (OP)8 of resolution 1441 did not apply to </p>

<p>Hussein was obviously in breach we would know”, Sir David added that “the Security </p>
<p>Council would know a material breach when it saw it”. He reported that the US </p>
<p>Administration would continue to insist on “zero tolerance” to keep up the pressure </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, also discussed Iraq on </p>
<p>15 November, including the reporting in the US that military action was imminent and </p>
<p>inevitable.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> Mr Straw emphasised the need to build as wide a coalition as possible for </p>
<p>any military action. They also discussed the need for patience on the Middle East Peace </p>
<p>Process (MEPP), because of the political situation in Israel.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, took a slightly different </p>
<p>view from Sir Jeremy Greenstock about the US Administration’s position.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> As he had </p>
<p>previously warned, “Administration hawks” would “seek to lower as far as possible the </p>
<p>threshold for attacking Iraq”. They hated resolution 1441 and were “looking for ways of </p>
<p>short circuiting it”. But, in his view, the “debate” on the NFZs was now “over”; although if </p>
<p>an aircraft was shot down that would “lead to war”. The reference to “zero tolerance” was </p>
<p>the “key [point] in the Administration’s public presentation”. There would be a “battle … </p>
<p>between the hawks and the rest”. The key would be President Bush’s position.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Sir Christopher also reported that he had been told by a senior member of the </p>
<p>Administration earlier that week that the preferred outcome was for the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>to implode.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Dr Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, was asked, at his pre&#8209;inspections </p>
<p>press conference on 15 November, whether, if Iraq continued to insist in its declaration </p>
<p>that it lacked WMD, that would constitute a material breach.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> He replied that although </p>
<p>Iraq had reaffirmed that it had no such programme, “it would nevertheless have some </p>
<p>time now to check its records”. That might lead to a change of position:</p>
<p>“If, on the other hand, Iraq maintained that position, it would be up to those who had </p>
<p>evidence of such a programme to produce such evidence. If the inspectors came up </p>
<p>with evidence, that would be brought to the notice of the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>47.  Mr Blair suggested that the UK should be working on the possibility of </b></p>
<p><b>weakening Saddam Hussein’s regime from within. He also wanted to agree a wider </b></p>
<p><b>agenda of action with the US.</b></p>

<p><b>49. </b> Mr Blair also set out concerns about the risks from WMD more generally:</p>
<p>“The true criticism of us is not that we are doing Iraq; but that we are only doing Iraq. </p>
<p>I agree with DM [David Manning], this needs to form a major part of our agenda with </p>
<p>the US. I want the next bilateral meeting … with the US to draw up an agenda for </p>
<p>action across a range of fronts … the timing is right, i.e. not just on terrorism but on </p>
<p>WMD; MEPP and the Arab world; climate change; WTO [World Trade Organization]. </p>
<p>We need to be articulating a strong world vision.”</p>

<p><b>51.  The MOD reported on 19 November that the option of a military campaign </b></p>
<p><b>launched on 6 January appeared to have lapsed, and the timelines were </b></p>
<p><b>“uncertain”.</b></p>

<p><b>53.  Mr Hoon’s view was that agreement with the US on what constituted a trigger </b></p>
<p><b>for military action was needed quickly.</b></p>
<p><b>54. </b> On 19 November, following a visit to the US by Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief </p>

<p>19</p>
<p> He set out the </p>
<p>themes which had emerged and registered a number of concerns, including the need </p>
<p>to press the US to clarify Turkey’s position.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that the option of a military campaign launched on 6 January 2003 </p>
<p>seemed to have “effectively lapsed” and the timelines were “uncertain”. The US military </p>
<p>position was described as “get ready, but not too ready”, because they did “not want to </p>
<p>bring too large a force to too high a pitch of readiness”. The MOD was concerned that:</p>
<p>“Lack of clarity in US thinking about possible triggers for military action needs to be </p>
<p>resolved quickly, particularly in relation to the No&#8209;Fly Zones.”</p>

<p><b>56. </b> Addressing the issue of “Timetable and Triggers”, Mr Watkins wrote:</p>
<p>“To some extent, triggers are now under Saddam’s control and so cannot be slotted </p>
<p>into any firm timetable. Moreover, what constitutes a ‘violation’ and/or ‘material </p>
<p>breach’ remains undefined: many in the US are reduced to saying ‘we’ll know when </p>
<p>we see it’, which is not a suitable base for planning.”</p>
<p><b>57. </b> There was “a sense in the US” of “two broad timelines in play, implying two different </p>
<p>plans”. The first was a “high&#8209;impact event to which the US might feel the need to </p>
<p>respond quickly at short notice”. The second was a decision that a material breach had </p>
<p>occurred which would be followed by a “more deliberative build&#8209;up to military action”.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The first scenario would effectively hand the initiative to Saddam Hussein. It might </p>
<p>provoke a rapid response, but that could not be decisive because it could not involve </p>
<p>sufficient land forces to take control of Iraq, “unless … it leads … to regime collapse, </p>
<p>a scenario in which the US seem to invest quite a lot of hope”.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> The second scenario would give Saddam Hussein time, which he “might be </p>
<p>able to exploit diplomatically and militarily”. A deliberate campaign “would require </p>
<p>some 60&#8209;90 days’ build&#8209;up, and the time will soon come when the question has to be </p>
<p>confronted of whether it is sensible to contemplate fighting in the summer”. A “common </p>
<p>understanding” needed to be reached with the US and plans “shaped accordingly”.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> The MOD was concerned that, if a Coalition aircraft was shot down, it would, “under </p>
<p>long&#8209;standing plans, trigger a massive US response”, which the US might use to trigger </p>
<p>a wider campaign.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Mr Hoon believed that the UK response should include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pressing the US to “unblock” the Turkish position (on whether it would allow </p>
<p>US and UK forces to transit Turkey);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working “quickly to reach an agreed US/UK view on triggers … well before </p>
<p>we are confronted with it in practice”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>explaining to the US that hostility in the No&#8209;Fly Zones should be met only </p>
<p>by “self&#8209;defence responses”.</p>

<p><b>the issue of whether a further resolution would be needed to authorise </b></p>

<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the implications of a veto.</b></p>
<p><b>64.  The papers produced before Mr Straw’s meeting on 20 November recognised </b></p>
<p><b>that Lord Goldsmith’s advice would be needed to clarify those issues.</b></p>
<p><b>65. </b> A paper on what might constitute a material breach, which highlighted “a number </p>
<p>of difficult questions … on which we will need to consult the Attorney General”, </p>
<p>was prepared by the FCO and sent to Sir David Manning, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, </p>
<p>Sir Christopher Meyer and Mr Watkins on 15 November.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>66. </b> The FCO paper stated that “Most, if not all members of the Council will be inclined” </p>
<p>to take the view that a “material breach” should be interpreted in the light of the Vienna </p>
<p>Convention. Dr Blix had “made it clear” that he would “be using a similar definition for </p>
<p>the purposes of reporting under OP11”. The paper stated that it was not for Dr Blix to </p>
<p>determine what constituted a material breach, “but his decision (or not) to report to the </p>
<p>Council and the terms in which he reports” would “be influential”.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> The FCO stated that the US was “becoming more and more inclined to interpret </p>
<p>the 1441 definition downwards”: “Although, some weeks ago, NSC [National Security </p>
<p>Council] indicated that they would not regard trivial omissions in Iraq’s declaration </p>
<p>[or minor problems encountered by UNMOVIC] as triggers for the use of force, </p>
<p>more recently DoD [Department of Defense] have indicated that they want to test </p>
<p>Saddam early.”</p>
<p><b>68. </b> The FCO also drew attention to President Bush’s remarks on 8 November, which </p>
<p>it described as “zero tolerance” and his warning against “unproductive debates” about </p>
<p>what would constitute an Iraqi violation.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> An examination of past practice on seven separate occasions since 1991 showed </p>
<p>that the Council had determined Iraq to be in material breach of its obligations where </p>
<p>there seemed “to have been a conviction that an Iraqi act would seriously impede </p>
<p>inspectors in the fulfilment of their mandate and therefore undermine an essential </p>
<p>condition of the cease&#8209;fire”.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> Against that background, the FCO listed the following incidents as ones which the </p>
<p>UK would consider to be material breaches:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[A]ny incident sufficiently serious to demonstrate that Iraq had no real intention </p>
<p>of complying” such as “an Iraqi decision to expel UNMOVIC, or to refuse access </p>
<p>to a particular site, parts of a site or important information”, “discovery by </p>

<p>Failure to accept resolution 1441.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A pattern of relatively minor Iraqi obstructions of UNMOVIC/IAEA.”</p>
<p><b>71. </b> On the last point, the paper added:</p>
<p>“We would not take the view that a short (hours) delay in giving UNMOVIC access </p>
<p>to a site would constitute a material breach unless there was clear evidence that the </p>
<p>Iraqis used such a delay to smuggle information out of a site or to coach potential </p>
<p>witnesses. But repeated incidents of such obstruction, even without evidence of </p>
<p>accompanying Iraqi deception, would cumulatively indicate that the Iraqis were not </p>
<p>fully co&#8209;operating, and thus cast doubt upon whether UNMOVIC would ever be able </p>
<p>to implement its mandate properly.”</p>
<p><b>72. </b> The FCO stated that a similar US list would “probably … be even tougher”. </p>
<p>“Given the opportunity” in the resolution for the US to make its own report to the Council, </p>
<p>the UK needed “to be clear in our own minds where the dividing lines” were. The paper </p>
<p>recommended that the UK would need to work out “where to draw our red lines” with </p>
<p>the US; and that “in the interests of maintaining maximum Council support for use of </p>
<p>force, we should try to persuade the Americans to focus on the more serious possible </p>
<p>violations, or to establish a pattern of minor obstruction”.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> The paper did not address the issue of whether a Council decision would be </p>
<p>needed “to determine that Iraq’s actions justify the serious consequences referred to </p>
<p>in OP13 of 1441”. That would be “a matter on which we will need the Attorney’s views”.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> An undated, unsigned document, headed “Background on material breach” and </p>
<p>received in No.10 around 20 November, raised the need to address three, primarily </p>
<p>legal, issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to clarify whether OP4 “must be construed” in the light of the Vienna </p>
<p>Convention and past practice as that suggested “a much higher bar than </p>
<p>the US”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to seek Lord Goldsmith’s advice “on how OPs 1 and 2 (and 13) and </p>
<p>the declaration of material breach they contain affect the legal situation of Iraq </p>
<p>and our authority to use force”; and specifically whether it could be argued that </p>
<p>“1441 itself (especially OPs 1, 2 and 13 taken together) contains a conditional </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>authority to use force … which will be fully uncovered once that Council </p>
<p>discussion has taken place”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What happens if a second Resolution is vetoed?”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>75. </b> The document appears to have drawn on the analysis in the FCO paper </p>
<p>of 15 November.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> On the second issue, the author wrote:</p>
<p>“If this [the argument that 1441 contains a conditional authority to use force] has </p>
<p>merit (and the most we can hope for in the absence of an express Chapter VII </p>
<p>authorisation is a reasonable argument) it would be helpful to know that now. </p>
<p>We would not have to impale ourselves and Ministers on the difficult point of what </p>
<p>happens if the US/UK try and fail to get an express authorisation.</p>
<p>“… we think London seriously needs to consider revising its thinking on 1441.</p>
<p>“… from the point of view of OP4 the question is ‘What does Iraq have to do to put </p>
<p>itself beyond the protection of the law? At what point does its conduct amount to </p>
<p>material breach?’ Innocent until proved guilty.</p>
<p>“But if you come at it through OPs 1 and 2 the question is ‘When has Iraq blown </p>
<p>its last chance? (regardless of whether OP4 is ever breached)’. Compliance </p>
<p>with OP4 is strictly irrelevant: Iraq is guilty but released on a suspended sentence/</p>
<p>parole. This seems to us to have huge presentational angles – as well as whatever </p>
<p>legal deductions can be made. <b>If we are not careful, we are in danger of losing </b></p>
<p><b>the key advantage of the resolution and turning a provision which we thought </b></p>
<p><b>of deleting as unnecessary into the main operational paragraph of the text </b>…”</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Someone in No.10 wrote: “Is this, tho’ a hidden trigger? (We and the US denied that </p>
<p>there was one in 1441.)”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>78. </b> On what would happen in the event of a veto, the author of the document wrote </p>
<p>that this was:</p>
<p>“… probably too difficult at this stage – everything depends on the circs … </p>
<p>But knowing the answer to the legal implications of 1441 … would either (i) leave us </p>
<p>no worse off than we are – if the AG thinks the argument doesn’t run or (ii) radically </p>
<p>improve the situation if the AG thinks we have a case.”</p>

<p>Sir David Manning, and Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Mr Straw that he “believed we could get a second </p>
<p>resolution provided the Americans did not go for material breach too early”. The “facts </p>
<p>to convince nine members of the Security Council” would be needed. He thought that </p>
<p>the Council “would not … need much persuading”.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> Sir Jeremy proposed that “When the time came”, the UK should put down a draft </p>
<p>resolution and, “if we could show that we had done everything possible, then we would </p>
<p>be in the best possible position if – in the end – there were no resolution”.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Sir David Manning suggested that France should be invited to co&#8209;sponsor the </p>
<p>resolution. Mr Straw agreed.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that “the real strength” of resolution 1441 lay in its </p>
<p>first two operative paragraphs: OP1 reaffirming Iraq’s material breach up to the adoption </p>
<p>of 1441 and OP2 suspending that material breach to give Iraq a final opportunity. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy stated that OP4 (and 11 and 12) were, therefore, not needed to reach the </p>
<p>“serious consequences” in OP13. He was already using that argument in the Security </p>
<p>Council and cautioned Mr Straw that focusing too much on OP4 brought a danger of </p>
<p>weakening OPs 1 and 2.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Sir Michael Jay took a different view, advising that the UK could use all the OPs </p>

<p>20</p>
<p><b>87.  In his bilateral discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair assessed that there </b></p>
<p><b>was a need to be ready for military action early in the New Year, as soon as </b></p>
<p><b>possible after it was clear that there was a material breach. The chance of Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein co&#8209;operating was no higher than 20 percent.</b></p>
<p><b>88.  Mr Blair confirmed that the UK would provide military support if that </b></p>
<p><b>was necessary.</b></p>
<p><b>89. </b> In preparation for the bilateral discussion with President Bush at the NATO Summit </p>
<p>in Prague, Sir David Manning suggested that the points Mr Blair might cover on Iraq </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>“We are well placed after … 1441. International community behind us. If we are </p>
<p>patient, and let Saddam make mistakes, they will stay there. We must work together </p>
<p>to help Blix/UNMOVIC. We should avoid being trapped into tight definition of what </p>
<p>would constitute material breach – keep our options open.”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Mr Alistair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, wrote in </p>
<p>his diaries that he had been told by Mr Dan Bartlett, President Bush’s Communications </p>
<p>Director, at dinner on 20 November that the US view was that it was “seventy to thirty </p>
<p>that there would be war, but that thirty was genuine”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> They had also discussed the </p>
<p>need to “set up a proper operation in Qatar, not least to have people to make an impact </p>
<p>on Al Jazeera”.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> Sir David Manning reported that, during the lunch for Heads of State and </p>

<p>disarmament, not inspections.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> As Mr Blair had said at the earlier plenary discussion, </p>
<p>that was not a game of hide and seek. Saddam Hussein must co&#8209;operate. There would </p>
<p>be very severe consequences if he didn’t.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> President Bush added that Mr Blair had made the excellent point that the greater </p>
<p>our resolve appeared to be, the greater the chances that the current crisis could be </p>
<p>resolved peacefully. Saddam Hussein must be under no illusion that if he did not disarm, </p>
<p>an international coalition would do the job for him. President Bush had emphasised that </p>
<p>he very much wanted the UN route to work and that he was grateful for the support he </p>

<p>Spain had all promised full support. Mr Blair had said that “it was very important that the </p>
<p>UN had come to a common view on Iraq and therefore on the threat from WMD”. It:</p>
<p>“… had been right to go the UN route; but we must now have the courage to go </p>
<p>the whole way. The international community had expressed its will and set out its </p>
<p>demands. It must not flinch from enforcing them.”</p>
<p><b>94. </b> In the press conference before the bilateral meeting with Mr Blair, President Bush </p>
<p>was asked about his expectations of support from the UK in the event of “possible </p>
<p>conflict” in Iraq.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> He replied:</p>
<p>“My expectation is that we can do this peacefully if Saddam Hussein disarms … </p>
<p>If he chooses not to disarm, we will work with our close friends, the closest of which </p>
<p>is Great Britain, and we will disarm him. But our first choice is not to use the military </p>
<p>option, our first choice is for Mr Saddam Hussein to disarm and that is where we will </p>
<p>be devoting a lot of our energies.”</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“We will do what is necessary both to secure ourselves at home and to make sure </p>
<p>that the will of the United Nations is enforced abroad. And I think what you will </p>
<p>find here at the NATO Summit is a total and united determination … that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein has to disarm himself … and how that happens is a choice for him. We </p>
<p>hope and want it to happen through the United Nations inspectors … But if he fails </p>
<p>to co&#8209;operate with them … then he will be disarmed by force, and that is the clear </p>
<p>will of the international community …”</p>
<p><b>96. </b> In his bilateral discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair confirmed that the UK would </p>
<p>support the US militarily if necessary.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>97. </b> In response to a request for his views on the military planning, Mr Blair said there </p>
<p>was a need to be ready for military action early in the New Year and as soon as possible </p>
<p>after it became clear that there was a material breach. There was a chance of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein co&#8209;operating, but it was “no higher than 20 percent”.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> In a discussion about what co&#8209;operation meant, Mr Blair’s view was that Iraq’s </p>
<p>duty to co&#8209;operate extended to the declaration, the inspections and the interviews. </p>
<p>The inspectors were “meant to enter Iraq and dismantle all the WMD with full </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation with Iraq … [I]t was not a game of cat and mouse.” He thought that </p>
<p>“Saddam would miscalculate at some point”. Mr Blair doubted that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>would admit to up to date WMD facilities or technology, but he might admit to some </p>
<p>residual WMD.</p>

<p>and to be clear about his role, including that it would not be for Dr Blix to take decisions </p>
<p>on military action.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the importance of moving forward </p>
<p>on the Middle East Peace Process, which would become easier to manage without </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, and the need to persuade Israel not to escalate the conflict if it </p>
<p>was attacked by Iraq.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Describing the Summit in his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that the “press were all </p>
<p>focused on Iraq, and on the line that the US had pretty much decided”.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that President Bush:</p>
<p>“… felt there was a need for real pressure to build through troop movements, </p>
<p>international condemnation, really tough and unpredictable inspections, to get </p>
<p>Saddam off balance.</p>
<p>“… once we made that phone call that agrees Saddam’s in breach, we had to do </p>
<p>something militarily and quickly. Quick sustainable bombing raid, and boots on the </p>
<p>ground … [I]f Blix gets dicked around, while a US or UK plane gets shot down, we </p>
<p>go for him.</p>
<p>“… was clearly not keen on Blix, said he was wringing his hands and talking war and </p>
<p>peace but ‘That is our judgement. He is not going to get between us and freedom. </p>
<p>Once we strike we go for it, we don’t wait …’”</p>
<p><b>104. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that, in response to a comment from Mr Blair that he </p>
<p>“believed the regime would crumble pretty quickly”, President Bush had said that “both </p>
<p>our secret services needed to be put to work to help that. They were thinking of a list of </p>

<p>“Every nation” had spoken of “the menace of international terrorism and weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction”. The Summit statement was “a remarkable statement of defiance” </p>
<p>which had “rightly” linked terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The threat from </p>
<p>WMD “in the hands of rogue unstable states” was:</p>
<p>“… not part of some different danger …</p>
<p>“The strength of the … statement on Iraq was testimony to that belief. There was </p>
<p>complete unanimity … that the choice for war or peace lies with Saddam, and that </p>
<p>if he breaches the will of the United Nations, the United Nations will have to act. </p>
<p>There was strong support for multilateralism and for the decision of President Bush </p>
<p>to go through the UN, but equally strong insistence that multilateralism and the UN </p>
<p>be seen to work.</p>
<p>“Some of the most powerful expressions of these sentiments … came not from the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>110. </b> In response to a question from Mr Doug Henderson (Labour) about whether action </p>
<p>without the express authority of the UN would lack “international political legitimacy” and </p>
<p>“severely damage” the UN and NATO, Mr Blair responded that it “would all depend on </p>
<p>the circumstances”. In Kosovo, action had been taken “outside the UN because there </p>
<p>was an unreasonable blockage against action being taken”. Mr Blair did not believe that </p>
<p>the Security Council would “get to that point” on Iraq: “The countries that signed up to </p>
<p>the deal at the United Nations know that if there is a breach by Saddam we have to act.”</p>
<p><b>111. </b> Asked by Mr Alan Simpson (Labour) for an assurance that, before he committed </p>
<p>“any British troops or support to such a war” Mr Blair would seek a specific mandate </p>
<p>through the UN and a specific vote in advance from the House of Commons, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that Mr Straw would “deal with both points” in the debate on resolution 1441 later </p>
<p>that day.</p>
<p><b>112. </b> In response to a question from Mr Tam Dalyell (Labour) about the effect of </p>
<p>discussion in the Security Council and if it would have “the final judgement”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that it would “be for the weapons inspectors to say whether there is a breach”, </p>
<p>and that there would then be “a discussion about the seriousness of that breach”. </p>
<p>“All that” the UK had been “saying throughout” was that “the implication is that if there is </p>
<p>a significant breach, there must be action”. There was an “international consensus” that </p>
<p>it was “not sensible to tie ourselves down to every single set of circumstances, that we </p>
<p>want to keep some freedom of manoeuvre and that we should keep maximum pressure </p>
<p>on Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“President Bush made a principled and difficult decision to go through the United </p>
<p>Nations. He was right to do that. We supported him strongly and we are now obliged </p>
<p>to ensure that the UN route works. I believe that we can do it in a way that avoids </p>
<p>conflict, if at all possible.”</p>

<p><b>Iraq’s thinking on managing UNMOVIC which he considered “confirmed” earlier </b></p>
<p><b>JIC judgements.</b></p>
<p><b>117.  Mr Scarlett concluded that the Iraqi regime was confident in its ability </b></p>
<p><b>to mislead the inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>118.  Subsequent intelligence that Saddam Hussein had made clear that UNMOVIC </b></p>
<p><b>was to be given no grounds for claiming that inspections were being obstructed </b></p>
<p><b>was interpreted as part of a policy of concealment. The possibility that it might </b></p>
<p><b>have indicated an intention to co&#8209;operate with UNMOVIC appears not to have been </b></p>
<p><b>considered.</b></p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote to Sir David Manning and other senior officials on 21 November </p>
<p>drawing their attention to “the first significant … intelligence we have received on </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime’s thinking on how to manage UNMOVIC” since the adoption of </p>
<p>resolution 1441.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Mr Scarlett stated that the key points were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq intended to demonstrate its ostensible co&#8209;operation with UNMOVIC but </p>
<p>would actually resume its game playing.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq intended to declare a small part of its illegal programmes, and overload </p>
<p>UNMOVIC with large quantities of information on legitimate activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>WMD was seen as vital to the regime’s survival, so a core WMD capability and </p>
<p>infrastructure must be retained.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was concerned about the provisions for conducting interviews of Iraqis </p>
<p>outside Iraq, which could expose illicit procurement.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was concern about the potential destruction by the inspectors of dual&#8209;use </p>
<p>facilities.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Scarlett commented that the concerns exposing illicit procurement might be </p>
<p>referring to conventional weapons programmes and that the dual&#8209;use facilities supported </p>
<p>“the WMD programmes”.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that the intelligence confirmed earlier JIC judgements, including </p>
<p>the identification of “overload” as a potential strategy. There was no intelligence on which </p>
<p>illegal programmes might be declared.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr Scarlett also drew attention to preparations to intimidate potential Iraqi </p>

<p><b>124. </b> Mr Scarlett’s other comments included the observations that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There seemed to be “an inconsistency in Iraq’s policy towards inspectors. </p>
<p>The [intelligence] indicates the regime plans to let the inspectors into any site. </p>
<p>But it also indicates that the regime must rethink a core WMD capability.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “possible” that Iraq was “so confident of its concealment strategy that </p>
<p>it believes inspectors will not discover prohibited activity. Nonetheless, this </p>
<p>[intelligence] is important in that it further confirms that ultimately the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime does not envisage having to accept genuine and complete disarmament, </p>
<p>and is confident in its ability to mislead inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>125. </b> The intelligence described by Mr Scarlett was based on reported comments, </p>
<p>including from someone with access to senior members of the Iraqi regime; but it </p>
<p>was not quoting Saddam Hussein’s views.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:</p>
<p>“There was some interesting stuff around on deception programmes, for example </p>
<p>[Iraqi] officials being forced to put papers and materials in their homes with the </p>
<p>warning that they and their families would be harmed if they were lost.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>127. </b> The Assessments Staff Intelligence Update on 26 November stated that </p>
<p>intelligence indicated Saddam Hussein was personally handling all dealings with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC; and he was confident the inspectors would not find anything, nor find </p>
<p>grounds for claiming Iraq had obstructed its work.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>128. </b> The Update was summarising intelligence from a reliable source quoting Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s own views second hand. The intelligence reported that Saddam had made </p>
<p>clear UNMOVIC was to be given no grounds for claiming that inspections were being </p>
<p>obstructed; not that he was confident that the inspectors would not find grounds for </p>
<p>claiming that they were being obstructed.</p>

<p><b>129.  Mr Blair was advised to tell Dr Blix in a meeting on 22 November that there </b></p>
<p><b>was a need for UNMOVIC to “bolster its credibility with some in the US”; and that </b></p>
<p><b>UNMOVIC should make full use of the powers resolution 1441 had provided.</b></p>
<p><b>130.  Dr Blix told Mr Blair that Iraq’s tactics seemed to be co&#8209;operation on practical </b></p>
<p><b>arrangements but no real change in their approach.</b></p>
<p><b>131.  Mr Blair said inspections should not be a game of hide and seek, and that </b></p>

<p><b>132. </b> At a press conference on 15 November, Dr Blix had identified potential practical </p>
<p>problems with interviews outside Iraq.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>133. </b> In response to a question about whether it was possible for Iraqi experts to be </p>
<p>interviewed adequately inside the country, Dr Blix responded that:</p>
<p>“… interviews were an important source of information. If there were a big weapons </p>
<p>programme in Iraq there would be many people engaged in it. The UNSCOM [UN </p>
<p>Special Commission] and the IAEA had interviewed a lot of people in the past and </p>
<p>learned a great deal. He [Dr Blix] was also aware that most of the interviews had </p>
<p>gone rather well and without great problems. There was also quite a number in </p>
<p>which the persons interviewed were clearly intimidated by Iraqi representatives. </p>
<p>Hence, there should be the possibility for interviews to be done in private, with </p>
<p>the IAEA and the Commission deciding the modalities and the place for them. </p>
<p>The question would be whether in the present atmosphere the Iraqis would be </p>
<p>willing to be interviewed alone. He said he understood the need for the interviews </p>
<p>to be carried out abroad. Defectors had been a very important source of information, </p>
<p>and would presumably continue to be so. His concerns were about the practicality </p>
<p>of taking people abroad if the [Iraq] Government was not willing to allow that </p>
<p>to happen.”</p>
<p><b>134. </b> An advance team of 30 staff from UNMOVIC travelled to Baghdad with Dr Blix and </p>
<p>Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, on 18 November to prepare for </p>
<p>inspections.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>135. </b> In Mr Straw’s office meeting of 20 November with Sir Michael Jay and others, </p>
<p>discussed earlier in this Section, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that UNMOVIC was </p>
<p>“desperate for professional help (e.g. sniffing equipment and investigation techniques). </p>
<p>So far they had been underwhelmed by the initial UK response.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Mr Straw had agreed the UK should do more.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> Mr Charles Gray, Head of the FCO Middle East Department, advised the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office that the UK was providing a list of 10 suspect sites, including the test bed site </p>
<p>at al&#8209;Rafah, which they would like UNMOVIC to inspect at an early stage.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> It was </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>138. </b> In preparation for his meeting with Dr Blix on 22 November, the FCO advised </p>
<p>Mr Blair that it would be helpful if he could give Dr Blix a number of key messages, </p>
<p>including that the UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had “worked very hard” for resolution 1441 and it was determined to do </p>
<p>everything it could to make it work and UNMOVIC was vital to that;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>would do “whatever we can” to meet Dr Blix’s “practical needs”, including </p>
<p>intelligence support;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>did “not want to compromise UNMOVIC’s credibility as an independent </p>
<p>organisation”, but there was a need for UNMOVIC to “bolster its credibility with </p>
<p>some in the US”; UNMOVIC should make full use of the powers resolution 1441 </p>
<p>had provided.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>139. </b> The FCO stated that there was “a continued whispering campaign against” </p>
<p>Dr Blix in the US press. The UK was “keen to see a programme of multiple inspections </p>
<p>designed to stretch Iraqi countermeasures and put Saddam’s willingness to co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>under early test”. But the UK recognised “that UNMOVIC will need time to re&#8209;establish </p>
<p>itself … It will not help our objectives if we push the inspectors into making mistakes </p>
<p>by forcing them to run before they can walk.”</p>
<p><b>140. </b> The FCO advised that the US was “putting great weight” on the powers in </p>
<p>resolution 1441 for UNMOVIC and the IAEA to interview individuals free of Iraqi </p>
<p>Government “minders”, if necessary outside Iraq. The UK agreed that interviews would </p>
<p>be a “very important route to obtaining the sort of information we will need if covert Iraqi </p>
<p>programmes are to be uncovered”. But the UK also understood Dr Blix’s “concerns </p>
<p>about the practical and legal implication of extracting Iraqis – perhaps with a large </p>
<p>number of family members – from Iraq and then holding them perhaps indefinitely”. </p>
<p>The US had admitted that it had not “thought through all these points” although it was </p>
<p>now doing so.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> In their meeting on 22 November, Mr Blair told Dr Blix that there had been much </p>
<p>support at the Prague Summit for him and the inspectors, and for a tough line on the </p>
<p>need for full Iraqi compliance with resolution 1441.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Dr Blix reported that he had told the Iraqi Foreign Minister and others in Baghdad </p>
<p>that Iraq should not make the mistakes it had made after the Gulf Conflict of providing </p>
<p>an incomplete account of their holdings; and that they should not repeat the mistake </p>
<p>of playing with the UN and offering too little too late. He had not, however, detected </p>
<p>any sign that the Iraqi approach had changed. Nor was there any sign of legislation </p>
<p>to prohibit involvement by Iraqi citizens in WMD programmes; that could be passed </p>
<p>overnight and would have got Iraqi co&#8209;operation off to a flying start. Preparations for </p>

<p>29</p>
<p>the first inspections were well under way. Iraq’s tactics appeared to be co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>on practical arrangements but no real change in their approach to giving up their WMD.</p>
<p><b>143. </b> Mr Blair agreed with Dr Blix that the preference was Iraqi compliance and that the </p>
<p>“inspections should not be a game of hide and seek”. Mr Blair concluded that “one of the </p>
<p>reasons for a strong multi&#8209;lateral approach on Iraq was to deter others”.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Sir David Manning said that Dr Blix should audit the declaration and be </p>
<p>ready to audit new material supplied by the UK and US. Mr Blair “strongly agreed. </p>
<p>He emphasised that it was important the Iraqis knew that if Blix found their declaration to </p>
<p>be false it would constitute a material breach”. Dr Blix had “agreed”, adding that “denying </p>
<p>access would also be a material breach”.</p>
<p><b>Security Council, 25 November 2002</b></p>
<p><b>145. </b> Dr Blix provided an informal briefing to the Security Council on 25 November </p>
<p>reporting on his and Dr ElBaradei’s visit to Baghdad from 18 to 19 November.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They had been assured that Iraq intended to provide full co&#8209;operation. The first group </p>
<p>of UNMOVIC and IAEA inspectors had arrived in Baghdad earlier on 25 November, and </p>
<p>inspections would begin on 27 November, only 19 days after the adoption of resolution </p>
<p>1441. The report to the Security Council specified in OP5 would, therefore, be due on </p>
<p>27 January 2003.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Dr Blix reported that he had told Iraq that “many governments believed that </p>
<p>WMD programmes remained in Iraq”; and that “The Council had wanted to offer Iraq </p>
<p>a last opportunity. If the Iraqi side were to state – as it still did at our meeting – that </p>
<p>there were no such programmes, it would need to provide convincing documentary </p>
<p>or other evidence.” The FFCDs (Full, Final, and Complete Declarations) submitted </p>
<p>by Iraq to UNSCOM had, “in many cases left it an open question whether some </p>
<p>weapons remained”.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Dr Blix also reported that he had been assured by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister, of “firm French support </p>
<p>for the implementation stage”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair that the UK Government would provide “support for effective </p>
<p>inspections” and that it was determined to “ensure the implementation of </p>
<p>resolution 1441 … and the elimination of WMDs and long&#8209;range missiles </p>
<p>from Iraq”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>Debate on resolution 1441, 25 November 2002</b></p>
<p><b>148.  The House of Commons voted on 25 November to “support” resolution </b></p>
<p><b>1441 and agreed that if the Government of Iraq failed “to comply fully” with its </b></p>
<p><b>provisions, “the Security Council should meet in order to consider the situation </b></p>
<p><b>and the need for full compliance”.</b></p>
<p><b>149.  Mr Straw’s speech focused on the definition of a material breach and </b></p>
<p><b>whether it would be for the Security Council to determine whether such a breach </b></p>
<p><b>had occurred.</b></p>
<p><b>150. </b> After its return from recess, the House of Commons debated resolution 1441 </p>
<p>on 25 November.</p>
<p><b>151. </b> The Government motion proposed:</p>
<p>“That this House supports UNSCR 1441 as unanimously adopted by the UN </p>
<p>Security Council; agrees that the Government of Iraq must comply fully with all </p>
<p>provisions of the resolution; and agrees that, if it fails to do so, the Security Council </p>
<p>should meet in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Michael Moore (Liberal Democrat) proposed an amendment to make it clear </p>
<p>that the Security Council should determine whether military action should be taken. The </p>
<p>amendment proposed the following addition to the Government motion:</p>
<p>“… and believes that any decision that Iraq is in material breach of resolution 1441 </p>
<p>is for the UN Security Council as a whole to determine and that no military action </p>
<p>to enforce resolution 1441 should be taken against Iraq without a mandate from the </p>
<p>UN Security Council; and further believes that no British forces should be committed </p>
<p>to any such military action against Iraq without a debate in this House and a </p>
<p>substantive motion in favour.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Normally the Speaker of the House of Commons, selects the amendment </p>
<p>proposed by the Official Opposition.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>154. </b> In his opening speech, Mr Straw stated that resolution 1441 had “one central </p>
<p>aim: the peaceful removal of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction through an effective </p>
<p>inspection regime”.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> He set out the inspection process, including that inspections would </p>
<p>resume in Iraq by 27 November, “four weeks ahead of the Security Council’s deadline”.</p>

<p>31</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Straw also posed and then answered four “key questions” which arose from </p>
<p>the resolution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What constituted a material breach?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Who would decide what happened if there was a material breach?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether there would be a second Security Council resolution if military action </p>
<p>proved necessary?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether, if military action was necessary, the House of Commons would be able </p>
<p>to vote on it and, if so, when?</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Addressing what would constitute a material breach, Mr Straw referred to operative </p>
<p>paragraph 4 of the resolution, but went on to say:</p>
<p>“As with any definition of that type, it is never possible to give an exhaustive list of all </p>
<p>the conceivable behaviours that it covers. That judgement has to be made against </p>
<p>the real circumstances that arise, but I reassure the House that material breach </p>
<p>means something significant: some behaviour or pattern of behaviour that is serious. </p>
<p>Among such breaches could be action by the Government of Iraq seriously to </p>
<p>obstruct or impede the inspectors, to intimidate witnesses, or a pattern of behaviour </p>
<p>where any single action appears relatively minor but the actions as a whole add up </p>
<p>to something deliberate and more significant: something that shows Iraq’s intention </p>
<p>not to comply.”</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Mr Straw also stated that the resolution made clear that there were two parts </p>
<p>to a material breach, “a failure of disclosure and other failure to comply”.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Addressing who would decide what happened if there was a material breach, </p>
<p>Mr Straw stated that if there were “any further material breach”, it would be reported </p>
<p>to the Security Council “for assessment” and the Council would convene immediately </p>
<p>to “consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all the relevant … </p>
<p>resolutions in order to secure international peace and security”.</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“If there is evidence of a false statement or omission, together with a failure to </p>
<p>comply in other respects, it can be reported to the Security Council as a further </p>
<p>material breach either by a Security Council member or by the inspectors. </p>
<p>The Council will undoubtedly require the opinion of the inspectors, regardless </p>
<p>of who makes the final report.</p>
<p>“There is then a clear requirement for an immediate meeting of the Security Council </p>
<p>to make the assessment … Where the breach is flagrant – say, a physical and </p>
<p>serious attack on the inspectors the decision on whether there had been a material </p>
<p>breach will effectively have been made by the Iraqis … there will be no decision to </p>
<p>be made. The Security Council will undoubtedly then act …”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Addressing the need for a second Security Council resolution if military action </p>
<p>proved necessary, Mr Straw stated that resolution 1441 did:</p>
<p>“… not stipulate that there has to be a second … resolution to authorise military </p>
<p>action in the event of a further material breach … The idea that there should be </p>
<p>a second resolution was an alternative discussed informally among members of </p>
<p>the … Council … during the weeks of negotiation, but no draft to that effect was </p>
<p>ever tabled … nor put to the vote ...</p>
<p>“I should make it clear … that the preference of the Government in the event of </p>
<p>any material breach is that there should be a second … resolution authorising </p>
<p>military action. However, the faith being placed in the Security Council … requires </p>
<p>the Council to show a corresponding level of responsibility. So far it has done and </p>
<p>I believe it will do so in the future, but we must reserve our position in the event that </p>
<p>it does not … So the discussion … in the event of a material breach, will be on the </p>
<p>understanding action will follow.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Mr Straw also stated:</p>
<p>“… the moment there is any evidence of a material breach … there will be a </p>
<p>meeting of the Security Council at which it is … open for any member to move any </p>
<p>resolution … Our preference is for a Security Council resolution, and I hope we </p>
<p>would move it.”</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Addressing whether the House of Commons would be able to vote if military action </p>
<p>was necessary and, if so, when, Mr Straw told Parliament:</p>
<p>“No decision on military action has yet been taken … and I fervently hope that none </p>
<p>will be necessary … However, we have got this far in terms of Saddam’s compliance </p>
<p>only because active diplomacy has been backed by the credible threat of force. </p>
<p>For that threat to remain credible, it is crucial that we make proper preparations.”</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“Any decision … to take military action will be put to the House as soon as possible </p>
<p>after it has been taken … [T]he Government have no difficulty about the idea of a </p>
<p>substantive motion on military action … at the appropriate time.”</p>
<p>“… If we can come to the House without placing our troops at risk, we shall do so …”</p>
<p><b>164. </b> In response to questions, Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“… if we can and if it is safe to do so, we will propose a resolution seeking the </p>
<p>House’s approval of decisions … before military action takes place.”</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Mr Michael Ancram (Conservative) supported the motion although he sought to </p>
<p>highlight divisions within the Parliamentary Labour Party by asserting that he would have </p>
<p>“liked the motion to be more specific and stronger … and to dispel the uncertainties </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>which … cloud parts of the issue.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> He referred to the statement made by Mr Blair in his </p>
<p>interview with <i>Radio Monte Carlo</i> on 14 November that if Saddam failed to disarm “the </p>
<p>consequence is that the weapons will be disarmed by force”.</p>
<p><b>166.  Mr Hoon assured the House of Commons that military action would be a </b></p>
<p><b>last resort. There were “prudent preparations and planning necessary for military </b></p>
<p><b>action”, but that did “not mean a commitment to take such action”.</b></p>
<p><b>167. </b> In his speech closing the debate, Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“Neither Britain nor the United States is looking for a pretext for military action, which </p>
<p>is always a grave step, and which will certainly be a last resort. No member of the </p>
<p>Government will risk British lives unnecessarily.”</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>168. </b> In response to a question from Mr Mohammad Sarwar (Labour), Mr Hoon added:</p>
<p>“We expect Saddam Hussein to have the survival instinct … to co&#8209;operate with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and to comply with resolution 1441, but we cannot exclude the possibility </p>
<p>that he will fail to do so. Let us not delude ourselves. All our experience shows that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein has only ever complied with the will of the international community </p>
<p>when diplomacy has been backed by the credible threat of force.”</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Mr Hoon stated that continuing with “the prudent preparations and planning </p>
<p>necessary for military action” was the “only responsible course”. But that did “not mean </p>
<p>a commitment to take such action in any circumstances”. It did mean that appropriate </p>
<p>steps were being taken “to ensure that British forces” were “ready”, and that they had </p>
<p>“the training, equipment and support” that they would need “to undertake military action, </p>
<p>should it prove necessary”.</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Addressing the US request to “a number of countries … seeking support in the </p>
<p>event that military action proves necessary”, Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“Although no decision has been made to commit UK forces to military action, </p>
<p>discussions with the US will continue so that an appropriate British contribution can </p>
<p>be identified should it prove necessary.</p>
<p>“… There is no inevitability about military action. The US is clear about the fact that </p>
<p>the issue is Iraqi disarmament …</p>
<p>“Those who have accused the US of unilateralism should consider carefully. The </p>
<p>US Government have followed an impeccably multilateral approach, first in building </p>
<p>unanimous Security Council support for resolution 1441 and now in seeking to build </p>
<p>broad&#8209;based support for military action should it be required … within the limits </p>

<p>imposed by these uncertainties, we have been considering the contribution we might </p>

<p>“At this stage it would be inappropriate to go into details of the size and shape of </p>

<p>time passes, plans will inevitably evolve. It would be misleading to describe specific </p>

<p><b>171. </b> The Liberal Democrat amendment was defeated by 452 votes to 85.</p>
<p><b>172.  The question of who would be responsible for interpreting whether there had </b></p>
<p><b>been a material breach was also raised by Baroness Williams of Crosby in an Oral </b></p>
<p><b>Question in the House of Lords.</b></p>
<p><b>173. </b> In response to an Oral Question from Baroness Williams of Crosby, Baroness </p>
<p>Symons of Vernham Dean, the joint FCO/Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) </p>
<p>Minister for Trade and Investment, stated on 25 November that she could not:</p>
<p>“… give an exhaustive list of what amounts to a material breach. It would be a </p>
<p>question of judgement at the time … it might be referred by the inspectorate … </p>
<p>it might be referred by a member of the … Security Council. There would be an </p>
<p>immediate meeting, when no doubt there would be a discussion about how serious </p>
<p>such a breach was.”</p>

<p><b>174. </b> In response to a question from Lord Howell of Guildford, about whether a further </p>
<p>resolution would be required before the UK could “go to war”, Baroness Symons </p>
<p>responded that resolution 1441 did:</p>
<p>“… not stipulate that there has to be a second Security Council resolution to </p>
<p>authorise military action. Such a stipulation was never tabled … the preference </p>
<p>of the British Government in the event of a material breach is that there should </p>
<p>be a second resolution. But we are not about rewriting UNSCR 1441. It says what </p>
<p>it says, and it does not say that such a second resolution would be necessary.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Mr Gray pointed out that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 required Iraq to declare all relevant material even if it was not </p>
<p>used for WMD production.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had an extensive database of dual&#8209;use facilities and it was thought </p>
<p>that there could be a need to examine about 700 sites.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC could take some time to scrutinise and update that “mass of material </p>
<p>(even US analysts with very large resources at their disposal) have admitted … </p>
<p>that going through the material could take months)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was an expectation that there would be “many discrepancies” between </p>
<p>the Iraqi declaration and UNSCOM documentation and approvals under </p>
<p>resolution 661 (1990).</p>
<p><b>186.  Sir David Manning warned Mr Blair in late November that there would be </b></p>
<p><b>pressure on President Bush to move to military action as soon as Iraq submitted </b></p>
<p><b>the declaration required by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>187.  The UK position remained that the declaration could not constitute a </b></p>
<p><b>casus belli. If an “audit” by the inspectors subsequently discovered significant </b></p>
<p><b>discrepancies in the declaration that could constitute a material breach.</b></p>
<p><b>188. </b> Following a conversation with Dr Rice on 24 November to “explore next steps on </p>
<p>Iraq”, Sir David Manning reported to Mr Blair that Dr Rice had returned to the suggestion </p>
<p>she had made in their discussion during the NATO Summit in Prague that Dr Blix </p>
<p>should audit Iraq’s declaration and the information provided by the US and UK; and that </p>
<p>she was:</p>
<p>“… confident this would expose an ‘audit gap’. It was very unlikely Saddam would </p>
<p>account for the WMD outstanding … and very unlikely that Saddam would include </p>
<p>the details of secret holdings …”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Sir David stated that he had told Dr Rice that he thought Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… would have no difficulty with this. Establishing a base&#8209;line audit was presumably </p>
<p>what the declaration was all about … we could not accept that the declaration </p>
<p>itself could be a casus belli. But we were in no doubt that if the declaration proved </p>
<p>false when Blix and UNMOVIC began their inspections Saddam would be in </p>
<p>material breach.”</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Sir David added that, if it was decided to adopt that strategy, “we should try to bring </p>
<p>the French and Russians with us. This pointed to a discussion in the Security Council …”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>191. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the positions of France and Russia and </p>
<p>indications that their stance might have shifted in response to a calculation that “one way </p>
<p>or another, the game was up for Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Sir David reported that he had told Dr Rice that, if President Bush was “willing to </p>
<p>continue down the UN route, he would have the international community pretty much </p>
<p>behind him. As long as there were UN cover, very few of the key countries seemed </p>
<p>likely to break ranks.” The unanimous support for resolution 1441, President Bush’s </p>
<p>victory in the US mid&#8209;term elections and his performance in Prague had “changed the </p>
<p>terms of trade”.</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Sir David told Mr Blair that Dr Rice had asked if he would be willing to talk to </p>
<p>President Bush. There were some people in Washington who would want to argue for </p>
<p>military action as soon as the Iraqi declaration was available. President Bush would </p>
<p>be under a lot of pressure from those who wanted him to discount the international </p>
<p>dimension.</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice he was sure Mr Blair would welcome a discussion. He added </p>
<p>that, in his view, the UN process had been a triumph for President Bush. “If he were </p>
<p>patient, he would now be able to take an international coalition with him all the way.  </p>
<p>This would have benefits for US policy across the board.” That would not be </p>
<p>incompatible with a strategy “to audit the gap”, particularly if “support or acquiescence” </p>
<p>from France and Russia had been secured.</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Sir David commented that Dr Rice had been “clearly signalling that [President] </p>
<p>Bush would probably be willing to continue working within UN parameters, taking the </p>
<p>international community with him, if you [Mr Blair] made the case”. He concluded:</p>
<p>“… this offers us a valuable opening to influence President Bush at a key </p>
<p>moment. I suggest you speak to him … when we have had another day to digest </p>
<p>developments post Prague.”</p>
<p><b>196.  Mr Blair told President Bush on 26 November that he thought the inspectors </b></p>
<p><b>probably would find something, and that would be the trigger for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Blair telephoned President Bush on 26 November to discuss the outcome of the </p>
<p>Prague Summit, Mr Blair’s discussion with Dr Blix and the response to Iraq’s declaration, </p>
<p>and how to make progress on the Middle East Peace Process.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>198. </b> In the discussion on Iraq, Mr Blair stated that if Iraq did not provide a full </p>
<p>declaration, Dr Blix should produce his own audit. Mr Blair “accepted that the first time </p>
<p>the inspectors found anything significant that was not in the declaration would constitute </p>
<p>a material breach”. He thought that the inspectors probably would find something and </p>
<p>that this would be the trigger for military action.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>199.  Concerns were already being expressed in discussions between the </b></p>
<p><b>US and UK about whether, in the face of Iraq’s deception and concealment </b></p>
<p><b>activities, the inspections would be able to find evidence of a material breach – </b></p>
<p><b>a “smoking gun”.</b></p>
<p><b>200.  The UK sought to persuade the US not to make snap judgements on the </b></p>
<p><b>declaration and to allow Dr Blix to make the first formal response.</b></p>
<p><b>201. </b> On 29 November, in response to a request from Sir David Manning, Mr Straw’s </p>
<p>Private Office provided advice on handling the Iraqi declaration.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The FCO advised that Iraq could maintain it had “no WMD and defy UNMOVIC/</p>
<p>IAEA to prove them wrong, confident that they can conceal the programmes uncovered </p>
<p>by UNSCOM in 1998”, but the expectation was that it would be “more subtle: </p>
<p>declaring very large quantities of dual&#8209;use items and programmes and reiterating </p>
<p>all … past declarations. In both cases our assumption is that they will continue to hide </p>
<p>programmes …”</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Dr ElBaradei had suggested that the nuclear declaration was “likely to contain </p>
<p>information that would be of use to proliferators”; and that it should not be circulated to </p>
<p>the Council as a whole. Resolution 1441 required Iraq to provide the declaration to the </p>
<p>inspectors and the Council.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> The FCO anticipated that the US might “plan to rush out its own analysis (and </p>
<p>probable dismissal) of the document in very short order” and advised that any immediate </p>
<p>criticism of a lengthy and technical declaration would be likely to be regarded as </p>
<p>“evidence of a determination to pursue military action regardless”. It might also lead </p>
<p>to requests for evidence which might not be releasable or would alert Iraq to potential </p>
<p>inspections.</p>
<p><b>205. </b> The FCO expected the US to focus on seven areas in the declaration:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ballistic missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>biological programmes;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>chemical programmes;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) programme intended to deliver chemical and </p>
<p>biological warfare (CBW) agents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mobile WMD facilities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the outstanding discrepancies in relation to CBW munitions; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the procurement of aluminium tubes.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> The FCO advised that it would be best to “delay giving a definitive response until </p>
<p>we have been able to assess the content, while expressing a healthy scepticism based </p>

<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>on Iraq’s past record of deceit”. There was a “need to avoid giving the impression that an </p>
<p>omission in the declaration would, in itself, constitute a material breach”. The UK should </p>
<p>caution the US “against a rush to judgement”.</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The UK aim should be to get the inspectors to “check (or audit)” the declaration </p>
<p>“as soon as possible through intrusive inspections, interviews and access to records” </p>
<p>against information from other sources, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The information available to UNSCOM in 1998. If Iraq declared “nothing”, it </p>
<p>“must demonstrate the destruction of material or the disbandment of possible </p>
<p>WMD programmes identified by UNSCOM”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence material provided by the US/UK. We have already pointed </p>
<p>UNMOVIC towards key sites and provided a list of 6,500 individuals involved </p>
<p>in WMD programmes”; the DIS was “working on a top ten list of people”. </p>
<p>UNMOVIC/IAEA was “willing to visit sites not mentioned” by Iraq but they would </p>
<p>“not want to be seen to be taking instructions from the UK/US”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Information obtained … through early interviews …”</p>
<p>Where the declaration was “inconsistent with intelligence”, the UK would “want </p>
<p>UNMOVIC/IAEA to be able to discover that inconsistency on the ground before notifying </p>
<p>the Council”. That would avoid giving Iraq the chance to conceal evidence.</p>
<p><b>208. </b> The FCO stated that an early initial meeting of the Security Council in </p>
<p>mid&#8209;December would demonstrate support for the inspectors and maintain pressure </p>
<p>on Iraq as well as demonstrating the intention “to keep the Council at the centre of Iraq </p>
<p>handling”. That should also call for a more detailed discussion of the declaration in early </p>
<p>January. That would “give the US/UK a better opportunity (and more time) to highlight </p>
<p>shortcomings” before the meeting of the Council to discuss the inspectors report, which </p>
<p>was due on 27 January.</p>
<p><b>209. </b> The FCO letter also provided a refined version of the advice in its letter to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning of 15 November about what might comprise a material breach. This was further </p>
<p>refined in advice on 6 December, which is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Mr Campbell had asked Mr John Williams, FCO Press Secretary, for “a wider </p>
<p>note on handling in the context of a set of public objectives to be agreed with the US”. </p>
<p>That would include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration would be “a key test of Iraq’s willingness to comply”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors needed to test the declaration before a decision could be taken </p>
<p>on whether Saddam Hussein was in breach or complying.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would be drawing “any discrepancies or mis&#8209;statements … to the </p>
<p>attention of UNMOVIC/IAEA and, if necessary the Security Council, where the </p>
<p>issues will be pursued”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With “his long record of obstruction and deceit”, Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“unlikely to make an honest declaration”; the UK wanted “to see his dishonesty </p>
<p>demonstrated by inspections” if he made a false declaration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would not allow the process “to become an indefinite game of hide </p>
<p>and seek”.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> In a discussion between No.10 and FCO officials and a team of US officials on </p>
<p>2 December, one senior US official expressed doubts about whether the inspectors </p>
<p>would ever find any WMD evidence.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>212. </b> In a separate meeting between FCO and MOD officials and the team of US </p>
<p>officials, it was suggested that the strategy of “force of [sic] mind” had not got through to </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, partly it was thought because of the mixed signals from France and </p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> One US official thought that once he did get that message Saddam’s position </p>
<p>might “shift very quickly”.</p>
<p><b>213. </b> Concerns were also expressed about the activities of Al Qaida in northern Iraq.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> On 3 and 4 December, Sir David Manning discussed the need to avoid making </p>
<p>snap judgements on the Iraqi declaration and the advantages of allowing Dr Blix time </p>
<p>to make the first formal response with Dr Rice.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> They also discussed the need to avoid </p>
<p>“the prospect of a protracted game of hide and seek, waiting to see whether Saddam </p>
<p>could be caught out, or whether he would make a mistake”.</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Sir David recorded that the US Administration was “now thinking hard about what </p>
<p>might constitute triggers” and asked the FCO for advice on that before a telephone call </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and President Bush the following week.</p>
<p><b>216. </b> On 5 December, Mr Straw told Cabinet that the Iraqi declaration was “likely to be </p>
<p>lengthy” and “designed to show dissension inside the United Nations”.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> It was “unlikely </p>
<p>to be fully compliant”. The weapons inspectorates should be “encouraged to make a </p>
<p>proper assessment”.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> No further discussion on Iraq was recorded.</p>
<p><b>218.  The FCO advised on 6 December that there was no agreement in the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council on precise criteria for what would constitute a material breach. Each case </b></p>
<p><b>would need to be considered in the light of circumstances.</b></p>
<p><b>219.  The FCO position was increasingly shifting from a single specific </b></p>

<p><b>non&#8209;co&#8209;operation over time demonstrating that Iraq had no intention of complying </b></p>
<p><b>with its obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>220. </b> Following its advice of 15 and 29 November, Mr Straw’s Private Office responded </p>
<p>on 6 December to Sir David Manning’s request for further advice on what would </p>
<p>constitute a “trigger” for action.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>221. </b> The FCO stated that a material breach could not “be a minor violation but must </p>
<p>be a violation of a provision essential to achieving the object or purpose of the original </p>
<p>Gulf War [1991] cease&#8209;fire”. That position had been reflected in Mr Straw’s remarks in </p>
<p>the House of Commons on 25 November. The FCO expected most members of the </p>
<p>Security Council to take a similar view.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Consistent with the advice sent to Sir David on 15 and 29 November, the FCO </p>
<p>wrote that there were two broad areas where Iraqi behaviour could amount to a </p>
<p>material breach:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Non&#8209;compliance with its disarmament obligations</b> – if Iraq concealed WMD. </p>
<p>Evidence might take the form of discovery of WMD material not included in the </p>
<p>declaration or evidence which Iraq could not satisfactorily explain which clearly </p>
<p>pointed to a concealed WMD programme (e.g. a yellowcake receipt).</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Non&#8209;co&#8209;operation with UNMOVIC/IAEA </b>– if Iraq’s behaviour demonstrated </p>
<p>that it had no intention of co&#8209;operating fully with UNMOVIC in fulfilling its </p>
<p>mandate under resolution 1441 (2002) or other relevant resolutions. Evidence </p>
<p>might comprise a single incident such as denying access to a particular site, </p>
<p>information or personnel. Evidence of coaching witnesses or smuggling </p>
<p>information out of potential sites would be “pretty damning”. Attempts to impede </p>
<p>the removal and destruction of WMD or related material would be potentially a </p>
<p>material breach.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> The FCO view was that there would be no need for “a single specific instance”. </p>
<p>A “pattern of lower level incidents” could amount to a demonstration of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>sufficiently serious to constitute a material breach. Indications of concealment could </p>
<p>include “a series of unanswered questions identified by UNMOVIC/IAEA which </p>
<p>suggested a concealed WMD programme” or “failure … to demonstrate convincingly </p>
<p>that the WMD material identified by UNSCOM in 1998 had been destroyed and properly </p>
<p>accounted for”. “Much would depend on the circumstances and whether the incidents </p>
<p>demonstrated deliberate non&#8209;co&#8209;operation rather than inefficiency or confusion.”</p>
<p><b>224. </b> The FCO concluded that there were:</p>
<p>“… bound to be grey areas over whether Iraqi failures are sufficiently serious to </p>
<p>constitute a material breach. There is no agreement in the Council on the precise </p>
<p>criteria. We would need in each case to look at the particular circumstances. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Moreover, some incidents of non&#8209;compliance may be susceptible to remedial action </p>
<p>by UNMOVIC/IAEA (e.g. by destroying weapons etc). In such cases, those seeking </p>
<p>to trigger enforcement action would need to explain how such action would be </p>
<p>necessary to enforce Iraqi compliance.”</p>
<p><b>225. </b> When Dr Blix briefed members of the Security Council on 6 December, the Council </p>
<p>decided to make UNMOVIC “the depository of the declaration” and asked UNMOVIC </p>
<p>and the IAEA to “review it immediately, with their experts and from the standpoint of </p>
<p>existing international treaties, for any areas in the declaration that may contribute to </p>
<p>proliferation, or be sensitive, in order to assure confidentiality of that information”.</p>
<p>69</p>

<p>Members of the Council would meet the following week to decide on the further handling </p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 6 December 2002: ‘Iraq: Military Options’</b></p>
<p><b>226.  A JIC assessment of Iraq’s military options on 6 December confirmed that </b></p>
<p><b>a massive ground force would be required to be certain of toppling Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein and highlighted the possibility of Iraqi attacks on Coalition Forces.</b></p>
<p><b>227. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC evaluated Iraq’s military capabilities and its </p>
<p>military options and issued an Assessment on 6 December.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>228. </b> In the JIC discussion on 4 December, the draft Assessment was described as </p>
<p>“an important paper which highlighted the gaps in our knowledge”.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> The judgements </p>
<p>were based “largely on a mixture of observation and past experience”, but the draft </p>
<p>Assessment “did not quite do justice to the intelligence”; the judgements “could be </p>
<p>made more confidently”. The Assessment needed to bring out more clearly the risks of </p>
<p>a phased attack and unpack the risks involved in possible scenarios, such as the use </p>
<p>of CBW before Coalition Forces were properly assembled and urban fighting: “Nothing </p>
<p>short of a massive deployment would guarantee overthrowing the regime.”</p>
<p><b>229. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would “initially seek international pressure to halt Coalition </p>
<p>[military] action”. If that failed, he would “seek to inflict serious casualties on </p>
<p>Iraq’s neighbours and on Coalition Forces”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A ground attack might fracture Saddam’s regime, but only a massive Coalition </p>
<p>force was guaranteed to topple him. The smaller the initial Coalition force, the </p>
<p>more likely Iraqi forces were to resist. A phased Coalition attack could allow Iraq </p>
<p>to claim military successes.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>237. </b> In an interview for the <i>Financial Times</i> published on its website on 9 December, </p>
<p>Mr Blair was reported to have stated that war with Iraq was “plainly not inevitable” </p>
<p>if Saddam Hussein complied, but:</p>
<p>“… you would have to be somewhat naive not to be sceptical about the likelihood of </p>
<p>his compliance, given his past history … If he fails to co&#8209;operate, either in any false </p>
<p>declaration or in refusing access to the sites, or interviewing witnesses, or any of the </p>
<p>rest of it, then that is a breach. And in those circumstances, my understanding is that </p>
<p>the United Nations are very clear that there should [be] action.</p>
<p>“As for a second resolution, we said we would go back for a discussion …</p>
<p>“We want to do this with the maximum international support and I believe that </p>
<p>support will be there … in my view it is clear and right that if Saddam is in breach </p>
<p>then we have to impose by conflict, that which we would have preferred to impose </p>
<p>by the will of the UN and the inspectors.”</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Asked if he was saying he did not need a second resolution to take military action, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“If we get to a situation … where there is a clear breach and … someone puts an </p>
<p>unreasonable block … on it [action] … as we have seen before … over Kosovo you </p>
<p>cannot say there are no set of circumstances in which you would ever refuse to act, </p>
<p>because in my view if he breaches and the UN does nothing, then the authority of </p>
<p>the UN is then hugely weakened. But I don’t believe that will happen.</p>
<p>“I believe that at the heart of that UN resolution is really a deal … which said … </p>
<p>the US and the UK and those who feel really strongly about the threat that Saddam </p>
<p>and weapons of mass destruction pose, they are prepared to go the UN route, to </p>
<p>bring everyone together … we will put in the inspectors and give him the chance </p>
<p>to comply. We’ll go back to the UN route as the way of enforcing this, then the quid </p>
<p>pro quo is … if he then having been given the chance to do the right thing does the </p>
<p>wrong thing, we are not going to walk away from it.”</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Blair also emphasised the threat posed by WMD and the “enormous” potential </p>
<p>for them to “fall into the hands of either unstable states or terrorist groups”.</p>
<p><b>240. </b> During a discussion of the deficiencies in Iraq’s declaration between Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Secretary Powell on 11 December, and in response to probing about the statement that </p>
<p>“a deficient declaration would be enough” to warrant action, Mr Straw told Secretary </p>
<p>Powell that he did not think Mr Blair had “gone beyond the well rehearsed UK lines on </p>
<p>two resolutions”.</p>

<p><b>244.  Mr Blair was advised on 11 December that there was impatience in the US </b></p>

<p><b>245.  There was a need to build “the strongest possible case” that Saddam </b></p>

<p><b>246. </b> Sir David Manning and Sir Richard Dearlove had a joint meeting with Dr Rice and </p>
<p>Mr George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, in Washington on 9 December.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>247. </b> Sir David reported to Mr Blair that Dr Rice had “clearly been provoked” by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s “challenge that it was up to us to prove he had WMD rather than up to him to </p>
<p>prove he did not”. She was:</p>
<p>“… confident that the [Iraqi] declaration would be a sham. The [US] Administration </p>
<p>would in due course declare it deficient and say that Saddam was in material </p>
<p>breach. But she again accepted that this would not amount to a casus belli.”</p>
<p><b>248. </b> Dr Rice had “made no effort to hide the fact that the Administration would now be </p>
<p>looking to build the case for early military action … probably mid/late February as we </p>
<p>suspected”. But she had:</p>
<p>“… denied that military planning was dictating the timetable. The need to resolve </p>
<p>the crisis quickly was dictated by political factors. Internally … President [Bush] was </p>
<p>being ‘griddled’. Externally, the international community … would soon lose their </p>
<p>nerve if they began to doubt our determination to impose disarmament on Saddam </p>
<p>if he did not disarm himself. And if we let the inspections process run, and Blix found </p>
<p>nothing as was only too likely, the Russians, French and others would deride US and </p>
<p>UK claims … leaving us exposed and Saddam strengthened.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>249. </b> Sir David reported that he had been clear about Mr Blair’s determination that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had to disarm or be disarmed; he was “obliged to co&#8209;operate” and </p>
<p>if he didn’t, “he would be in breach and military action would follow”.</p>
<p><b>250. </b> Sir David said that Iraq’s declaration should be handled in a way “calculated to </p>
<p>maintain Coalition support and to try to secure a second resolution”. He thought that was </p>
<p>possible, but Dr Rice’s.</p>
<p>“… impatience for action was much more obvious than her commitment to secure </p>
<p>international backing. She wanted to know what I thought would constitute material </p>
<p>breach, and how we could catch Saddam out if he did not trap himself through his </p>
<p>own mistakes.”</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that some cases would be straightforward, such as:</p>
<p>“… the discovery of VX, anthrax, or a nuclear programme … But it would be much </p>
<p>more difficult if we were dogged by a series of low&#8209;level and less clear&#8209;cut acts of </p>
<p>obstruction … We would then be in a grey area where it would be much harder to </p>
<p>persuade the international community to act.”</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Sir David stated that the UK needed “a convincing case based on evidence. Public </p>
<p>defiance by Saddam was not the same as proving non&#8209;compliance.” The US and UK </p>
<p>“should work hard over the next couple of months to build our case and secure a second </p>
<p>resolution”. That would comprise three strands of action:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Analysing the declaration: “If Saddam failed to address the discrepancies </p>
<p>identified by UNSCOM … would immediately have a powerful argument that the </p>
<p>declaration was false and incomplete”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the smoking gun: it was unlikely but not impossible, that we would acquire </p>
<p>intelligence that caught Saddam red&#8209;handed …” Dr Rice thought the chances </p>
<p>of that were “very slim”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Pattern of deceit”: building up “a comprehensive picture of Saddam’s </p>
<p>obstruction and deception. This would consist of the steady accumulation of </p>
<p>examples that might be small in themselves but would be telling when taken </p>
<p>together”.</p>
<p><b>253. </b> Dr Rice had agreed the US and UK should pursue those strands and:</p>
<p>“… would like to go to the Security Council around the end of January or early </p>
<p>February to make the case that Saddam was not co&#8209;operating and the time had </p>
<p>come for military action.”</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Before that, Mr Blair and President Bush “should meet to review the evidence and </p>
<p>the options”.</p>
<p><b>255. </b> Sir David wrote that Dr Rice was “very irritated” about Dr Blix’s reluctance to </p>
<p>interview key individuals outside Iraq, and she was “impervious to arguments” that those </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>identified might refuse because of fear for their lives or those of their families. If Dr Blix </p>
<p>would not use the powers in resolution 1441, he would “have to go”.</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Sir David reported that he had also “raised the question of British energy </p>
<p>companies”. He “hoped they would be treated fairly and not overlooked if Saddam left </p>
<p>the scene and new oil and gas concessions were being allocated”.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> Dr Rice had responded that:</p>
<p>“… it would be particularly unjust if those energy companies who had observed </p>
<p>the sanctions regime …. were not among the beneficiaries in a post&#8209;Saddam Iraq. </p>
<p>She knew UK companies belonged in this category.”</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Sir David concluded:</p>
<p>“Condi’s mood has hardened substantially since the NATO Prague Summit in favour </p>
<p>of early military action. (This may be fuelled by a President who is increasingly </p>
<p>uncomfortable with pressure inside the Republican Party, and riled by Saddam’s </p>
<p>taunts). She does not expect the inspections process to produce conclusive </p>
<p>(perhaps not even convincing) evidence. This is prompting her insistence that </p>
<p>we must make clear that the burden of proof is on Saddam, not us … From this </p>
<p>evidence I think there is a real risk that the Administration will overdo the pressure </p>
<p>on Blix: they might force him into resignation with damaging repercussions …</p>
<p>“The mood of the Administration could shift again. But on present form they look </p>
<p>intent on military action in February/March. We need to ensure that they use the next </p>
<p>two to three months to build the strongest possible case that Saddam is in material </p>
<p>breach; and then secure the widest possible international coalition of support for </p>
<p>action expressed through a second … resolution. We are in for a tough few weeks. </p>
<p>Your influence with Bush will be critical.”</p>
<p><b>259. </b> Sir David recommended:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinating US and UK reactions to the Iraqi declaration and asking pointed </p>
<p>questions exposing its shortcomings, “putting the onus on Saddam to explain </p>
<p>and justify”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>impressing on Dr Blix the need for a “robust and energetic inspections regime, </p>
<p>including a programme of interview” while discouraging the US Administration </p>
<p>from putting such pressure on him that he “denounces them and/or resigns”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>making “maximum efforts to find a smoking gun”, ideally “a top level defector … </p>
<p>willing to testify publicly about Saddam’s WMD programme. Sir Richard </p>
<p>Dearlove and Mr Tenet were “on the case”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building up “the dossier on Saddam’s pattern of deception and obstruction, </p>
<p>eg pieces of intelligence showing that he is moving equipment around, has </p>
<p>destroyed documentation, etc”; and</p>

<p>48</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“consider an early, steadying phone call from you to Bush; and pencil in a </p>
<p>January meeting between you.”</p>
<p><b>260. </b> During a meeting with Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce to discuss military planning on </p>
<p>11 December (see Section 6.1), Sir David Manning and Sir Richard Dearlove also </p>
<p>briefed Mr Blair on their recent visits to Washington and “on UK attempts to secure </p>
<p>credible evidence that the Iraqi WMD declaration was false.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>261. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… said that we needed to analyse the Iraqi declaration, ask pointed questions </p>
<p>about issues which the declaration failed to deal with … encourage Blix to ask these </p>
<p>questions of the Iraqis too, and continue to work on securing credible evidence that </p>
<p>Saddam was pursuing WMD programmes.”</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Mr Blair would speak to President Bush and possibly Dr Blix in the next few days.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:</p>
<p>“C [Sir Richard Dearlove] and David Manning were just back from the US and </p>
<p>they reported the mood there was far tougher. They [the US] felt Saddam was just </p>
<p>messing about and that Blix was hopeless and too soft.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>264. </b> In preparation for a conversation with President Bush, Mr Stephen Pattison, Head </p>
<p>of the FCO United Nations Department, provided advice on key messages for Mr Blair.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>265. </b> The FCO messages were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We’re working fast on analysing the declaration and identifying discrepancies </p>
<p>between it and our intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should not rush to a final judgement. It will be worth taking a little time </p>
<p>to build the best possible case against Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would adopt a sceptical tone when Dr Blix briefed the Security Council </p>
<p>on 19 December.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The onus was on Iraq to demonstrate it was co&#8209;operating fully and UNMOVIC </p>
<p>should be encouraged to push hard. Access to information would be crucial.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should help UNMOVIC to identify personnel who might be able to </p>
<p>provide relevant information.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An omission in the declaration would not “by itself” constitute a material breach.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “much more likely that we shall be able to establish a material breach over </p>
<p>time, as we build up a pattern of non&#8209;compliance which is sufficiently serious to </p>

<p>UNMOVIC to keep careful data to establish whether there is a pattern of Iraqi </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It would be important to keep the Security Council united, but that would </p>
<p>“not be easy”.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Cabinet on 12 December was told that the Security Council had decided that Iraq’s </p>
<p>declaration had to be scrutinised before it was made available to a wider audience to </p>
<p>ensure that particularly sensitive information had been excised.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> An initial discussion </p>
<p>of the declaration was expected the following week.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Mr Peter Gooderham, Political Counsellor in the British Embassy Washington, </p>
<p>reported on 12 December that a US official had told him that he expected the US </p>
<p>Administration to decide “probably sometime in mid&#8209;January, to lay it on the line that Iraq </p>
<p>had ‘one last chance’ to co&#8209;operate”.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> This would be accompanied by “an increasingly </p>
<p>overt military build up from early January”. Additional measures for putting pressure </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein were also being considered. The US Administration was also </p>
<p>considering a public presentation of the evidence against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>268. </b> The letter was seen by Sir David Manning.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff, advised Sir David Manning on </p>
<p>13 December that the Iraqi declaration was “largely based on material already presented </p>
<p>to the UN”, and that:</p>
<p>“There appears to have been no attempt to answer any of the unresolved questions </p>
<p>highlighted by UNSCOM or refute any of the points made in the UK or US </p>
<p>dossiers.”</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>270. </b> The absence of new material was described as “striking, particularly in relation </p>
<p>to the biological weapons programme, where UNSCOM have described previous Iraqi </p>
<p>FFCDs as deficient in all areas”. The DIS had also clarified that Iraq had “only previously </p>
<p>admitted to testing VX in aerial munitions, not to any other weaponisation”.</p>

<p>In relation to prospects for 2007, the paper should “stress the likelihood of </p>
<p>mutation of the threat, and highlight linkages to regional political factors, </p>
<p>particularly in the Middle East”.</p>
<p>The JIC Assessment judged that Al Qaida would continue to attempt mass effect attacks, </p>
<p>and that “Attacks using chemical/biological materials within the next five years are almost </p>
<p>inevitable.”</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>The JIC also judged that Al Qaida might “develop radiological dispersal devices or, less </p>
<p>likely, improvised nuclear devices” and that “Technology, expertise and materiel could be </p>
<p>acquired from state programmes.”</p>
<p>The JIC assessed that “Strong Coalition measures in the campaign against terrorism” </p>
<p>would “further radicalise at least some young Muslims. Many issues could draw large </p>
<p>numbers to the Islamist extremist ideology over the next five years, including US&#8209;led </p>
<p>action against Iraq and a subsequent occupation.”</p>
<p>The Assessment stated: “Major political change in countries like Iraq [... and others] could </p>
<p>place elements of state CBRN programmes at the disposal of Al Qaida.”</p>
<p>The JIC sustained its Assessment that the UK would “remain a priority Al Qaida target”.</p>

<p><b>275. </b> On 15 December, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the Iraqi declaration </p>
<p>and the need for “hard, on&#8209;the&#8209;ground evidence” to secure international support for </p>

<p>92</p>
<p> They also discussed “flood[ing] the zone with intelligence driven </p>

<p>“correctly” made the point that “if you don’t find anything, then there can be no </p>

<p>one this weekend. But studying the Iraqi declaration, it is hard to see how conflict </p>
<p>can be avoided, unless Saddam starts to behave honestly. My sense of Russia and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration was a “sham” which they should expose in the debate in the </p>
<p>Security Council later that week.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We should build up the strongest possible case over the next few weeks. Try </p>
<p>to find the smoking gun. Tough but may not be impossible.” A defector “ready </p>
<p>to give details of Saddam’s WMD programme” would be better than in country </p>
<p>interviews.</p>

<p>“In addition we need to piece together comprehensive picture of Iraqi obstruction </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Do everything possible to maintain international coalition you skilfully built.  </p>
<p>If there is a clear material breach, believe we can get a second resolution …”</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE’S VISIT TO WASHINGTON, DECEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>289.  During a visit to Washington</b> <b>in mid&#8209;December, Sir Richard Dearlove </b></p>
<p><b>emphasised the need for sufficient evidence to make a convincing case that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>had failed to abide by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>290. </b> During a discussion on 15 December, Sir Richard Dearlove told his interlocutor </p>
<p>that his impression from his meeting with Mr Blair on 11 December was that “HMG </p>
<p>would need clear evidence beyond an audit of the Iraqi declaration, to commit to </p>
<p>military action”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Sir Richard reported a view that President Bush was relying on Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>assurances that HMG would be with the US.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> The report sent to Sir David Manning recorded that Sir Richard had discussed the </p>
<p>Iraq declaration and the need for a “road map” setting out the next steps with a number </p>
<p>of US officials.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Sir Richard had told one US official that, in addition to setting out clearly and </p>
<p>persuasively that Iraq had failed to abide by resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… we needed to continue on parallel tracks designed to reinforce the case, and for </p>
<p>HMG, to give the PM sufficient evidence of a breach which the declaration by itself </p>
<p>did not. We needed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a detailed audit of the declaration</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to press the interview issue or force Saddam’s refusal to co&#8209;operate</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to prepare for the release of intelligence to prove deception</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to press on with a rigorous inspection regime absent a ‘silver&#8209;bullet’.”</p>
<p><b>294. </b> Sir Richard had said that “perhaps by the end of January all those elements  </p>
<p>would have produced sufficient evidence to make the convincing case we needed”.  </p>
<p>A “convincing defector or a revealing site inspection” would be preferable, “but we could </p>
<p>not depend on this”. He added later that “success was far from guaranteed”.</p>
<p><b>295. </b> In a separate conversation with another official, Sir Richard Dearlove had said that </p>
<p>he “estimated the chance of a successful operation to produce a defector or a smoking </p>
<p>gun at about 20 percent”.</p>
<p><b>296. </b> In a manuscript comment to Mr Blair, Sir David Manning wrote that “we should </p>
<p>go flat out” to find a defector or evidence in a site inspection.</p>

<p>“We have not yet completed a full analysis. But it is clear, even on a preliminary </p>
<p>assessment, that it is not the full and complete declaration requested … and we </p>
<p>wish to hear the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA.</p>
<p>“There are some obvious omissions … And it seems that Saddam Hussein has </p>
<p>decided to continue the pretence that Iraq has had no WMD programme since </p>
<p>UNSCOM left in 1998.</p>
<p>“This will fool nobody. If Saddam persists in this obvious falsehood, it will become </p>
<p>clear that he has rejected the pathway to peace laid down in resolution 1441.</p>
<p>“… we have always said that we would want the declaration tested by hard </p>
<p>questions and robust inspections. As that process continues, we will complete </p>

<p>PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 18 DECEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>303.  Mr Blair continued to express scepticism about whether Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>would comply with resolution 1441; and to emphasise that the UK would if </b></p>
<p><b>necessary disarm him by force.</b></p>
<p><b>304. </b> During Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on 18 December Mr Iain Duncan </p>
<p>Smith, Leader of the Opposition, asked Mr Blair when the Government would make a </p>
<p>formal response to the Iraqi declaration and whether he agreed that Secretary Powell’s </p>
<p>scepticism was well founded.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> Mr Blair replied that the Government would respond </p>
<p>“shortly after the Christmas break”; “most people” were “pretty sceptical”, but it was </p>
<p>important to study the Iraqi declaration in detail and make a considered response.</p>
<p><b>305. </b> In response to a question from Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal </p>
<p>Democrats, about military deployments, and a reported comment by Mr Hoon that the </p>
<p>Security Council would not be the final judge of whether military action was necessary, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… resolution 1441 assumes that there will be a further discussion in the UN </p>
<p>Security Council … [I]t has always been our desire to act with the full authority of </p>
<p>the … Council. We have always made it clear, however, that, if there were a breach </p>
<p>and if, for any reason, the Security Council were blocked in any way, we do not </p>
<p>believe it right that that breach should go unpunished … [I]t is important to make </p>
<p>sure that we do our level best to work with the UN in any way that we can, but the </p>
<p>bottom line – as I have set out from the very beginning – must be that the United </p>
<p>Nations route must be the way of dealing with the issue, not the way of avoiding </p>
<p>dealing with it … I believe that the UN will support action in circumstances where </p>
<p>there has been a breach.”</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>306. </b> Mr Kennedy also asked if the Government would back the US if it decided to take </p>
<p>any “pre&#8209;emptive unilateral action” before the UN inspectorate had completed its task </p>
<p>and submitted its conclusions and recommendations to the Security Council. Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that the US was “bound by the UN resolution, just as we are”, and reiterated </p>
<p>the points he had made to the <i>Financial Times</i> on 10 December about the nature of the </p>
<p>“deal” in resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>307. </b> Subsequently, in response to a question from Mr Andrew Selous (Conservative) </p>
<p>asking for a “clearer explanation” of whether the purpose of a “possible war” in Iraq </p>
<p>was “to protect Iraq’s citizens and neighbours from Saddam, to enhance UN authority, </p>
<p>or to protect Britain from a future missile attack or Iraqi&#8209;sponsored terrorism, Mr Blair </p>
<p>responded that those factors were not “mutually inconsistent”:</p>
<p>“The reasons for being prepared to take action … are, first, that Saddam has </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction that threaten his region … if a conflict took place </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>there involving weapons of mass destruction, it is unthinkable that we would not be </p>
<p>involved in some way, as we were 10 years ago.</p>
<p>“Secondly, it is important because there is a UN resolution … that Saddam must </p>
<p>give up those weapons … [I]f … we were to allow Saddam to breach the UN will </p>
<p>and did nothing about it, the consequences would be felt not just in respect of Iraq. </p>
<p>We would send a message across the world that this was a serious issue, but one </p>
<p>about which we were prepared to do nothing … We are members of the international </p>
<p>community and we believe it is important that Britain make sure that Saddam </p>
<p>complies with those UN resolutions. That is why Britain has a vital national interest in </p>
<p>ensuring that the resolution is implemented.”</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>MR HOON’S STATEMENT, 18 DECEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>308.  Mr Hoon told Parliament on 18 December that the UK was making </b></p>
<p><b>contingency preparations, including the deployment of a naval Task Group </b></p>
<p><b>for exercises; and that there might be additional maritime deployments in the </b></p>
<p><b>New Year.</b></p>
<p><b>309. </b> In a statement to Parliament on 18 December on contingency preparations for </p>
<p>military operations against Iraq, Mr Hoon reported that he had “authorised a range of </p>
<p>steps to improve readiness”.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> He also referred to the planned deployment of a naval </p>
<p>Task Group, led by HMS Ark Royal, to the Gulf and Asia&#8209;Pacific region, in early 2003, </p>
<p>which remained “available for a range of potential operations if required”.</p>
<p><b>310. </b> Mr Hoon added that the UK was also considering the deployment of “additional </p>
<p>maritime forces early in the new year to ensure the readiness of a broad range of </p>
<p>maritime capabilities, should they be required”.</p>

<p><b>317. </b> Comments recorded in the minutes of the discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “no significant disagreements of perception or judgement </p>
<p>between the UK and the US”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration was “surprisingly bad”; virtually none of the issues arising from </p>
<p>the 1999 UNSCOM report had been answered.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further analysis of the annexes “would be an enormous job”, and the UK “would </p>
<p>have to rely upon seeing the UN translation of much of the Arabic material”.  </p>
<p>That text was “unlikely to contain the missing information”.</p>

<p><b>320. </b> The key elements of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 18 December 2002: ‘An Initial Assessment </b></p>
<p><b>of Iraq’s WMD Declaration’</b></p>
<p>The Assessment rehearsed the UK’s knowledge of Iraq’s production of WMD before 1991 </p>
<p>and the material which UNSCOM had been “unable to account for”, and the judgements </p>
<p>in the September dossier.</p>
<p><b>Intelligence on the declaration</b></p>
<p>“Intelligence indicated in early November that Iraq was considering a number of options … </p>
<p>including a possible admission of a small proportion of its illegal activity. But by late </p>
<p>November intelligence indicated that Iraq’s declaration would omit references to its </p>
<p>banned weapons and that the aim was to overload UNMOVIC with information.” A senior </p>
<p>Iraqi official was quoted as saying “the declaration would be general and lacking in detail </p>
<p>and had been padded out with various scientific reports and studies”.</p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>The declaration was “largely based on material already presented to the UN in </p>
<p>previous FFCDs [Full, Final, and Complete Declarations] and other correspondence”. </p>
<p>“No serious attempt” had “apparently been made to answer any of the unresolved </p>
<p>questions highlighted by UNSCOM or to refute any of the points made in the UK dossier”. </p>
<p>Iraq continued to “claim that it has not conducted any illicit WMD or ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes since 1991”. “Little new material … on the nuclear, chemical or biological </p>
<p>weapons” had been found; there was “some new material” on missiles.</p>
<p><b>Chemical weapons</b></p>
<p>The declaration was based on a June 1996 FFCD and additional information provided to </p>
<p>the UN before 1998. Some of that information had not been seen previously by the UK. </p>
<p>As well as the “unaccounted for” quantities of agent, precursors and munitions which </p>
<p>UNSCOM had identified, the declaration did not:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“provide a key document detailing the consumption of special munitions in the </p>
<p>1980s” which had been “removed from UNSCOM by the Iraqis”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“substantiate Iraq’s denials … that attempts were made to manufacture and </p>
<p>weaponise VX”.</p>
<p>The list of “over 30 sites in which chemical activity” took place was “incomplete”.</p>
<p><b>Biological weapons</b></p>
<p>The declaration reiterated information already provided to the UN, which had already been </p>
<p>reviewed. It failed to “provide a technically coherent account of Iraq’s biological weapons </p>
<p>programme”. The declaration provided new material relating to 40 sites which Iraq claimed </p>
<p>had no connection with proscribed activity but which were judged capable of supporting </p>
<p>a BW programme. It did not mention some dual&#8209;use sites previously monitored by </p>
<p>UNSCOM. Names of individuals included in previous declarations on biological weapons </p>

<p>“provided to UNMOVIC on request”.</p>
<p>It did not:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“address the issue of unaccounted for growth media”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“provide fully documented accounts” of the pre&#8209;1991 programmes or “recognition </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“acknowledge any proscribed biological weapons activity post&#8209;1991”; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“mention … transportable production facilities”.</p>
<p><b>Nuclear weapons</b></p>
<p>The declaration was “largely the same as the FFCD” for activity pre&#8209;1991 which had been </p>
<p>issued in 1998, “with a new extended summary”. It was “accurate” but “incomplete”. It </p>
<p>maintained that no weapons&#8209;related work had been undertaken since 1998. It did not </p>
<p>address whether Iraq had been seeking uranium in Africa.</p>
<p><b>Ballistic missiles</b></p>
<p>Most of the data provided related to pre&#8209;1991 programmes. The declaration acknowledged </p>
<p>“some facilities established since 1998” and “known from intelligence”. It also provided </p>
<p>“some limited new evidence of proscribed missile development post&#8209;1991”. Two designs </p>
<p>were judged to have ranges greater than the limit of 150km.</p>
<p>The “major omissions” were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no attempt to resolve outstanding issues” relating to SCUD missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no mention of any post&#8209;1998 activity at many missile related facilities, including </p>
<p>the al&#8209;Rafah engine test stand”, which was “capable of testing engines for missiles </p>
<p>with ranges over 1000km”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no details of recent procurement activity associated with more advanced missile </p>
<p>propellant”.</p>
<p><b>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration referred to “aborted attempts” to convert an anti&#8209;ship missile into </p>
<p>a land attack weapon with a range of 95km. The JIC judged the “system would be </p>
<p>suitable for chemical and biological delivery”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration claimed that the L&#8209;29 aircraft was “a target&#8209;drone” and there “was </p>
<p>no mention of a chemical or biological agent delivery capability”. The JIC judged </p>
<p>that Iraq had “more aircraft” and had “conducted more flight tests than stated”; and </p>
<p>that its range was “understated”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration provided “limited, but new information on two UAV programmes”, </p>
<p>which Iraq claimed had “started after 1998”, that had been included in reports </p>
<p>recently passed to UNMOVIC. They would be “used as target drones”. The JIC </p>
<p>judged that the UAVs “would have a significantly better performance” than claimed </p>
<p>and could be “adapted to chemical and biological agent delivery”.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The JIC concluded that the declaration so far analysed failed to address the outstanding </p>
<p>issues from UNSCOM’s report to the Security Council in 1999 and “made no attempt to </p>
<p>answer any of the points outlined in the UK dossier”. Iraq might:</p>
<p>“… feel they dealt with these points in their previous rebuttal of the dossier. Some of </p>
<p>the deficiencies may be addressed in the parts yet to be translated, but this does not </p>
<p>look likely.”</p>
<p><b>321. </b> On 20 December, Mr Miller sent Sir David Manning a further DIS overview of the </p>

<p><b>322. </b> Mr Miller re&#8209;stated the key findings outlined in the 18 December JIC Assessment </p>
<p>and identified the principal areas of apparent omission. The main new points identified </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an admission by the Iraqis that they have delivered 50 Al Samoud missiles to </p>
<p>their military. The UK dossier stated that at least 50 of these missiles had been </p>
<p>produced and were being deployed to military units;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>details of missile related procurement activities post&#8209;1998, which Iraq claims </p>
<p>were for permitted programmes. There are no details concerning the origin of </p>
<p>the material and equipment procured, some of which we judge were obtained </p>
<p>illicitly;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the document fails to cover refurbishment at potential BW sites.”</p>

<p>6 December had not changed, “especially that nothing short of a massive Coalition force </p>
<p>was guaranteed to threaten the regime enough to topple it”. There were, however, “more </p>
<p>areas of pressure building within the regime, although it was still impossible to say how </p>
<p>and when it might fracture”. The Iraqi people’s perceptions of Saddam Hussein’s position </p>
<p>would be “crucial”. The two “tipping points” would be when:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“people decided that they would be better off without Saddam”; and</p>

<p>“they decided that he had finally lost control”.</p>

<p><b>Meeting of the US National Security Council, </b></p>
<p><b>18 December 2002</b></p>
<p>In his memoir, <i>War and Decision</i>, Mr Douglas Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense for </p>
<p>Policy, described a meeting of the US National Security Council on 18 December 2002, </p>
<p>at which the US response to Iraq’s declaration was discussed.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Mr Feith described differences of view between President Bush and other members of </p>
<p>the Council about the position the US Administration should adopt in response to the </p>
<p>discussion of the Iraqi declaration of 7 December in the Security Council on 19 December, </p>
<p>and the impact which describing the declaration as a material breach of resolution 1441 </p>
<p>would have.</p>
<p>Mr Feith reported that, after some discussion, President Bush stated that he thought “war </p>
<p>was inevitable”. President Bush was concerned that use of the term material breach would </p>
<p>create an expectation of military action and a debate about whether it was sufficient for the </p>
<p>US to go to war.</p>
<p>Secretary Powell was reported to have taken a different position; and that he had </p>
<p>suggested the US should make its case to the Security Council that Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>not co&#8209;operating soon after Dr Blix’s report on 27 January 2003.</p>
<p>Mr Feith reported that President Bush had reminded those in the room that the point of the </p>
<p>7 December declaration was to test whether Saddam would accept the “final opportunity” </p>
<p>for peace offered by the Security Council; and that he had summed up the discussion by </p>
<p>stating:</p>
<p>“We’ve got what we need now, to show America that Saddam won’t disarm himself.”</p>
<p><b>Cabinet, 19 December 2002</b></p>
<p><b>327.  In his update to Cabinet on 19 December, Mr Straw suggested that the </b></p>
<p><b>Iraqi declaration did not meet the requirements of resolution 1441 and that the </b></p>
<p><b>next step would be increased efforts by the inspectors to find the evidence. </b></p>
<p><b>The Security Council could be in a position to declare a material breach by </b></p>
<p><b>27 January 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>328.  Mr Hoon informed Cabinet that preparations were being made to be ready for </b></p>
<p><b>possible military action.</b></p>
<p><b>329.  Mr Blair promised that there would be an “opportunity to discuss Iraq in the </b></p>
<p><b>New Year”.</b></p>
<p><b>330. </b> Mr Straw reported to Cabinet on 19 December that Iraq’s declaration did not look </p>
<p>as “accurate, full and complete as the resolution required”; and that, in particular, it failed </p>
<p>to explain the material which had been “unaccounted for in 1998 such as: 360 tonnes </p>
<p>of bulk chemical warfare agent; 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals; growth media </p>

<p>biological agents”.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>331. </b> Mr Straw reminded his colleagues that a false statement did not represent a </p>
<p>material breach, “but it could be a contributing factor”. The next step would be increased </p>
<p>efforts by the inspectors to find the evidence. The inspectors had to report to the UN </p>
<p>Security Council on progress by 27 January. By that time, “the Security Council could be </p>
<p>in a position to declare a material breach”. President Bush would be making his State of </p>
<p>the Union speech on 28 January.</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Mr Hoon informed his colleagues that, “to be ready for possible military action”, </p>
<p>it was “increasingly necessary to make visible preparations. Contracts for equipment </p>
<p>would be let; Reservists and their employers would be consulted; the notice to move </p>
<p>for some units would be reduced; and a naval Task Group led by HMS Ark Royal </p>
<p>would depart for exercises.” The US had not yet finalised its military planning but it was </p>
<p>“already building up a formidable force and would be ready to use it”.</p>
<p><b>333. </b> Mr Blair said that “there would be an opportunity to discuss Iraq in the New Year”.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Ms Clare Short, the International </p>
<p>Development Secretary, had pointed up the need for more discussion on Iraq.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>Security Council, 19 December 2002</b></p>
<p><b>335.  In response to a briefing from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on 19 December, the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council agreed to a further discussion early the following month, after </b></p>
<p><b>members of the Council had completed their analytical work.</b></p>
<p><b>336. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported overnight on 17/18 December that Dr Blix would </p>
<p>tell the Security Council on 19 December that it could not have confidence that the </p>
<p>declaration “disposed of” the question of Iraq’s WMD holdings but that he could not say </p>
<p>Iraq definitely had WMD; there was more work to do and the ball was in Iraq’s court.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>337. </b> On 17 and 18 December, Secretary Powell and Mr Straw discussed the pressure </p>
<p>on the US Administration to say “something strong” (in response to Dr Blix’s briefing to </p>
<p>Members of the Security Council) and the need to catch Iraq “red&#8209;handed”.</p>

<p>63</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Dr Blix reported on the speed of UNMOVIC’s build&#8209;up of operations in Iraq and </p>
<p>that it had inspected 44 sites, including eight newly declared locations.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> Access to the </p>
<p>sites, including those previously designated by Iraq as sensitive or Presidential, had </p>
<p>been “prompt”, and assistance had been “expeditious”. The location of artillery shells </p>
<p>and containers with mustard gas, which had been placed under UNSCOM supervision </p>
<p>in 1998, had been identified and they would be sampled and eventually destroyed. </p>
<p>Dr Blix reported that Iraq had formally been asked to submit the names of all personnel </p>
<p>currently or formerly associated with some aspect of Iraq’s programme of weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and ballistic missiles by the end of the year; and for legislation </p>
<p>implementing resolutions, notably laws prohibiting engagement in the development, </p>
<p>production or storage of proscribed material.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> In his “necessarily provisional” comments on the declaration, Dr Blix stated that </p>
<p>Iraq continued to state that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when </p>
<p>the inspectors left in December 1998 and that none had “been designed, procured, </p>
<p>produced or stored in the period since then”. While individual Governments had stated </p>
<p>that they had “convincing evidence to the contrary”, UNMOVIC was, at that point, </p>
<p>“neither in a position to confirm Iraq’s statements, nor in possession of evidence to </p>
<p>disprove it”.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> During the period between 1991 and 1998, Iraq had submitted many declarations </p>
<p>which had “proved inaccurate or incomplete or was unsupported or contradicted by </p>
<p>evidence”. The statements by Iraq were not sufficient to create confidence that no </p>
<p>weapons programmes and proscribed items remained: the statements needed to be </p>
<p>“supported by documentation or other evidence” which would allow them to be verified.</p>
<p><b>342. </b> The overall impression was that “not much new significant information” </p>
<p>had been provided which related to proscribed programmes; nor had “much new </p>
<p>supporting documentation or other evidence been submitted”. Iraq had provided </p>
<p>new information on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>missile activities, including a series of new projects at various stages of </p>
<p>development, which Iraq claimed were permitted;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a short&#8209;range rocket manufactured using 81mm aluminium tubes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “Air Force” document</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> relating to the consumption of chemical weapons </p>
<p>in the Iran&#8209;Iraq war.</p>
<p>New material had been provided “concerning non&#8209;weapons related activities”.</p>

<p>Hans Blix, Executive Chairman UNMOVIC’.</p>
<p>119 </p>
<p>A document found by an UNSCOM inspector in a safe in Iraqi Air Force headquarters in 1998. It gave </p>
<p>an account of the expenditure of bombs, including chemical bombs, by Iraq in the Iran&#8209;Iraq war which </p>
<p>raised questions about Iraq’s previous accounts. Iraq had taken the document from the inspector.</p>

<p>64</p>
<p><b>343. </b> There were also inconsistencies and areas which needed clarification, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the omission of information on imports of bacterial growth media;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>declaration of the development of a variant of the Al Samoud missile which had </p>
<p>exceeded the permitted range in test flights; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a lack of supporting evidence to address unresolved issues identified in the 1999 </p>
<p>UNSCOM and Amorim reports.</p>
<p><b>344. </b> In conclusion, Dr Blix stated that, if Iraq failed to provide evidence supporting its </p>
<p>statements, the inspectors could not guarantee that all possibly concealed items and </p>
<p>activities would be found; but they would make attempts at concealment more difficult.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> A statement by the President of the Council said that the members had noted the </p>
<p>contents of the briefing and expressed their intention to have a further discussion “early </p>
<p>in January after all members of the Council finish their own analytical work” and more </p>
<p>regular briefings from UNMOVIC and the IAEA.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>346. </b> In his remarks to the Security Council, Sir Jeremy Greenstock drew on the </p>
<p>statement issued by Mr Straw on 18 December. He gave examples of weapons and </p>
<p>materials which had not been accounted for in the declaration and added that:</p>
<p>“The declaration fell well short of providing compelling evidence that Iraq wishes to </p>
<p>establish a new co&#8209;operative relationship with UNMOVIC and the Council. On the </p>
<p>contrary, it suggested that Iraq had no intention of complying with SCR 1441, or </p>
<p>taking the pathway to peace laid down in that resolution. We wanted to see … the </p>
<p>discrepancies probed rigorously … In short, we were very disappointed that Iraq had </p>
<p>not taken the 1441 opportunity. I would not speculate what this meant. But Iraq now </p>
<p>had to be 100 percent pro&#8209;active in co&#8209;operating with the inspectors in accounting </p>
<p>for every remaining doubt. Withholding this quality of co&#8209;operation risked bringing </p>
<p>into play the second part of OP4 of 1441.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>347. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock also reported that Dr ElBaradei had appealed to Member </p>
<p>States to offer whatever information they had to assist UNMOVIC and the IAEA in </p>
<p>reaching credible conclusions on Iraq’s weapons programmes.</p>
<p><b>348. </b> Sir Jeremy described the meeting as a “surprisingly low key affair, largely because </p>
<p>the non&#8209;permanents had only had the declaration for 36 hours”. Some of them were </p>
<p>insisting that they see the un&#8209;excised version.</p>
<p><b>349. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had told the press that there was little new </p>
<p>evidence in the declaration and what was new generally related to non&#8209;weapons </p>
<p>programmes. Iraq was co&#8209;operating on process but much more was needed on </p>

<p>Iraq had missed an opportunity in its declaration, but could still provide information.</p>

<p>to UNMOVIC but “We had not found a silver bullet yet.”</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>352.  Mr Straw issued a statement which said that the declaration failed to meet </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s obligations and that there could not, therefore, be any confidence in Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>claims that it had no WMD.</b></p>
<p><b>353. </b> In a statement issued after the reports to the Security Council, Mr Straw said that </p>
<p>they showed:</p>
<p>“… clearly that Iraq has failed to meet the obligations imposed on it by Security </p>
<p>Council resolution 1441, which requires them to make a full and complete disclosure </p>
<p>of their weapons of mass destruction … as Dr Blix has said, this means that we </p>
<p>cannot have confidence … to put it very mildly – that Iraq has no weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction as it has claimed. This now means that Iraq faces even greater </p>
<p>responsibilities to comply fully with the inspectors and co&#8209;operate fully with the </p>
<p>United Nations if military action is to be avoided. This disclosure does not of itself </p>
<p>trigger military action … but it is a very serious failure to comply, and a clear warning </p>
<p>has to go out to Iraq that they now have to co&#8209;operate fully with the United Nations </p>
<p>and its inspectors as is required of them by international law.”</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>354.  Secretary Powell warned that Iraq was “well on its way to losing its last </b></p>
<p><b>chance”, and that there was a “practical limit” to how long the inspectors could </b></p>
<p><b>be given to complete their work.</b></p>
<p><b>355. </b> Secretary Powell gave a press conference on 19 December stating that the Iraqi </p>
<p>declaration did not address Iraq’s stockpiles or supplies of chemical and biological </p>
<p>agents and the procurement and use of high&#8209;strength aluminium tubes that can be used </p>
<p>in a nuclear weapons programme: “Most brazenly of all, the Iraqi declaration denies </p>

<p>audit and examine the Iraqi declaration “to understand the full extent of Iraq’s </p>
<p>failure to meet its disclosure obligations”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>conduct interviews with scientists and other witnesses outside Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intensify UN inspectors’ efforts inside Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consult the Security Council and US allies on how to compel Iraq to comply with </p>
<p>the terms of the resolution.</p>
<p><b>357. </b> Secretary Powell stated that the United States, and he hoped other Council </p>
<p>members, would “provide the inspectors with every possible assistance, all the support </p>
<p>they need to succeed in their crucial mission”. Resolution 1441 had called for “serious </p>
<p>consequences for Iraq” if it did not comply. So far, Iraq was “well on its way to losing its </p>
<p>last chance”. There was “no calendar deadline”, but there was “a practical limit to how </p>
<p>much longer you can just go down the road of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation and how much time the </p>
<p>inspectors can be given to do their work … This situation cannot continue.”</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell had spoken before the press conference about </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s remarks on the<i> BBC</i>’s <i>Today</i> programme earlier that day. Mr Straw said </p>
<p>that he had “repeated [the] long standing position that [the UK] would prefer a second </p>
<p>resolution, with the usual Kosovo caveats”.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>359. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell also discussed the need for the White House </p>
<p>to be clear about Mr Blair’s position.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> In a letter to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary, Mr Ehrman wrote:</p>
<p>“With the American military machine now increasingly set on auto&#8209;pilot towards war, </p>
<p>the nightmare scenario of the UK having to decide whether to join US military action </p>
<p>without a second SCR is only made more likely …”</p>

<p><b>361. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer reported on 19 December that there was “some fairly </p>

<p>What did Tony Blair need to be able comfortably to go to war?”.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> The current US view </p>
<p>“which could change, was that a second SCR was attainable”. Sir Christopher had told </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Mr Campbell argued that the communications strategy “should be rooted in where </p>
<p>we think we will end up which currently looks like a military conflict that ends in Saddam </p>
<p>falling”. The major steps and key messages envisaged by Mr Campbell were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s declaration would be “shown to be false – requires strategy which … </p>
<p>emphasises our determination to ensure Saddam Hussein understands … this is </p>
<p>his last chance and that we are trying our hardest to make the process work … </p>
<p>We need to guard against the sense that we are looking for the process to fail, </p>
<p>rather than looking for the process to succeed;”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “UN discussion” where the tone would be one of “regret that he [Saddam] </p>
<p>failed to take the chance” and with the “UK at heart of coalition building around </p>
<p>key arguments”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “Military build up” which moved from the “current argument that ‘sometimes the </p>
<p>only way to avoid conflict is by making it clear willing to use force if necessary’ </p>
<p>to ‘we did not want war, but Saddam Hussein has rejected the peaceful path to </p>
<p>disarmament’”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Military conflict: This is the last resort. Now we need to get the job done”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Post conflict: We’re there to help for the long term.”</p>
<p><b>371. </b> A “specific communications plan for the Iraqi people” was being developed which </p>
<p>would emphasise Iraq’s territorial integrity and make it clear that “we are gunning for </p>
<p>Saddam’s people at the top, not the ‘ordinary’ people”. In Mr Campbell’s view they would </p>
<p>“actually prefer a ‘regime change’ message to a more subtle ‘disarmament’ message”.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Mr Campbell argued that the UK needed a “clear sense of a UK Government </p>
<p>position that is our own … not merely an echo” of the US position and counter the sense </p>
<p>that the UK was acting for America. The UK had to “communicate better the threat and </p>
<p>relevance to the UK”. The UK position “should be that the issue of Iraq/WMD has to be </p>
<p>addressed, we worked hard to get [the] UN route … and we’re working hard to make that </p>
<p>route work. But Saddam has to understand this is his last chance, and in the meantime </p>
<p>we carry on military preparations.”</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the US tone was “dismissive” on inspections; the UK had </p>
<p>to be deliberative. The UK needed to “set out our own definition of material breach. </p>
<p>The closest we have is Jack [Straw]’s statement that ‘material breach means something </p>
<p>significant: some behaviour or pattern of behaviour which is serious’”. In Mr Campbell’s </p>
<p>view, the media confused “material breach and trigger”.</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Other points made by Mr Campbell were that the UK needed to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… rebut the ‘poodle charge’ by answering more clearly the questions – Why </p>
<p>Iraq? Why now? And why us?”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… put over to the public” that we are in charge of our military preparations, </p>
<p>separate from the Americans, “though obviously linked”. The fact that the US/UK </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>had hugely superior military was likely to have the most impact on Iraqi opinion </p>
<p>“so we have agreed MOD should step up their military preparedness briefing”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>rebut negative stories, including the “charge that the conflict is all about oil”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… make more of the issue of WMD more generally, and make the link (largely </p>
<p>unbelieved here or in the US) with terrorism. It is a theoretical link, not yet an </p>
<p>actual one, and the US, in continuing to make claims of an actual link, risk being </p>
<p>counter productive”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>have “better answers to the charge of double standards re Israel, which is the </p>
<p>single biggest impediment to effective communications in the region”.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Mr Campbell concluded that there was “a big job of work to do” which would </p>
<p>“require a lot of input” from Mr Blair and set out a list of potential communications </p>
<p>opportunities in January.</p>
<p><b>376. </b> Mr Campbell also set out the arrangements he had put in place to “implement </p>
<p>a major communications strategy, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a weekly strategy meeting;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>daily reviews;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>daily US conference calls;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CIC [Communications and Information Centre] reactivated;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>excellent output by the Islamic Media Unit;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a small but effective presence in Amman (media route to Baghdad); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>good co&#8209;operation with the Agencies.”</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Campbell also sent Mr Blair an “agreed Iraq strategy document”, advising </p>
<p>him that it showed “a lot of work has been done, and we have the outlines of a good </p>
<p>communications strategy”.</p>
<p><b>The absence of a “smoking gun”</b></p>
<p><b>378.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell on 30 December that the US and UK should </b></p>
<p><b>develop a clear “plan B” postponing military action</b> <b>on the basis that inspections </b></p>
<p><b>plus the threat of force was containing Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>379. </b> On 24 December, Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that the UK was:</p>
<p>“… clear that a second resolution should be sought if justified. Such an approach </p>
<p>was essential from the point of view of UK politics. Although we had not sought or </p>
<p>received definitive legal advice, I thought it would be hard going with our Attorney </p>
<p>General if there were no second resolution. It would be especially difficult for us </p>
<p>without a second resolution except in a ‘Kosovo&#8209;equivalent situation’ (where we had </p>
<p>a majority in the Security Council but were vetoed by one P5 Member only).”</p>

<p>70</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed again the importance of Mr Blair making </p>
<p>that point when he next spoke to President Bush. They also discussed that it would be </p>
<p>hard to see how there could be a second resolution, and even harder to justify military </p>
<p>action, if the inspectors failed to find anything.</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke twice on 30 December. In their first </p>
<p>conversation, they discussed the possibility that the military would be ready to take </p>
<p>action but there would be no casus belli.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>382. </b> In their second conversation Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the </p>
<p>likelihood that, when the UN inspectors reported to the Security Council on 27 January, </p>
<p>they would report that they needed more time to complete their work.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>383. </b> Mr Straw said it was:</p>
<p>“… perfectly possible that a clear casus belli could have been presented by </p>
<p>27 January, in which case we would get a second resolution and military action </p>
<p>would go ahead. But there was a sufficient possibility that we would not be in that </p>
<p>position. We should therefore develop a clear ‘plan B’ for the President and the </p>
<p>Prime Minister in which military action was postponed on the basis that inspections </p>
<p>plus the threat of force was containing Saddam.”</p>

<p>71</p>
<p><b>Advice for Mr Blair in early January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>385.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair on 3 January 2003 that there was an urgent need </b></p>
<p><b>to lower expectations that military action against Iraq was inevitable.</b></p>
<p><b>386.  The UK should emphasise that the preferred strategy was peaceful </b></p>
<p><b>disarmament and that decisions would not be taken at the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>on 27 January.</b></p>
<p><b>387.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell’s view was that it would be rash to bank on </b></p>
<p><b>an assumption that the inspectors’ reports to the Security Council on 27 January </b></p>
<p><b>would provide grounds to trigger a further meeting of the Security Council and </b></p>
<p><b>a resolution authorising the use of force.</b></p>
<p><b>388.  There was a need for private discussions with the US on the strategy in the </b></p>
<p><b>event that the inspections failed to produce an “early and large smoking gun”.</b></p>
<p><b>389.  Mr Straw’s view was that a peaceful solution was, on balance, more likely </b></p>
<p><b>than conflict.</b></p>
<p><b>390. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 3 January 2003 about the need urgently to lower </p>
<p>public expectations, in the UK and abroad, that:</p>
<p>“… the die will be cast at the Security Council meeting on 27 January. If we are not </p>
<p>careful, the necessary military build up will allow the media to set us up for a fall … </p>
<p>when and if the out come … is far from an authorisation for war. Your speech to the </p>
<p>Diplomatic Service Conference on Tuesday [7 January] is therefore very important </p>
<p>in setting the scene for the next three weeks.”</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“… a lot of effort is being made by the … agencies to provide Blix and ElBaradei </p>
<p>[with leads drawing on intelligence reports] … to enable them to upgrade their </p>
<p>inspections over the next three weeks. It is possible that this will produce a big </p>
<p>smoking gun, sufficient for Blix and ElBaradei to point in their 27 January report to </p>
<p>a breach of obligation by Iraq sufficient to trigger OPs 11 and 12 of [resolution] 1441, </p>
<p>a further meeting of the Security Council, and a resolution authorising the use of </p>
<p>force … But, in my view (shared by Powell) it would be rash to bank on this. So far, </p>
<p>reality has not matched the expectation generated by the intelligence …</p>
<p>“Scenarios just as likely as a clear material breach by 27 January are:</p>
<p>(i) </p>
<p>an indication from Blix/El&#8209;Baradei that they have been broadly satisfied </p>
<p>with the level of co&#8209;operation by Iraq, and have so far found nothing of </p>
<p>any significance but will continue looking;</p>

<p>concerns by them of some lack of co&#8209;operation, and in respect of some </p>
<p>of their finds, but in neither case adding up to a casus belli to satisfy a </p>
<p>majority on the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>392. </b> Mr Straw suggested the UK’s messages should be:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to emphasise that our preferred strategy continues to be … disarmament </p>
<p>by peaceful means, through the UN system;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the 27 January meeting is not and never has been a decision deadline …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whatever the inspectors say to the 27 January meeting, decisions, particularly </p>
<p>on military action, would not be taken then.”</p>
<p><b>393. </b> Mr Straw warned Mr Blair that the UK would be “faced with the argument that the </p>
<p>finds prove that inspection is working: we will be told to let them continue and destroy </p>
<p>what they find rather than going to war”.</p>
<p><b>394. </b> Mr Straw suggested that the UK needed “to discuss very privately with the </p>
<p>Americans over the next few weeks our strategy if inspections produce no early and </p>
<p>large smoking gun”. The purpose would be to explore whether the US could or would </p>
<p>maintain the position of continuing inspections and a military build&#8209;up at a high state </p>
<p>of readiness “for weeks or even months”.</p>
<p><b>395. </b> Mr Straw stated that there were signs that President Bush recognised that going </p>
<p>to war “without a publicly convincing trigger, and without a second UNSCR, could well </p>
<p>be politically worse for him … as well as acutely difficult for us”. Secretary Powell had </p>
<p>told Mr Straw that “if there was an insufficient case for a second resolution, there would </p>
<p>equally be an insufficient case for the US to go unilateral”.</p>
<p><b>396. </b> Mr Straw offered to discuss the issues with Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>397. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Straw had:</p>
<p>“… called me a couple of times over the holiday and emphasised the importance </p>
<p>of TB [Mr Blair] not positioning himself so that no war looked like failure.”</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>398. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that in “very early January [2003] he had bumped in to </p>
<p>two journalists” who had asked about the odds of avoiding war, and that he had replied </p>
<p>“60/40”.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> That reply then “found its way into the newspapers”. Mr Straw stated that </p>
<p>he had formed that “provisional judgement” from his own reading of the Iraqi regime’s </p>
<p>behaviour:</p>
<p>“… by its own terms it acted with some rationality. I could not believe that, faced with </p>
<p>the near certainty of military action if it failed to comply with 1441, the regime could </p>

<p>fail to appreciate that its very survival depended on full compliance, and that this </p>
<p>would be relatively straightforward for them to prove – unless they had something </p>
<p>terrifying to hide. In the event, however, my optimism proved unfounded.”</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Asked to explain the basis for his optimism, Mr Straw responded in his statement </p>
<p>for the Inquiry in January 2011 that:</p>
<p>“… a key foundation … was that the United States had committed itself to dealing </p>
<p>with Saddam by working through the United Nations …</p>
<p>“This was coupled to emerging evidence that, while by no means sufficiently, the </p>
<p>inspectors were beginning to make some progress …</p>
<p>“Additionally, there were indications from the United States that it was moving closer </p>
<p>to committing itself to going for a second resolution. My optimism at the time was </p>
<p>therefore also in part based on the hope of a unified Security Council position, in </p>
<p>the form of a second resolution. I believed at the time, and I still believe today, that </p>
<p>confronting Saddam Hussein with this clear united position from the international </p>
<p>community … would have presented us with the best way to deal with Iraq </p>
<p>peacefully.”</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Mr Straw confirmed that he was aware that Mr Blair was more sceptical than he </p>
<p>was, but in early 2003 his instinct was more optimistic that there would be compliance.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Mr Straw wrote in his memoir that he “wanted to pull back on the idea of a ‘rush </p>
<p>to war’ and in particular avoid Hans Blix’s next report, due on 27 January, being the </p>
<p>decisive moment”. At the beginning of 2003, he was “optimistic about a peaceful </p>
<p>resolution” and, when he had been asked about “the odds of avoiding war” by journalists </p>
<p>from <i>The Times </i>and the <i>Sun </i>on 3 January, he had replied “Sixty/forty”.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>402.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that the US was close to giving up hope </b></p>

<p>strength at Christmas … The inspectors needed targeted support; and time to build </p>
<p>up operating skills. Even so, it’s true that the chances of them finding a smoking gun </p>
<p>are relatively small which is why we need a defector if we can get one. But this too, </p>
<p>needs time.</p>
<p>“The Americans are in a hurry; perhaps too much of one. This colours their </p>
<p>approach to UNMOVIC and makes them impatient … Too much looks like hurried </p>
<p>improvisation, half thought out strategy, with fingers crossed that Saddam will </p>
<p>collapse in short order …”</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Sir David concluded that there was a danger of the US being driven by the tempo </p>
<p>of the military build&#8209;up and understandable preference to fight in the spring not the </p>
<p>summer. In his view, “more time” was needed “to build the case against Saddam and </p>
<p>improve the odds for a second resolution”.</p>
<p><b>407. </b> In a manuscript note on Mr Straw’s letter of 3 January, Sir David Manning told </p>
<p>Mr Blair that Washington was “aware of the pitfalls and thinking in terms of a second </p>
<p>resolution”.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>408. </b> Sir David Manning discussed potential developments before Dr Blix’s report to the </p>
<p>Security Council on 27 January with Dr Rice on 3 January. “Emphasising that he was </p>
<p>speaking personally”, he told Dr Rice that he was:</p>
<p>“… convinced that we needed a second resolution; and that we would only get one </p>
<p>if we could produce convincing evidence that Saddam was in breach. Supposition </p>
<p>would not be enough. Apart from the problem of the Security Council, we would not </p>
<p>be able to get endorsement from the House of Commons for military action …”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Sir David suggested the pursuit of a three&#8209;part policy:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>compiling a register of intelligence reports that pointed to specific locations </p>
<p>where Saddam Hussein might be hiding WMD, or documents relevant to </p>
<p>the WMD programme, and trying “to persuade Dr Blix to mount co&#8209;ordinated </p>
<p>surprise inspections [...] It was much too early to assume that the inspection </p>
<p>route would yield nothing”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>urging Dr Blix to state publicly that there were numerous gaps and unanswered </p>
<p>questions in the declaration: “By demanding that Saddam produce the missing </p>
<p>pieces we would be putting the pressure back on him in a way which his </p>
<p>apologists would find difficult to counter”; and</p>

<p>that Saddam Hussein should be given an ultimatum to leave Iraq.</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Returning to the issue of a second resolution, Sir David wrote that he had repeated </p>
<p>that it would be needed:</p>
<p>“… if we were to take military action. This was not because our determination to deal </p>
<p>with the Iraqi problem had diminished in any way. Rather it was about the political </p>
<p>realities in the UK.”</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Sir David Manning recorded that the UK must now work closely with the Americans </p>
<p>over inspections and approaches to Dr Blix. He knew that the FCO and SIS were </p>
<p>working on that and he had asked for advice by 8 January, “on the best way forward”, </p>
<p>which he could show to Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice had also discussed the possibility of a meeting between </p>
<p>President Bush and Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Sir David recommended that Mr Blair should read the record of the conversation in </p>
<p>full and that it had been “helpful on a second resolution”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> Dr Rice had been very keen </p>
<p>that President Bush and Mr Blair should meet at the end of January.</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Describing this conversation, Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that Dr Rice </p>
<p>had told Sir David Manning that:</p>
<p>“… she had been giving considerable thought to this whole issue over the Christmas </p>
<p>holidays and had decided that a second resolution was necessary for American </p>
<p>interests, that the American public were not necessarily fully on board for an attack </p>
<p>on Iraq and the use of the American military and this was something that she felt the </p>
<p>President would need to consider very carefully.”</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>415.  After the conversation with President Bush on 16 December and the meeting </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>418. </b> In a meeting overseas in early January, SIS1 told Mr Blair that the body of </p>
<p>available evidence was “highly damning” but “none of the reports could yet be termed </p>
<p>a silver bullet”.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> Mr Blair had been “surprised and pleased” that so much had been </p>
<p>accumulated, but he needed some more evidence that Saddam Hussein was in breach </p>
<p>(of resolution 1441), which he (Mr Blair) could use as the basis for personal assurances </p>
<p>to Cabinet, the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), and to key allies such as President </p>
<p>Chirac and President Bush and regional leaders. As a result, SIS1 recorded that </p>
<p>Mr Blair had asked for a “stocktake”, including an assessment of the likelihood that the </p>
<p>UNMOVIC process would produce that kind of evidence.</p>
<p><b>419. </b> On 4 January, Mr Blair sent a long note to officials in No.10.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>420. </b> On Iraq, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“We start from behind. People suspect US motives; don’t accept Saddam is a threat; </p>
<p>worry it will make us a target. Yet the truth is removing Saddam is right; he is a </p>
<p>threat; and WMD has to be countered. So there is a big job of persuasion. We need </p>
<p>the following in place:</p>
<p>(i) </p>
<p>most obviously, the evidence of breach of the UN resolution leading </p>
<p>hopefully to a new resolution. Time is short. We need either evidence of </p>
<p>actual WMD; or documentation concealed; or an eye witness account </p>
<p>of the programme. We are making efforts on all three. But one or more </p>
<p>needs to be in place. [...] our biggest hindrance, is the intimidation </p>
<p>Saddam is exercising. Those who might co&#8209;operate are being told </p>
<p>very clearly their families will die. So even though we all know the </p>
<p>declaration … is a lie, proving the lie will be hard. I need an early meeting </p>
<p>on this with C.</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>We need to set out the WMD case generally; publish evidence of it; and </p>
<p>have some high profile interdiction of WMD material. People just totally </p>
<p>underestimate the WMD threat.</p>
<p>(iii) </p>
<p>We need to link WMD and terrorism. The truth is the two coming together, </p>
<p>is only a matter of time. But people need to understand that if we don’t </p>
<p>act, the world will be more unsafe.</p>
<p>(iv) </p>
<p>We need to prepare a very clear statement of guarantees for the Iraqi </p>
<p>people, setting out territorial integrity etc; and I assume without Saddam </p>
<p>we could lift sanctions.</p>
<p>(v) </p>
<p>We need to work out the post&#8209;Saddam scenario. Are we going to identify </p>
<p>him, and his close associates only, as fit for removal, in the hope of having </p>
<p>the regime crumble; or are we going to be more forward. By instinct, </p>
<p>I favour making it clear: removing Saddam is the immediate task; the </p>

<p>new government has to be stable; and we can move forward in time … </p>
<p>There must be as little as possible vested interest in resistance.</p>
<p>(vi) </p>
<p>We need to be sure the military plan is viable. I need a meeting on this </p>
<p>and our military’s assurance that the plan can work. This is no small </p>
<p>undertaking.</p>
<p>(vii)  We must strive to move the MEPP forward …</p>
<p>(viii) We have got to show sensitivity to any humanitarian fall&#8209;out from war. </p>
<p>Britain should take the lead on this, working with the UN.”</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Blair believed it would be “sensible to go to Washington late January in order to </p>
<p>finalise the strategy”.</p>
<p><b>422. </b> There is no evidence that Mr Blair had seen Mr Straw’s minute of 3 January or </p>
<p>Sir David Manning’s minute of the same day before he wrote his note of 4 January.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that, in December 2002 and during a short winter </p>
<p>break in January 2003, he had “tried to work out what was the right thing to do”. He was:</p>
<p>“… past expediency, past political calculation, past personal introspection. I knew </p>
<p>this could be the end politically. I just wanted to know: what is the right thing?</p>
<p>“I could see by now … that barring something unanticipated, the likelihood was war. </p>
<p>We could opt out … I was sure … and stay out of the conflict, coming in only for </p>
<p>the aftermath. We had many allies by then. Thirteen out of 25 EU countries were </p>
<p>onside … But many were taking the route of avoiding the initial fighting.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>424. </b> At Chequers over Christmas 2002, he had asked himself:</p>
<p>“What did I truly believe? That Saddam was about to attack Britain or the US? </p>
<p>No. That he was a bigger WMD threat than Iran or North Korea or Libya? Not really, </p>
<p>though he was the only leader to have used them. That left alone now, with these </p>
<p>inspections ending the same way as the last, he would threaten the stability of </p>
<p>the region? Very possibly. That he would leach WMD material or provide help to </p>
<p>terrorists? Yes … Was it better for his people to be rid of him? For sure. Could it be </p>
<p>done without a long and bloody war? You can never be sure of that. Did I want more </p>
<p>time? Yes, but to allow me to probe every other way of doing it, rather than because </p>
<p>I believed the nature of his regime would ever change. Would a new Iraq help build </p>
<p>a new Middle East? I thought that was possible.</p>
<p>“Did I think that if we drew back now, we would have to deal with him later? … yes, </p>
<p>there was no other way that this man with his past was going to be anything other </p>
<p>than a source of instability. At some point, especially if strengthened now, he would </p>
<p>be back to his old tricks.</p>

<p>“So, in or out? In I concluded. And, if in, better in fully and not partly. I still thought it </p>
<p>possible to avoid war. I still thought it possible that other alternatives, diplomatic or </p>
<p>through a coup, of some sort (there was much private Arab talk about such a thing), </p>
<p>could be available to avoid conflict. I was determined at the least, to try to persuade </p>

<p>PUBLICATION OF THE UK’S POLICY OBJECTIVES</p>
<p><b>425.  The UK’s policy objectives in relation to Iraq were published by Mr Straw </b></p>
<p><b>on 7 January.</b></p>
<p><b>426. </b> Mr Blair’s Note of 4 January was discussed at Mr Blair’s Monday morning meeting </p>
<p>with No.10 staff on 6 January.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>427. </b> Subsequent discussions and decisions on the military plan, and planning for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance and a post&#8209;conflict Iraq, are addressed in Section 6.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:</p>
<p>“TB was pretty sure there would be a war, or that in any event Saddam would go, </p>
<p>and war remained the likeliest if not the only way of that coming about.”</p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Campbell added:</p>
<p>“On Iraq, pretty much everyone was emphasising how little support there was, how </p>
<p>little understanding there was of a real threat, but he [Mr Blair] was in pretty defiant </p>
<p>mood on that too, said the threat was real and people would come round.”</p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that he had talked to Mr Blair and then agreed in a conference </p>
<p>call that the policy objectives should be published. In Mr Campbell’s view: “These </p>
<p>strategy papers were as much about internal understanding as publicity.”</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Bowen informed the FCO on 6 January that Mr Blair had decided to publish </p>
<p>the policy objectives for Iraq.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>432. </b> The objectives were published in a Written Ministerial Statement by Mr Straw </p>
<p>on 7 January.</p>
<p>153</p>

<p>relevant … Security Council resolutions … including by giving up its weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”. He “thought, however, that the House would now appreciate a more </p>
<p>detailed statement of the Government’s objectives”.</p>
<p><b>434. </b> The “prime objective” was:</p>
<p>“… to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated </p>
<p>programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles … as </p>
<p>set out in UNSCRs. This would reduce Iraq’s ability to threaten its neighbours </p>
<p>and the region, and prevent Iraq using WMD against its own people. UNSCRs </p>
<p>also require Iraq to renounce terrorism, and return captured Kuwaitis and property </p>
<p>taken from Kuwait.”</p>
<p><b>435. </b> Iraq’s failure to comply with the “will of the international community” as expressed </p>
<p>by the UN was “thereby perpetuating the threat to international peace and security”.</p>
<p><b>436. </b> Mr Straw also stated that a “further objective” was “to maintain the authority </p>
<p>of the United Nations by demonstrating the Security Council’s effective response </p>
<p>to the challenge posed by Iraq’s non&#8209;compliance”; and that “Success in achieving our </p>
<p>prime objective should help deter the proliferation of WMD and BM [ballistic missiles] </p>
<p>more generally.”</p>
<p><b>437. </b> Mr Straw identified that the six “immediate priorities” were to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support UNMOVIC/IAEA inspectors in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enable UNMOVIC/IAEA to ensure long&#8209;term Iraqi compliance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintain international solidarity behind the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preserve regional stability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to make military plans in case military action was needed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to support humanitarian efforts to relieve suffering in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>438. </b> The objectives were based closely on those approved by Mr Blair in October 2002, </p>
<p>as was the definition of the post&#8209;conflict end state:</p>
<p>“We would like Iraq to become a stable, united and law abiding state, within </p>
<p>its present borders, co&#8209;operating with the international community, no longer </p>
<p>posing a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its </p>
<p>international obligations and providing effective and representative government to its </p>
<p>own people.”</p>
<p><b>439. </b> A reference to achieving the end state “as rapidly as possible” was omitted. Other </p>
<p>changes included the addition of a statement that the objectives were “consistent with </p>
<p>wider government policy”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Efforts to resolve other causes of regional stability, including the MEPP”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Wider political engagement with Arab countries and the Islamic world”;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Efforts to counter the proliferation of WMD”; and</p>

<p>“The elimination of terrorism as a force in international affairs”.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Mr Straw also stated:</p>
<p>“To achieve our objectives we will act in conformity with international law, including </p>
<p>the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law.”</p>
<p><b>441. </b> Mr Straw concluded that the Government was “working intensively with our </p>
<p>allies and partners to secure the peaceful disarmament of Iraq’s WMD by means of </p>
<p>UNMOVIC/IAEA inspections”. He also warned that if the Iraqi regime did not comply, </p>
<p>it would, as resolution 1441 made clear, “face serious consequences”.</p>
<p>MR HOON’S STATEMENT, 7 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>442.  On 7 January, Mr Hoon announced a decision to deploy additional maritime </b></p>
<p><b>forces, including an amphibious capability, and an order to enable the call&#8209;out of </b></p>
<p><b>Reservists.</b></p>
<p><b>443.  This was presented as a necessary part of a policy of maintaining the </b></p>
<p><b>pressure on Saddam Hussein to persuade him to disarm. Mr Hoon stated that </b></p>
<p><b>no decision had been taken to commit UK forces to military action; and no </b></p>
<p><b>“justification” for military action had been identified.</b></p>
<p><b>444. </b> In an oral statement on Iraq on 7 January, Mr Hoon commended the policy </p>
<p>objectives to the House of Commons.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Mr Hoon also stated that the Government was “restating” its “full and active </p>
<p>support” for the UN inspections and was “looking to them to investigate urgently the </p>
<p>gaps in Iraq’s declaration” of its WMD programmes, which failed “to give a satisfactory </p>
<p>account of Iraq’s activities”.</p>
<p><b>446. </b> Mr Hoon added that, while the Government wanted Iraq “to disarm voluntarily”, </p>
<p>it was “evident” that this would not be achieved unless Saddam Hussein was presented </p>
<p>with “a clear and credible threat of force”.</p>
<p><b>447. </b> Mr Hoon concluded:</p>
<p>“None of that means that the use of force is inevitable … no decision has been taken </p>
<p>to commit those forces to action … But … as long as Saddam’s compliance with … </p>
<p>resolution 1441 is in doubt … the threat of force must remain and it must be a </p>
<p>real one.”</p>

<p>81</p>
<p><b>449. </b> Mr Hoon did not respond to an observation from Mr Bernard Jenkin (Conservative) </p>
<p>that “It now seems unlikely that the UN inspectors will find any weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction in Iraq. Saddam Hussein has had too much time to conceal them and </p>
<p>to destroy the evidence.”</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Asked by Mr James Paice (Conservative) about the “huge task to convince the </p>
<p>British people that they are doing the right thing”, Mr Hoon replied that it was:</p>
<p>“… not possible to secure overwhelming public support for military action before </p>
<p>the explanation for that military action has been given and, therefore, before the </p>
<p>justification for that military action has been identified. We have not yet reached that </p>
<p>point in the process, and unless and until we do I accept that we cannot explain the </p>
<p>justification for military action.”</p>
<p><b>451. </b> Other points made by Mr Hoon in response to questions included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi declaration was “seriously short on detail and lacks in particular any </p>
<p>significant reference” to the conclusions reached by UNSCOM in 1999.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein left Iraq, there “would be a different regime as far as the </p>
<p>international community was concerned”. The removal of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction from the control of the regime would be a “prerequisite”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military action would be necessary “because every other avenue has been </p>
<p>exhausted” and the opportunities offered by resolution 1441 had been “spurned </p>
<p>by the Government in Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no “inevitability about conflict”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The position of the US was “no different” to that of the UK, “it agreed to a United </p>
<p>Nations process and it wants that process to be properly implemented and </p>
<p>enforced”.</p>
<p>MR BLAIR’S SPEECH TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE CONFERENCE, 7 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>452.  As recommended by Mr Straw and Mr Campbell, Mr Blair used his speech </b></p>
<p><b>to senior diplomats and others on 7 January to set out the importance for the </b></p>
<p><b>UK of remaining “the closest” ally of the US.</b></p>
<p><b>453.  Within that context, Mr Blair stated that if Iraq defied the UN, the US should </b></p>
<p><b>not be “forced to take on this issue alone”.</b></p>
<p><b>454. </b> In his speech to the Foreign Office Conference on 7 January about Britain’s </p>
<p>place in the world, Mr Blair stated that “people all over the world” wanted the “universal </p>
<p>values” of freedom, human rights, the rule of law and democracy, alongside “justice, the </p>
<p>opportunity for all”.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> The world had an “overriding common interest to make progress </p>
<p>with order”; and that the threat was “change through disorder, because then the </p>
<p>consequences of change cannot be managed”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>455. </b> Mr Blair set out seven principles to guide the UK. The first was that the UK:</p>
<p>“… should remain the closest ally of the US, and as allies to influence them to </p>
<p>continue broadening their agenda. We are an ally of the US not because they are </p>
<p>powerful, but because we share their values … Anti&#8209;Americanism … is a foolish </p>
<p>indulgence. For all their faults and all nations have them, the US are a force for </p>
<p>good …</p>
<p>“… it is massively in our self&#8209;interest to remain close allies …</p>
<p>“But we should use this alliance to good effect … People listen to the US … they </p>
<p>want the US to listen back.</p>
<p>“So for the international community, the MEPP is … important … the UN </p>
<p>is important.</p>
<p>“The US choice to go through the UN over Iraq was a vital step, in itself and </p>
<p>as a symbol of the desire to work with others …</p>
<p>“The price of British influence is not … to do what the US asks. I would never commit </p>
<p>British troops to a war I thought was wrong or unnecessary. Where we disagree … </p>
<p>we disagree.</p>
<p>“But the price of influence is that we do not leave the US to face tricky issues </p>
<p>alone. By tricky, I mean the ones which people wish weren’t there, don’t want to </p>
<p>deal with, and … know the US should confront … So if the US act alone, they are </p>
<p>unilateralist … International terrorism is one such issue … WMD is another …  </p>
<p>[A]t my first meeting with President Bush I said this was the key issue facing the </p>
<p>international community. I believe this even more today … But no one can doubt the </p>
<p>salience of WMD … and the importance of countering it …</p>
<p>“So when as with Iraq, the international community through the UN makes a demand </p>
<p>on a regime to disarm itself of WMD and that regime refuses, that regime threatens </p>
<p>us. It may be uncomfortable … unless the world takes a stand on this issue of WMD </p>
<p>and sends out a clear signal, we will rue the consequences of our weakness.</p>
<p>“America should not be forced to take on this issue alone. We should be part of it. </p>
<p>Of course it should go through the UN – that was our wish and what the US did. </p>
<p>But if the will of the UN is breached then the will should be enforced.</p>
<p>“Jack Straw has today set out for Parliament … our policy objectives on Iraq.</p>
<p>“So when the US confront these issues, we should be with them, and we should, </p>
<p>in return, expect these issues to be confronted with the international community, </p>
<p>proportionately, sensibly and in a way that delivers a better prospect of long&#8209;term </p>
<p>peace, security and justice.”</p>

<p>world”. Mr Blair stated: “The reason there is opposition over our stance on Iraq has </p>
<p>less to do with any love of Saddam, but over a sense of double standards. The MEPP </p>
<p>remains essential …”</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 8 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>457.  In PMQs on 8 January Mr Blair reiterated his position that if Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>did not disarm voluntarily he would be disarmed by force, but he declined to </b></p>
<p><b>speculate about the circumstances when that would be necessary.</b></p>
<p><b>458. </b> Iraq and reports of differences between Mr Straw and Mr Hoon were raised by </p>
<p>several Members of Parliament during Prime Minister’s Questions on 8 January.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>459. </b> Mr Blair consistently reiterated his position that Iraq must comply with the Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions and “must be disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction”. If Iraq </p>
<p>did not do so willingly, it would “have to be done by force”.</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Blair declined to respond to questions from Mr Iain Duncan Smith about </p>
<p>whether he agreed with Mr Straw’s view that the prospects of military action were </p>
<p>“60:40 against”.</p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr Duncan Smith also commented that “one cannot half prepare for war. Not for </p>
<p>the first time, the Government are sending different messages to different audiences …”</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Referring to Mr Hoon’s statement the previous day, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“We have made every preparation that we should make … It is completely wrong </p>
<p>to say that British troops are half prepared for any action. That is nonsense.”</p>
<p><b>463. </b> In response to questions from Mr Charles Kennedy about whether Britain would </p>
<p>be involved if the inspectors failed to produce concrete evidence of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction but the US “nonetheless” decided to go ahead with military action, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that he was “not going to speculate on the circumstances that might arise”. </p>
<p>The weapons inspectors were “in Iraq to discover whether there has been a breach </p>
<p>of the UN resolution” and they should be “allowed to do their work”.</p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Blair also told:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mrs Anne Campbell (Labour) that she was “right to say that people have </p>
<p>anxieties about the possibility of conflict in Iraq” and that British troops “should </p>
<p>never” be put into action “unless it is necessary to do so”, but he “believed </p>
<p>passionately that the issue of weapons of mass destruction and the related issue </p>
<p>of international terrorism” were the “key security threats” facing the UK and that </p>
<p>it was “only a matter of time before those issues come together”; and</p>

<p>Mrs Patsy Calton (Liberal Democrat) that it was his “duty to explain” why he </p>
<p>thought it was “necessary in certain circumstances to commit British troops </p>
<p>to war”. If Saddam Hussein was “in breach of the United Nations’ will and </p>
<p>we refused to act as an international community” it would “send a signal to </p>
<p>Saddam that we would do nothing to prevent him from building up weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction” and “a signal that we were not serious about the issue of </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction”. He understood why people felt that it was “a very </p>
<p>distant threat”, but what was dangerous was to do nothing: we would “rue the </p>
<p>consequences of that weakness later”.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Mr Blair had an internal meeting on Iraq with No.10 officials after PMQs on </p>

<p> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had said that, if Dr Blix found nothing and </p>
<p>the UN gave no specific sanction, it was going to be very hard to do. Mr Blair felt that we </p>
<p>had to be out there fairly soon making the case, that it was only a matter of time before </p>
<p>Al Qaida get their hands on WMD unless we show how serious we are at dealing with </p>
<p>the WMD issue. He was clear that it was the right thing to do, but also accepted that </p>

<p><b>467. </b> Mr Straw was overseas on 9 January.</p>

<p>“The report to the UN Security Council on 27 January was in no sense a deadline, </p>
<p>rather a first report of [the inspectors’] findings. Meanwhile, the build up of military </p>
<p>forces was necessary to sustain the pressure on Iraq.”</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>469. </b> Points made during the discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the inspections process had its own integrity and should not be compromised;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inspections were being conducted against the background of a concerted </p>
<p>Iraqi plan to disperse and conceal WMD, including threats to execute Iraqi </p>
<p>experts involved with such programmes if they divulged information to the UN </p>
<p>inspectors;</p>

<p>the MEPP had to be taken forward and efforts were continuing to hold a </p>
<p>conference with the Palestinians on reform in London the following week.</p>
<p><b>470. </b> Mr Hoon reported his visit to Turkey and the sensitivities about actions </p>
<p>involving Iraq.</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Commenting on the preparations for the deployment of military forces to the </p>
<p>Gulf, Mr Hoon told his colleagues that no decisions had been taken to launch military </p>
<p>action. Nor had the US finalised its military planning. Some changes to forces assigned </p>
<p>to Operation FRESCO, to provide an emergency fire fighting capability during the </p>
<p>firefighters’ strike, would be necessary to keep options open.</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the future behaviour of Saddam Hussein in responding </p>
<p>to UN pressure was “unpredictable”. The UK was “right to continue with its military </p>
<p>preparations”. It should also maintain the focus on the fight with international terrorism </p>
<p>and preventive measures at home. Media reports of a rift within the Cabinet were </p>
<p>“nonsense”. Cabinet the following week would “provide the opportunity for an in&#8209;depth </p>
<p>discussion of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>473. </b> In the press briefing after Cabinet, the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman </p>
<p>said that Mr Blair had “underlined his view that the weapons inspectors in Iraq had </p>
<p>to be given the time and space to do their job properly”, and that “while 27 January </p>
<p>was an important staging point in the process, it should not be regarded in any way </p>
<p>as a deadline”.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>474. </b> The Spokesman also said dismissed press reports that Mr Blair had authorised </p>
<p>an attack on one Secretary of State by another.</p>
<p><b>475. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that there had been a discussion about </p>
<p>comments by Cabinet Ministers and the need to avoid giving personal opinions.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ms Short had accused Mr Hoon and the MOD of briefing against Mr Straw. She had also </p>
<p>asked for a discussion of the military options because she did not believe that UK forces </p>
<p>were needed.</p>
<p><b>476. </b> In his memoir, Mr Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons, June 2001 to </p>
<p>March 2003, wrote that three newspapers that morning had carried a story demanding </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s resignation, and a claim that Mr Blair had authorised attacks by Mr Hoon.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Cook did not believe the story. He wrote that in Cabinet Ms Short had deplored the </p>
<p>attacks and he had said that Mr Straw was “doing a great job in keeping the Iraq crisis </p>
<p>in the UN track”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that “the presentation to … Cabinet was still – nothing </p>
<p>was inevitable. We are pressing the UN option. No decisions on military action, whereas </p>
<p>you can see that, at another level, the decisions on military action were hardening up </p>
<p>quite considerably.”</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>Security Council, 9 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>478.  In response to the briefing to the Security Council by Dr Blix and </b></p>
<p><b>Dr ElBaradei on 9 January, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that members </b></p>
<p><b>of the Security Council wanted time for the inspectors to reach a view.</b></p>
<p><b>479. </b> As agreed on 19 December, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei gave an informal update of </p>
<p>their assessment of the Iraqi declaration and the progress of inspection activities to the </p>
<p>members of the Security Council on 9 January.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> Dr Blix understood that the meeting </p>
<p>was intended to allow members of the Council to comment on Iraq’s declaration.</p>
<p><b>480. </b> Dr Blix stated that, if UNMOVIC had found a “smoking gun” or if there had been </p>
<p>any impediment to their inspections, it would have been reported to the Council. Iraqi </p>
<p>officials had “sought to construe the prompt access given to inspection teams and the </p>
<p>fact that no weapons of mass destruction or other proscribed items have been found </p>
<p>as confirmation” that there were none in Iraq; but the matter was “not … that simple”. </p>
<p>Prompt access was “an indispensible element of transparency” as part of a process </p>
<p>of peaceful disarmament, but it was:</p>
<p>“… by no means sufficient to give confidence that nothing is hidden in a large </p>
<p>country with an earlier record of avoiding disclosures. Iraq is very familiar with the </p>
<p>fact that only declarations supported by evidence, will give confidence about the </p>
<p>elimination of weapons. In this respect we have not so far made progress.”</p>
<p><b>481. </b> Commenting on the “issues on which doubts exist as to whether all proscribed </p>
<p>items or activities had been eliminated”, identified by UNSCOM and the Amorim report </p>
<p>in 1999 (see Section 1.1), Dr Blix added that UNMOVIC was “not bound by every </p>
<p>conclusion in these reports”. But they did give Iraq a “clear idea of questions, which </p>
<p>need to be answered and of doubts, which must be dispelled by very active efforts”. </p>
<p>His “overall impression” remained that Iraq’s declaration was “rich in volume but poor </p>
<p>in new information” and “practically devoid of new evidence on such issues”.</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Dr Blix said that “to create confidence that it has no more weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction or proscribed activities relating to such weapons, Iraq must present </p>
<p>credible evidence”. That could be “of the most varied kind”, including “interviews by </p>
<p>knowledgeable persons who are not subjected to intimidation”. He had “not asserted … </p>
<p>that proscribed items or activities” existed; but if they did “Iraq should present them </p>

<p>UNMOVIC, <i>Briefing the Security Council, 9 January 2003: Inspections in Iraq and a further assessment </i></p>
<p><i>of Iraq’s weapons declaration.</i></p>

<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>in our presence”. There was “still time” for that. There was “no way the inspectors” could </p>
<p>“close a file by simply invoking the precept that Iraq cannot prove the negative”. In “such </p>
<p>cases”, the inspectors “must conclude, as they have done in the past, that the absence </p>
<p>of the particular item is not assured”.</p>
<p><b>483. </b> Dr Blix listed a series of inconsistencies between the declaration and earlier Iraqi </p>
<p>declarations which had been described as full, final and complete, in addition to the </p>
<p>issues he had highlighted on 19 December, including in relation to special munitions, </p>
<p>imports of missile engines and solid missile fuel and VX. He also stated that UNMOVIC </p>
<p>did not feel that Iraq had “made a serious effort” to provide lists of personnel engaged </p>
<p>in proscribed programmes.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that good progress had been made in re&#8209;establishing </p>
<p>knowledge of Iraq’s capabilities and that “no evidence of ongoing prohibited </p>
<p>nuclear&#8209;related activities” had been detected and the IAEA’s verification activities </p>
<p>were “an important deterrent to the resumption of such activities”.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>485. </b> Further work would be necessary before the IAEA could draw definitive </p>
<p>conclusions, including in relation to reports of Iraqi attempts to import uranium after </p>
<p>1991, the relocation and consumption of dual&#8209;use materials, and the attempted purchase </p>
<p>of prohibited aluminium tubes, which appeared to be “consistent with the reverse </p>
<p>engineering of rockets” and “not directly suitable” for the manufacture of centrifuges. </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei emphasised the importance of active co&#8209;operation from Iraq.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> A press statement issued by the President of the Security Council stated that </p>
<p>the members had “listened with the utmost attention and interest”; and that they had </p>
<p>“reiterated their full support for the work and action of Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei and </p>
<p>to the continuation of inspection activities”.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the discussion had been “relatively low </p>
<p>key”. Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had made “clear that the Iraqi declaration is inadequate </p>
<p>and that Iraq needs to co&#8209;operate more pro&#8209;actively”.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> There had been more than </p>
<p>250 inspections at more than 200 sites. Sir Jeremy had noted that Iraqi co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>in giving access was “satisfactory”, but “more passive than active”. Iraq had to be </p>
<p>pro&#8209;active to prove it had no WMD. He had “hoped the pace could accelerate”.</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that Ambassador John Negroponte, US Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN, had again described the Iraqi declaration as a material breach </p>
<p>and stated that a continued failure to co&#8209;operate actively would constitute a further one.</p>

<p><b>489. </b> In a subsequent conversation with representatives of EU Missions in New York, </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy had stated that it was “clear that Council members wanted a steady, </p>
<p>intensifying process which would give the inspectors time to provide either positive </p>
<p>or negative proofs”; and that “if the inspections proceeded normally, with increasing </p>
<p>intensity, there would be no need to rush to an early military judgement (although the </p>
<p>US response … was unpredictable)”. The timetable set out in resolution 1284 (1999) </p>
<p>was “still obligatory”; and that the UK believed Iraq was concealing evidence.</p>

<p><b>Growing pressure to find evidence of Saddam Hussein’s </b></p>

<p><b>490.  With indications of concerns in Washington about becoming trapped in the </b></p>

<p><b>on the need to find convincing evidence that Saddam Hussein was not complying </b></p>
<p><b>with the obligations set out in resolution 1441 and preceding resolutions </b></p>
<p><b>intensified.</b></p>
<p><b>491. </b> Mr Blair had a meeting with Sir Richard Dearlove on the afternoon of 9 January.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is no No.10 record of the meeting.</p>
<p><b>492. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Secretary recorded Sir Richard’s view that it had </p>
<p>been a good meeting at which Mr Blair had emphasised the importance of being able </p>
<p>to demonstrate that the Iraqis were in material breach of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>493. </b> In response to a question from Mr Blair about the likelihood of being able to find </p>
<p>a “silver bullet” that would demonstrate a material breach, Sir Richard was reported to </p>
<p>have said that “he felt the odds were 50/50”. That was “higher than the US estimates but </p>
<p>he simply could not guarantee a successful outcome”.</p>
<p><b>494. </b> Sir Richard had also reported that Mr Blair’s parting words were: “Richard, my fate </p>
<p>is in your hands.”</p>
<p><b>495. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>C told Mr Blair that Dr Blix “knew he was being ‘cat and moused’ but he was </p>
<p>not on a mission. He was sure that Saddam was lying but he had to establish </p>
<p>that for himself. C felt that we had a better chance of finding the breaches than </p>
<p>the US.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had said, “half in jest”, “My future is in your hands.”</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>for the US but not for us.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“C said the other risk was that we found the evidence of the breach before the </p>
<p>US was ready to go to war … if the inspectors had another month with genuine </p>
<p>access, the picture would be pretty clear. We were now pushing the line that </p>
<p>they needed time and space to do the job.”</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>496. </b> Asked about the comment that Mr Blair’s future was in his hands, Sir Richard </p>
<p>Dearlove told the Inquiry that he thought Mr Blair “was beginning to understand that he </p>
<p>was in a tough position vis&#8209;a&#8209;vis the inspection issue”.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>497. </b> In response to a further question, Sir Richard stated:</p>
<p>“No, I think when the Prime Minister says something like that – the one thing </p>
<p>if you are head of SIS is you have to be quite robust, and not be sort of put off </p>
<p>by such comments.</p>
<p>“I think the problem for the Prime Minister at that point in time is it’s much more </p>
<p>important to him domestically that UNMOVIC has a success than it is to the </p>
<p>US Administration.”</p>
<p><b>498. </b> A report of a discussion between Adm Boyce and General Richard Myers, </p>
<p>Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that the US could stay poised for military </p>
<p>operations for 3&#8209;4 months.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Sir David Manning wrote to Mr Powell that this was a “much better timeline as far </p>
<p>as inspections are concerned. Whether Bush will buy it is another matter.”</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>500. </b> When Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke on 11 January, they discussed </p>
<p>reporting in both the UK and US, including a <i>Washington Post </i>article criticising Secretary </p>
<p>Powell for trapping the US Government in the UN route and Mr Blair’s comments that </p>
<p>27 January was not a deadline which would be widely noted in Washington.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>was a need to synchronise the military planning and politics. It was improbable that </p>
<p>the inspectors’ reports to the Security Council on 27 January would provide sufficient </p>
<p>evidence for a second resolution, and the negotiation of such a resolution would take </p>
<p>weeks.</p>

<p>should pass a new resolution. If it does, how can anyone dispute the case for war? </p>
<p>If the UN doesn’t, despite a breach, then we are in the same positions as we were </p>
<p>at the time of Kosovo. But the integrity of the UN process has to be upheld.</p>
<p>“We have two immediate weaknesses in our case:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>people think we will go to war even if no breach is found. That is not correct.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>people don’t really believe WMD or Saddam are real threats.”</p>
<p><b>503. </b> Mr Ricketts was in Washington on 13 January.</p>

<p> He reported to Mr Straw’s </p>
<p>Private Secretary that his overriding impression was that:</p>
<p>“… there is still a good deal of uncertainty and confusion, but that all accept we are </p>
<p>entering a critical four weeks, in which the tensions between the political/UN track </p>
<p>and the military build&#8209;up will come to a head … the President is getting impatient </p>
<p>and wants a basis for moving against Iraq sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>“There are conflicting pressures in all directions … the press are full of the </p>
<p>drum&#8209;beat of military build&#8209;up. With the sense that war is close, people want to rally </p>
<p>round the President. On the other hand there is still a lot of uneasiness … White </p>
<p>House letters are running nine to one against the war.</p>
<p>“… there will be big pressure on President Bush to say something powerful in the </p>
<p>State of the Union message on 28 January. I was assured … this would not be a </p>
<p>declaration of war. But equally no&#8209;one thinks that he will want the present uncertainty </p>
<p>to drag on … there is no work in hand on how to sustain the present strategy over </p>
<p>a period of months.</p>
<p>“Blix will be the fulcrum in the coming weeks … All I talked to were determined not </p>
<p>to allow Saddam to put us back in the position where the onus was on the inspectors </p>
<p>to find something …”</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Mr Ricketts reported that the US was considering a presentation setting out </p>
<p>“the evidence of Saddam’s bad faith” soon after 27 January to “challenge the Security </p>

<p>were mixed.</p>

<p>to comply”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>507. </b> Discussing the difficulty of finding a smoking gun, Sir David told Dr Rice:</p>
<p>“… we should not give up on looking for hard evidence. The discovery of the rocket </p>

<p>178</p>
<p> might not be a breach of 1441, but it was important evidence that Saddam </p>
<p>was determined to thwart international controls. It told us much about his approach </p>
<p>and vindicated our claims that he was a liar.”</p>
<p><b>508. </b> Sir David reported that he had:</p>
<p>“… rehearsed again our need for a second resolution before moving to military </p>
<p>action. There would be support here for action against Iraq if sanctioned by the UN. </p>
<p>But it would be very hard, and probably impossible, for us without another resolution. </p>
<p>The domestic politics were too difficult.”</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Sir David asked Dr Rice if the US would be content to let the inspections run until </p>
<p>the end of February; he “understood the military pressures” but it “would be important </p>
<p>to UK and wider European opinion to see the strongest possible case”. The UK “would </p>
<p>want … time to build this”. Sir David added that “the stronger the case, the easier the </p>
<p>President would find it to secure international support and a second resolution”.</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Sir David concluded that “at present it seems unlikely that there will be enough </p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S PRESS CONFERENCE, 13 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>511.  In public, Mr Blair emphasised that the inspectors had only just started work </b></p>
<p><b>and there was no point in imposing an “arbitrary timescale”.</b></p>
<p><b>512. </b> Mr Blair’s press conference on 13 January was dominated by questions on Iraq.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>513. </b> In his opening remarks, Mr Blair stated that, while the threat seemed to some </p>
<p>people to be remote, he passionately believed Iraq must be disarmed of its weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction; the authority of the United Nations must be upheld; and rogue states </p>
<p>and terrorist organisations shown that “when we say we intend to deal with the issue </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction, we mean it”. The UN had “given Saddam [Hussein] </p>
<p>a chance”; he should take the peaceful route and disarm.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>514. </b> In response to questions, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inspections were the right process, but the inspectors had only just started their </p>
<p>work and reached their full complement the previous week. There was no point </p>
<p>in putting an “arbitrary timescale” on their task. Saddam Hussein had a duty to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate. In Mr Blair’s view, Iraq’s declaration of 8 December was false and it </p>
<p>was the inspectors’ job to find out the truth and report their findings.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If there was a breach, there would be a further discussion at the UN and the UK </p>
<p>expected the UN to honour its undertakings and for its authority to be upheld.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The trade in chemical, biological and nuclear weapons posed a direct threat to </p>
<p>Britain’s security. Without a stand, it was simply a matter of time before terrorism </p>
<p>and weapons of mass destruction came together. Iraq was important because it </p>
<p>was known that Saddam Hussein had the weapons and had used them before. </p>
<p>It had been “chosen” by the UN and the UN “had to be a way of resolving </p>
<p>this and sending a signal to the whole of the world that this trade will not be </p>
<p>tolerated, that people who have these weapons in breach of UN resolutions, will </p>
<p>be forced to disarm”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “discussion” on Iraq had “begun against the background of sanctions </p>
<p>eroding, of us being unable to be sure that we were really preventing Saddam </p>
<p>acquiring these weapons and of intelligence to the British Security Services … </p>
<p>I don’t think they would be advising me this if they weren’t doing this honestly </p>
<p>and properly. There is no doubt at all in our mind that Saddam has been trying to </p>
<p>rebuild that arsenal of chemical, biological and potentially nuclear capability …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Indicting Saddam Hussein was “kept under consideration” and “reasonable </p>
<p>arguments” had been made by Ms Ann Clwyd, Vice&#8209;Chair of the Parliamentary </p>
<p>Labour Party and Chair of INDICT (see Box later in this Section), and others. It </p>
<p>would be a decision for the Attorney General “but we have to weigh up a number </p>
<p>of different considerations as to whether it is worth such a prosecution. But I </p>
<p>don’t think that should divert us from the main issue … which is … whether it is </p>
<p>necessary to change the regime in Iraq in order to disarm them of weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no point in speculating” about what might happen if the US wanted </p>
<p>to take action before a smoking gun had been found; whatever happened, </p>
<p>Saddam would be disarmed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The way to avoid military action would be for Saddam “to agree to make an </p>
<p>honest declaration of what he has and have it destroyed”.</p>

<p>LORD GOLDSMITH’S DRAFT ADVICE, 14 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>515.  As agreed with Mr Powell on 19 December 2002, Lord Goldsmith handed his </b></p>
<p><b>draft advice on resolution 1441 to Mr Blair on 14 January.</b></p>

<p><b>be required to revive the authorisation to use force contained in resolution 678 </b></p>
<p><b>(1990) although that decision did not need be in the form of a further resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>517.  Lord Goldsmith also wrote that there would be no authorisation for military </b></p>
<p><b>action in the event of a veto by one of the P5.</b></p>
<p><b>518. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> and No.10’s response, including Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>statements that military action would not be ruled out if a further resolution in response </p>
<p>to an Iraqi breach was vetoed, are addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>Mr Annan’s comments, 14 January 2003</b></p>
<p>At a press conference on 14 January, Mr Annan stated:</p>
<p>“We are all aware … of Council resolution 1441 (2002) and the legislative climate </p>
<p>surrounding the passage of that resolution. We will have to assume … that the </p>
<p>members of the Council acted in good faith; that the issue is disarmament and </p>
<p>that they will do whatever it takes to disarm; and that if the disarmament were to </p>
<p>succeed and we were to agree that Iraq has been stripped of its weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, then that should be the end of the story. If, on the other hand, it were to </p>
<p>come out that Iraq continues to defy, and that disarmament has not happened … the </p>
<p>Council will have to face up to its responsibilities and take the necessary action. But, </p>
<p>of course, this is the understanding and the spirit of the resolution, which I hope we </p>
<p>will all respect.”</p>

<p>PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 15 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>519. </b> During PMQs on 15 January Mr Blair answered a number of questions on Iraq.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Mr Alan Beith (Liberal Democrat) asked what would happen if the inspectors </p>
<p>reported on 27 January that they needed more time to complete their work, and </p>
<p>whether a statement made by Mr Blair’s official spokesman that the inspectors would </p>
<p>be given the time and space they needed reflected President Bush’s view. Mr Blair </p>
<p>initially referred to remarks made in his press conference on 13 January, including </p>
<p>that he was not going to speculate on “arbitrary timetables”, and to remarks made by </p>
<p>Mr Annan on 14 January that, if Iraq continued to defy the UN and disarmament hadn’t </p>
<p>happened, the Security Council would have to “face up to its responsibilities and take </p>
<p>the necessary action”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Pressed by Mr Beith to answer the question in the light of the very serious </p>
<p>consequences of military action before the case for it had been made, Mr Blair replied </p>
<p>that before the adoption of resolution 1441, many people had insisted that the US would </p>
<p>“not bother with” the UN and “would not give the process a chance to work”. “That had </p>
<p>not been the case”. Mr Blair added that “the single most dangerous thing we could do </p>
<p>at the moment”, which would in his view “increase the likelihood of conflict, would be to </p>
<p>send out a signal of any weakness in our determination to see the mandate laid out by </p>
<p>the UN carried through”.</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Asked by Mr Iain Duncan Smith whether the Government’s position was that a </p>
<p>second resolution was preferable or, as Ms Short had said, essential, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… we want a UN resolution. I have set out continually, not least in the House on </p>
<p>18 December [2002], that in circumstances where there was a breach we went back </p>
<p>to the UN and the spirit of the UN resolution was broken because an unreasonable </p>
<p>veto was put down, we would not rule out action. That is the same position that </p>
<p>everybody has expressed, and I think it is the right position. However … it is not </p>
<p>merely preferable to have a second resolution. I believe that we will get one.”</p>
<p><b>523. </b> In response to further questions from Mr Duncan Smith about differences within </p>
<p>the Cabinet, Mr Blair emphasised that the UN route had been chosen “very deliberately” </p>
<p>because it was “important” that Saddam Hussein was “disarmed with the support of the </p>
<p>international community”. He hoped that the House would unite around the position that, </p>
<p>if the UN resolution was breached, “action must follow, because the UN mandate has to </p>
<p>be upheld”.</p>
<p><b>524. </b> The Government’s position was that a “second UN resolution” was “preferable”, </p>
<p>but it had:</p>
<p>“… also said that here are circumstances in which a UN resolution is not necessary, </p>
<p>because it is necessary to be able to say in circumstances where an unreasonable </p>
<p>veto is put down that we would still act.”</p>
<p><b>525. </b> Mr Mohammad Sarwar (Labour) asked whether any breach of resolution 1441 </p>
<p>should be a matter for the weapons inspectors and the Security Council, not President </p>
<p>Bush and the US Administration; and whether unilateral US action would be defying the </p>
<p>United Nations. Mr Blair replied that the UN inspectors “should be allowed to do their </p>
<p>job”, but they had only been able to return to Iraq because of the “firm stand” that had </p>
<p>been taken. It was “important” to “continue to send that signal of strength”. If Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein believed “for a single instance that the will of the international community </p>
<p>has abated … the consequences of either conflict or prolonged conflict” would be </p>
<p>“increased”.</p>
<p><b>526. </b> Asked by Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru) how it could possibly be right to risk the </p>
<p>lives of British service men and women “on a venture in Iraq that does not have the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>backing of international law, or the support of the majority of the British people”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“… let us wait and see what happens in the coming weeks in relation to the United </p>
<p>Nations … [I]t is right that we are prepared to take action if necessary … because </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction – the proliferation of … weapons and ballistic missile </p>
<p>technology … are a real threat to the security of the world and this country …. [W]e </p>
<p>have to deal with North Korea, but that is not a reason for failing to deal with Iraq.</p>
<p>“The truth is that this issue of weapons of mass destruction is a real threat to the </p>
<p>world. I believe … that it is only a matter of time before it is linked with international </p>
<p>terrorism. Does anyone believe that, if we do not take a stand … now in respect of </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, some terrorist group is not in future going to get hold </p>
<p>of that material and use it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“This is a difficult time. I understand the concerns that some people have, but </p>
<p>sometimes the job of a Prime Minister is to say the things that others do not want </p>
<p>them to say but we believe are necessary to say because the threat is real and if </p>
<p>we do not deal with it the consequences of weakness will haunt future generations.”</p>
<p><b>527. </b> Other points made by Mr Blair included that, if Saddam Hussein wanted to avoid </p>
<p>conflict, he could “comply with the UN resolution, co&#8209;operate with the inspectors, tell </p>
<p>us where this material is, and have it destroyed as it should be. Conflict would then </p>
<p>be avoided … The choice is now for Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>Concern that the US might act at the end of January</b></p>
<p><b>528.  Sir David Manning was assured by Dr Rice on 15 January that the US would </b></p>
<p><b>not take any further action with the Security Council until after the planned </b></p>
<p><b>meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush at the end of January.</b></p>
<p><b>529.  Sir David told Dr Rice that public opinion had to be convinced that the </b></p>
<p><b>inspections process was serious and had produced serious evidence. The </b></p>
<p><b>UK needed timelines for decisions no earlier than March or April.</b></p>
<p><b>530. </b> Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice on 15 January.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>531. </b> In the context of a visit to Washington by Dr Blix the previous day, Sir David and </p>
<p>Dr Rice discussed the relationship between the timelines for inspections set out in </p>
<p>resolutions 1284 (1999) and the requirements of resolution 1441. Sir David thought </p>
<p>that the issue could be “finessed”; and suggested that, when they met on 17 January, </p>
<p>Mr Blair might encourage Dr Blix to report to the Security Council “at regular intervals” </p>
<p>about Saddam Hussein’s compliance. Although that “was not stipulated in the </p>
<p>183 </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>resolution”, it would be “hard for anyone to object” if Dr Blix agreed. The provisions of </p>
<p>resolution 1284 could “run in parallel”. Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed whether </p>
<p>Dr Blix could be encouraged to call for Saddam Hussein’s full co&#8209;operation to resolve </p>
<p>the issues in his report to the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the “immediate tasks” for Dr Blix, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an audit of Iraq’s declaration;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an energetic programme of site inspections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a process of interviews without minders; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether he should destroy proscribed items.</p>
<p><b>533. </b> They also discussed Iraq’s deceptions and concerns about whether UNMOVIC </p>
<p>could ensure that information about future inspections did not reach Iraqi officials.</p>
<p><b>534. </b> Sir David commented that, “as far as the battle for public opinion was concerned”, </p>
<p>the UK:</p>
<p>“… needed hard evidence that Saddam had WMD if we could possibly get it, which </p>
<p>meant allowing time for us to acquire and deploy the intelligence. There was a </p>
<p>suspicion in the UK that we were rushing our fences. It would be very difficult to </p>
<p>persuade people … that [the Security Council on] 27 January should do more than </p>
<p>take note of Dr Blix’s report … [I]t was too soon to try to use it as the moment when </p>
<p>we could demonstrate that the inspection system had failed.”</p>
<p><b>535. </b> Sir David asked Dr Rice about developments in her thinking about how the </p>
<p>US Administration would handle the meeting and immediate follow&#8209;up. Dr Rice replied </p>
<p>that Secretary Powell would not present the US case on Iraq’s deception until after </p>
<p>the meeting between President Bush and Mr Blair on 31 January. President Bush </p>
<p>would “not want to give the impression that he was presenting the Prime Minister with </p>
<p>a <i>fait accompli</i>”.</p>
<p><b>536. </b> Sir David reported that he had welcomed that assurance, and pointed out that </p>
<p>Mr Blair had taken a very robust line at his press conference on 13 January; but “there </p>
<p>was nevertheless a great deal of uneasiness and opposition to Government policy … </p>
<p>We had to take account of this …”</p>
<p><b>537. </b> Sir David added that he had “repeated that this meant there was a premium on </p>
<p>producing hard evidence if we could, and allowing the inspection process more time. </p>
<p>This was also necessary if we were to get the support we needed for a second UNSCR.”</p>
<p><b>538. </b> Responding to Dr Rice’s view that President Bush would want to take advantage </p>
<p>of the current military window, Sir David had stated that he “realised this”, but “additional </p>
<p>days and weeks mattered in the battle for public opinion … the UK needed timeline[s] for </p>
<p>decisions that were no earlier than March or April, not January or February.”</p>

<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>539. </b> Sir David reported that, in the context of a discussion about France’s arguments for </p>
<p>more time and that war should be avoided to prevent a conflagration in the Middle East, </p>
<p>Dr Rice had said President Bush “was not prepared to wait for months and months”. </p>
<p>Sir David’s view was that:</p>
<p>“If military action proved necessary, it would be better to do it sooner rather than </p>
<p>later in terms of managing our relations with the Arab world … the argument for not </p>
<p>rushing our fences applied much more strongly to Western … countries. We had </p>
<p>to convince our public opinions that the inspection process was serious, that it had </p>
<p>produced serious evidence, and that this was the basis for a second resolution.”</p>
<p><b>540. </b> Sir David commented that he was “encouraged” by the response to his arguments </p>
<p>about “the political pressures and realities … and the need for time and evidence”.</p>
<p><b>541.  Mr Straw warned Sir David Manning on 16 January that the momentum </b></p>
<p><b>in Washington was to do something soon after 27 January, and it was being </b></p>
<p><b>assumed that Mr Blair would be with President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>542.  Mr Straw recommended that Mr Blair should speak to President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>543.  Sir David Manning agreed, reiterating his advice that more time was required.</b></p>
<p><b>544. </b> On 16 January, Mr Straw discussed the UK’s need for more time and “decisions </p>
<p>no earlier than March and April rather than January and February”, as Sir David Manning </p>
<p>had told Dr Rice the previous day, with Secretary Powell.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>545. </b> Reporting the conversation to Sir David, Mr Straw warned that the momentum in </p>
<p>Washington to do something soon after 27 January was “running very high”. It might </p>
<p>be “virtually impossible” for the US to follow the timetable of “no deadlines” set out in </p>
<p>resolution 1284.</p>
<p><b>546. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that there had been “unanimous support” for </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s position “after a good discussion in Cabinet”.</p>
<p><b>547. </b> Mr Straw also advised that assumptions were being made that Mr Blair would be </p>
<p>with President Bush “in any event”. The US could not create a Coalition without the UK; </p>
<p>and it would be hard to imagine the US taking military action without the UK.</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Mr Straw recommended that Mr Blair should talk to President Bush in the middle </p>
<p>of the following week “before the draft State of the Union speech is put to bed”.</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Sir David Manning told Mr Blair that he agreed with Mr Straw’s recommendation, </p>
<p>commenting that it would be easier for the UK if there were “major inspection </p>
<p>successes”.</p>

<p><b>resolution. While sticking to the UN route, the UK should not rule out the </b></p>
<p><b>possibility of military action without a second resolution. Mr Blair repeated the </b></p>
<p><b>latter statement in his concluding remarks.</b></p>
<p><b>553. </b> At Cabinet on 16 January, Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… he wanted to make the United Nations route work. The inspectors were doing </p>
<p>their job inside Iraq and he was optimistic that they would discover weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction and their associated programmes which had been concealed. </p>
<p>They needed time to achieve results, including from better co&#8209;ordinated intelligence. </p>
<p>If Iraq was not complying with the demands of the United Nations, he believed the … </p>
<p>Security Council would pass a second resolution.”</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>554. </b> Mr Blair told his colleagues that evidence from the inspectors would make a veto of </p>
<p>a second resolution, by other Permanent Members of the Security Council, “less likely”:</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, British and American forces were being built up in the Gulf. If it came </p>
<p>to conflict, it would be important for success to be achieved quickly. The [military] </p>
<p>build up was having an effect on the Iraqi regime, with internal support dwindling for </p>
<p>President Saddam Hussein …”</p>
<p><b>555. </b> Mr Blair concluded by telling Cabinet that:</p>
<p>“The strategy remained to pursue the United Nations course. He would be meeting </p>
<p>President Bush to discuss Iraq at the end of the month, after Dr Blix had reported </p>
<p>to the Security Council on 27 January.”</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Mr Straw said that:</p>
<p>“… he was aware of anxieties about the possibility of having to diverge from the </p>
<p>United Nations path. There was a good prospect of achieving a second resolution. </p>
<p>Many had been doubtful about achieving the first resolution; in the event, the … </p>
<p>Security Council vote had been unanimous. While sticking with the United Nations </p>

<p>route we should not rule out the possibility of military action without a second </p>
<p>resolution. Voting decisions in the Security Council could be driven by domestic </p>
<p>politics, not the demands of the international situation.”</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Mr Straw added that:</p>
<p>“In his recent contacts with the Muslim and Arab world, all could see the benefit of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s demise. He had utterly rejected the notion that we were hostile </p>
<p>to Islam … Saddam Hussein had attacked his own people and his neighbours – all </p>
<p>of whom were Muslims.”</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Ms Short told the Cabinet that “keeping to the United Nations route would hold the </p>
<p>Government’s support together. She had been reviewing humanitarian scenarios for Iraq </p>
<p>and concluded that extra resources would be required, given the other humanitarian </p>
<p>priority of Southern Africa.”</p>
<p><b>559. </b> Ms Short added that the possibility “of chemical and biological weapons being used </p>
<p>inside Iraq, and their effect on local civilians”, was a “particularly worrying scenario”. </p>
<p>The involvement of the United Nations would be “essential” for the management of the </p>
<p>aftermath of military action: it would “provide legitimacy for the political and economic </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq, including the use of oil revenues. Work on the aftermath should </p>
<p>be taken forward urgently.”</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Points made during the discussion were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Communication “needed to be improved, on the basis of a core script”. </p>
<p>The message was “complex but should start from first principles; part of the </p>
<p>message was that the policy flowed from our own national interest and respect </p>
<p>for international law”. A “small proportion of the population would always be </p>
<p>opposed to military action, the political battle was for the centre ground which </p>
<p>could be won by argument”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon were “best able to speak from an </p>
<p>informed position, since they had access to the intelligence, Cabinet members </p>
<p>more generally needed to speak up for the Government’s policy on Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “leadership of the United States was not widely trusted” in the UK “but </p>
<p>President Bush’s resolve was weakening the Iraqi regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[T]he inspectors had only recently started their work and it was unreasonable </p>
<p>for opponents to assert that the absence of evidence so far meant that military </p>
<p>action was unjustified; once evidence of weapons of mass destruction was </p>
<p>produced, the public mood would change dramatically”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maintaining internal cohesion within the UK “was important, not least in respect </p>
<p>of the Islamic community”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[P]ushing the Middle East Peace Process forward remained an important part </p>
<p>of our policy, as was stability in the region”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><b>561. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“… the strategy based on the United Nations route was clear, although the </p>
<p>uncertainties loomed large and there was a natural reluctance to go to war. It was </p>
<p>to be expected that the public would want the inspectors to find the evidence before </p>
<p>military action was taken. Pursuing the United Nations route was the right policy, but </p>
<p>we should not rule out the possibility of military action without a second resolution. </p>
<p>The priorities for the immediate future were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improved communications, which would set out the Government’s strategy and </p>
<p>be promoted by the whole Cabinet;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparatory work on planning the aftermath of any military action and the role of </p>
<p>the United Nations in that, which should in turn be conveyed to the Iraqi people </p>
<p>so that they had a vision of a better life in prospect; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contingency work on the unintended consequences which could arise from </p>
<p>the Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction, environmental catastrophe or </p>
<p>internecine strife within Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>562. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Cabinet was “fine”. In addition to the points recorded </p>
<p>in the minutes, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had said that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia was “closer to the Americans” than it said publicly and France did </p>
<p>“not particularly want to be left on the outside”: “But it was going to be tough.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the meantime we build up our troops, and make sure that if it does come </p>
<p>to conflict we are able to get it over quickly.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we had to stay close [to the US] publicly to maximise influence privately.”</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>563. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Cook had said that “we were in a tremendous position in the UN”, thanks to </p>
<p>Mr Blair. The prospect of getting a second resolution was stronger if we did not </p>
<p>rule out doing without one.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of the Labour </p>
<p>Party, had “done a very passionate wind&#8209;up”; the “discussion showed that there </p>
<p>was no real division ‘so let’s stop pretending there is”. The briefings had to stop. </p>
<p>The [Labour] Party didn’t “like the idea of intervention but sometimes we have </p>
<p>to make difficult judgements”.</p>
<p><b>564.  The discussion at Cabinet on 16 January took place at a key point in the </b></p>
<p><b>development of the UK’s position on Iraq and focused primarily on the role of </b></p>
<p><b>inspections, forthcoming diplomatic activity at the UN, the need for effective </b></p>
<p><b>communication of the Government’s position, and a high level discussion of </b></p>

<p><b>There is no evidence of any discussion of the nature and scale of the likely UK </b></p>

<p><b>569.  The need for such a discussion is addressed in Section 7.</b></p>
<p><b>570. </b> Although Mr Blair had said on 24 October 2002 that Cabinet would, “in due time” </p>
<p>be able to discuss the military options, and he had said on 9 January that the discussion </p>
<p>on 16 January would be an “in&#8209;depth discussion” of Iraq, Cabinet was not told that the </p>

<p>is a sensible and significant one, and I recommend that with certain qualifications, </p>

<p>102</p>
<p><b>574. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 17 January, flagging up three major issues: targeting; </p>
<p>the response to any Iraqi use of WMD; and the need for greater clarity on thinking and </p>
<p>plans for the aftermath.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>575. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair: “Good questions. But I don’t think they </p>
<p>affect your decision in principle.”</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Mr Blair replied: “agreed”.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Late on 17 January, following a telephone conversation, Sir David replied </p>
<p>to Mr Watkins that Mr Blair was “content to proceed on the basis of the Defence </p>
<p>Secretary’s recommendations” and that he would be grateful “if you and the FCO would </p>
<p>now take things forward as proposed”.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>578. </b> Mr Hoon announced the deployment of UK ground forces, which would “include </p>
<p>the headquarters of 1 (UK) Armoured Division with support from 7 Armoured Brigade, </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade and 102 Logistics Brigade”, in an oral statement in Parliament </p>
<p>on 20 January.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>579. </b> Asked whether Cabinet on 16 January might have been an opportunity for some </p>
<p>of the points from the MOD briefing on military options to be mentioned, Lord Turnbull </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that Mr Blair was:</p>
<p>“… very reluctant to discuss the military options …</p>
<p>“I could see he didn’t want key discussions of where we were going, through the </p>
<p>North or the South and who was going to bring what forces to bear where, and </p>
<p>there is some sense in that. But the strategic choices that they implied … didn’t get </p>
<p>discussed either. For example, the fact that if you have ground forces you become </p>
<p>an Occupying Power. I don’t remember someone saying ‘Wouldn’t it be better if we </p>
<p>just halted at Option 2, because then we will not be involved in being an Occupying </p>
<p>Power?’ ...”</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>580. </b> Lord Turnbull subsequently added that Cabinet was given “Week by week progress </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with Dr Blix, 17 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>582.  In a meeting on 17 January, Mr Blair urged Dr Blix to tell Baghdad that this </b></p>
<p><b>was their last chance and the US was serious about military action. If Iraq was </b></p>
<p><b>co&#8209;operating, the inspectors would need more time; if it was not, it would be better </b></p>
<p><b>to make that clear soon.</b></p>
<p><b>583. </b> Reporting on the discussion in the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 15 January, Mr Paul </p>
<p>Johnston, Head of the FCO Security Policy (Sec Pol) Department, informed Mr Straw </p>
<p>that it was UK information which had led to the discovery of SA&#8209;2 (Volga) engines, </p>
<p>but “It was not yet clear whether they constituted a material breach.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> The MOD was </p>
<p>considering providing additional interviewers to support UNMOVIC, “whose resources </p>
<p>were stretched. Evidence from Iraqi scientists might be the most likely basis for an </p>
<p>eventual material breach.”</p>
<p><b>584. </b> Mr Johnston also reported that the FCO was addressing “how far and how fast </p>
<p>the US might push to bring matters to a head in the Security Council if, after 27 January, </p>
<p>the Americans became concerned that ‘business as usual’ had set in”. Mr Blair’s visit </p>
<p>to the US at the end of January might be too late to influence the immediate US reaction </p>
<p>to the Council discussion. Mr Blair might try to call President Bush the following week.</p>
<p><b>585. </b> In preparation for Mr Blair’s meeting with Dr Blix on 17 January, the FCO advised </p>
<p>No.10 that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix had made a “sound start in getting UNMOVIC operational”; the UK had </p>
<p>provided “considerable support, which we believe is beginning to show fruit”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK intelligence had helped UNMOVIC to discover illegally imported rocket engines.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The key message was the need for UNMOVIC to intensify its inspections, not </p>
<p>to focus exclusively on infrastructure, which was “often easy to conceal or move </p>
<p>around”, and to focus on interviews, both formal and informal, of Iraqi scientists.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had doubts about the practicality of interviews outside Iraq but was </p>
<p>looking at ways to try to overcome those.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Expectations were “running high” for the 27 January meeting. The UK was </p>
<p>making clear that it was “not a deadline but a status report”. After that, while </p>
<p>the “strategy outlined in 1284” would give UNMOVIC “60 days to identify key </p>
<p>disarmament tasks”, the UK wanted to use the next phase to “put maximum </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq to co&#8209;operate in answering all unresolved questions, </p>
<p>eg, including use of mobile laboratories”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK thought Dr Blix should offer to brief the UN Security Council  </p>
<p>more regularly, perhaps once a fortnight. That would include reporting illegal </p>
<p>imports for consideration of further action “even if there is no proven link to </p>
<p>illegal programmes”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>586. </b> In response to a request from Sir David Manning for advice on interviews by </p>
<p>UN inspectors in Iraq, Mr Scarlett provided a brief co&#8209;ordinated with the FCO, SIS, DIS </p>
<p>and OD Sec.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>587. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that Iraq had deployed many subterfuges to interfere with the </p>
<p>interview process conducted by UNSCOM in the 1990s. Despite those efforts, UNSCOM </p>
<p>had “found interviews an extremely important tool, particularly on the biological warfare </p>
<p>programme, where the availability of other types of information was limited”.</p>
<p><b>588. </b> Mr Scarlett described measures currently being taken by Iraq to ensure that </p>
<p>interviews did not “succeed in uncovering prohibited activity”. The UK had provided a </p>
<p>database with about 6,000 names although information on individuals involved in WMD </p>
<p>activities post 1991 was limited. The UK was in the process of providing a shortlist </p>
<p>of “priority” candidates for interview, and had offered advice on interview techniques. </p>
<p>So far, only the IAEA had conducted two formal interviews; both had taken place in Iraq </p>
<p>and the individuals had asked for Iraqi officials to be present.</p>
<p><b>589. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded that interviews had the “potential, if conducted effectively, </p>
<p>to uncover gaps in Iraq’s cover story”. Iraq was “worried about this prospect”. The UK </p>
<p>was concerned that UNMOVIC and the IAEA lacked “the expertise necessary to use </p>
<p>this important tool effectively”. Mr Blair should press Dr Blix on the continuing need </p>
<p>for effective interviews.</p>
<p><b>590. </b> In their meeting on 17 January, Mr Blair urged Dr Blix to “give Baghdad a strong </p>
<p>message that this was their final chance and that the US were serious about military </p>
<p>action”.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> Mr Blair also underlined “the importance of the inspectors carrying out </p>
<p>interviews without minders” and offered UK help in identifying potential interviewees.</p>
<p><b>591. </b> Following further discussion of recent developments including the finds of shells </p>
<p>and documents the previous day, Mr Blair stated that “if Iraq was co&#8209;operating then the </p>
<p>inspectors would need time to continue their work. But if Iraq was not co&#8209;operating it </p>
<p>would be better to make that clear soon after 27 January, before the end of February.”</p>
<p><b>592. </b> Dr Blix said:</p>
<p>“[A]lthough the Iraqis gave prompt access, they did not seem sincere. They </p>
<p>did things for the media, eg a 12,000 page declaration that contained no new </p>
<p>substance … The Prime Minister concluded that if there were a major find Blix would </p>
<p>report it immediately, and if there were not a major find before 27 January Blix would </p>
<p>report then that his overall assessment was a lack of substantive co&#8209;operation. </p>
<p>Blix agreed. He thought the Iraqis would prefer to deny access to the inspectors than </p>
<p>to be caught red&#8209;handed; he would of course report either to the Security Council.”</p>

<p><b>594. </b> In a joint statement issued on 20 January, following a meeting in Baghdad to take </p>

<p><b>595. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that, at the No.10 morning meeting on 20 January, Mr Blair was </p>

<p>201</p>
<p><b>596. </b> France as President of the Security Council had proposed a special, </p>

<p><b>597. </b> In his speech to the Security Council, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“… we have to expose the connection between the terrorists who respect no rules, </p>
<p>and the states which respect no rules. It is the leaders of rogue states who set the </p>
<p>example: brutalise their people; celebrate violence; provide a haven for terrorists </p>
<p>to operate; and, worse than that, through their chemical and biological weapons … </p>
<p>provide a tempting arsenal for terrorists to use …</p>
<p>“So … action to stop rogue states’ proliferation is as urgent as action to stop </p>
<p>terrorism … wherever we can, we should use diplomatic means to get proliferators </p>
<p>to comply as we are with North Korea … But there comes a moment when our </p>
<p>patience must run out.</p>
<p>“We are near that point with Iraq … so the moment of choice for Iraq is close. </p>
<p>He [Saddam Hussein] must either resolve this crisis peacefully, by the full and </p>
<p>active compliance with his Security Council obligations and full co&#8209;operation with </p>
<p>inspectors, or face the ‘serious consequences’ – the use of force – which this </p>
<p>Council warned would follow when it passed [resolution] 1441.”</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>598. </b> Mr McDonald reported that Mr Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, had </p>
<p>told Mr Straw in the margins of the discussion that Germany would not vote for a second </p>
<p>resolution, even if there was clear evidence of a material breach; and that there were </p>
<p>no circumstances in which Germany would be involved in military action.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> Asked if he </p>
<p>really meant no circumstances, such as “some flagrant breach, a large find, the murder </p>
<p>of an inspector”, Mr Fischer replied that that “was different”, and Germany “might” vote </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>599.  In remarks to the press, Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign </b></p>
<p><b>Minister, condemned unilateral use of military force and stated that, as long as </b></p>
<p><b>progress was being made through inspections, France saw no reason to choose </b></p>
<p><b>military intervention.</b></p>
<p><b>600. </b> In his press conference after the meeting, Mr de Villepin stated that Iraq could not </p>
<p>be separated from other proliferation issues, and what was done on Iraq:</p>
<p>“… must apply to all the other crises. If war is the only way to resolve the problem, </p>
<p>we’re immediately forced down a blind alley. The international community must </p>
<p>clearly demonstrate initiative and imagination. We must also maintain international </p>
<p>unity. Unilateral military intervention must be perceived as a victory for the maxim </p>
<p>‘might is right’, an attack against the primacy of the law and international morality.”</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr de Villepin stated that the international community had chosen inspections, </p>
<p>and Iraq had to understand that it was “high time that she co&#8209;operated actively”. Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction programmes had “essentially been halted, even frozen”. </p>
<p>In his view, Iraq could be disarmed by peaceful means.</p>
<p><b>602. </b> In response to questions, Mr de Villepin stated that there was a choice between </p>
<p>continuing with co&#8209;operation and “military intervention because we are impatient”. </p>
<p>France believed that “nothing today justifies envisaging military action”. The inspectors </p>
<p>had been working for “fewer than 60 days” and progress was “satisfactory”, although </p>
<p>there was more that could be done to seek Iraq’s active co&#8209;operation.</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr de Villepin raised questions about the legitimacy and effectiveness of any US </p>
<p>unilateral military action, and warned of the potential consequences for a united Iraq </p>
<p>and a stable and safe region in the Middle East. France’s view was that it would “take </p>
<p>us down a path where we would have no control over the gains and benefits”.</p>
<p><b>604. </b> Asked if France would use her veto, Mr de Villepin responded that President </p>
<p>Chirac had “said from the outset” that France would not “join in military action” that did </p>
<p>not have:</p>
<p>“… the support of the international community, UN support. Moreover we  </p>
<p>believe military intervention would be the worst solution, and that the use of force </p>
<p>can only be a last resort, implying that all other avenues have been exhausted. If </p>
<p>that point is reached, France, as a Permanent Member of the Security Council, will </p>
<p>shoulder her responsibilities, remaining true to her principles … so long as progress </p>
<p>can be made through co&#8209;operation with inspectors, there is no reason to choose … </p>
<p>military intervention …”</p>
<p><b>605. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that Mr de Villepin’s comments about the unilateral </p>
<p>use of force “had effectively denounced the US”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> That had “soured relations especially </p>
<p>with Colin [Powell]”.</p>

<p><b>606. </b> Mr Straw also wrote that the special Ministerial meeting of the Security Council, </p>
<p>and the three that followed in a seven&#8209;week period, were “among the most serious and </p>
<p>dramatic meetings in which I have ever been involved”.</p>
<p><b>The positions of other members of the Security Council</b></p>
<p><b>607.  President Bush stated on 21 January that it was clear Saddam Hussein was </b></p>
<p><b>not disarming and time was running out.</b></p>
<p><b>608.  Sir David Manning was assured by Dr Rice that the US wanted a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>609. </b> In a press conference following a meeting with leading economists at the White </p>
<p>House on 21 January, President Bush was asked if he was frustrated by the French </p>
<p>“saying that they would block a UN resolution authorizing force on Iraq”. He replied </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein possessed “some of the world’s deadliest weapons” and posed </p>
<p>“a serious threat to America and our friends and allies”. The world, including France, had </p>
<p>come together “to say he must disarm”. But he was “not disarming”, he was “delaying … </p>
<p>deceiving … asking for time”. He was “playing hide&#8209;and&#8209;seek with the inspectors”. </p>
<p>The US “in the name of peace” would “continue to insist” that he did disarm.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>610. </b> Asked when he intended to take a decision about whether the inspection process </p>
<p>had any real hope of disarming Saddam, President Bush replied:</p>
<p>“It’s clear to me now that he is not disarming … Surely we have learned how this </p>
<p>man deceives and delays. He’s giving people the run&#8209;around … time is running </p>
<p>out … Make no mistake … he will be disarmed.”</p>
<p><b>611. </b> President Bush concluded that Saddam Hussein had:</p>
<p>“… been given ample time to disarm. We have had ample time now to see that … </p>
<p>he’s employing the tricks of the past …</p>
<p>“He wants to focus the attention of the world on inspectors. This is not about </p>
<p>inspectors; this is about a disarmed Iraq …</p>
<p>“… this looks like a rerun of a bad movie and I’m not interested in watching it.”</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that President Bush’s remarks were a “clear </p>
<p>message that [the US was] losing patience with the UN, and they had pretty much </p>
<p>decided it was going to happen and that was that”. Mr Blair “felt there had definitely been </p>
<p>a change in mood and it was pretty bad”; President Bush needed to do more to make it </p>
<p>an international coalition.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Secretary Powell wrote in 2012:</p>
<p>“In January 2003, as war with Iraq was approaching, we needed to present our case </p>
<p>against Iraq to the public and the international community. By then the President </p>
<p>did not think that war could be avoided. He had crossed the line in his own mind, </p>
<p>even though the NSC [National Security Council] had never met – and never would </p>
<p>meet – to discuss the decision.”</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>614. </b> Following the debate at the UN on 20 January, Sir David Manning spoke again </p>
<p>to Dr Rice.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> He reported that opinion polls in the UK showed that “over 60 percent” of </p>
<p>those questioned would “accept” military action if mandated by a second UN resolution, </p>
<p>but the figures “plummeted to near single figures without one”. He reported that he had </p>
<p>been assured that the US Administration wanted a second resolution.</p>
<p><b>615.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the “vast majority” of the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council believed that the inspectors should be given more time, although many </b></p>
<p><b>were also sceptical of Iraqi co&#8209;operation.</b></p>
<p><b>616. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock chaired an informal discussion of Security Council </p>
<p>members on 21 January, which he described as to report on the discussion between </p>
<p>Dr Blix and Mr Blair on 17 January. Sir Jeremy had stated that the UK continued to feed </p>
<p>the inspectors with information on a “one way basis” and there was a “good chance” </p>
<p>that, as the inspectors got closer to Iraq’s proscribed activities, more information would </p>
<p>come out of the system:</p>
<p>“Iraq was therefore taking an amazing risk by trying to conceal its WMD. The </p>
<p>Iraqis had to realise that there was only one way to avoid complete disarmament </p>
<p>through military action – much more pro&#8209;active co&#8209;operation. If they did not provide </p>
<p>that co&#8209;operation they would themselves be choosing to realise the threat of </p>
<p>military action.”</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Negroponte had stated that the situation </p>
<p>could not be allowed to drag on; and that he was talking about days, not weeks or </p>
<p>months. It was for Iraq to prove to the Council it was complying, not the other way </p>
<p>round. The French Deputy Permanent Representative had argued that simply saying </p>
<p>that co&#8209;operation was insufficient was not enough; demonstrable, precise evidence </p>
<p>was needed to justify war, not become a prisoner of the military build&#8209;up. That could </p>
<p>be hours, but it could also be months or years.</p>
<p><b>618. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that the “vast majority” of Security Council members believed </p>
<p>that “inspections should be given more time, although many are also sceptical of </p>
<p>Iraqi co&#8209;operation”.</p>

<p>109</p>
<p><b>619. </b> In a separate telegram, Sir Jeremy Greenstock warned that “the terms of the </p>
<p>Iraq debate are not moving in our favour … most Council members are focused on </p>
<p>giving more time to inspections not on the Iraqi failure to disarm”.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> He highlighted </p>
<p>key areas for discussion at the Security Council meetings on 27 and 29 January, and </p>
<p>wrote: “If UNMOVIC can produce the evidence of Iraqi biological or chemical weapons </p>
<p>in particular … we have a very good chance of turning Council opinion back towards </p>
<p>a second resolution.”</p>
<p><b>620.  Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to France, advised that the gap </b></p>
<p><b>between the UK and French positions was “unbridgeable”. President Chirac was </b></p>
<p><b>strongly opposed to war and thought it would have disastrous consequences.</b> </p>
<p><b>France also questioned the level of threat posed by Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>621. </b> On 21 January, Sir John Holmes wrote to Sir David Manning setting out his </p>
<p>perspective on the French position.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> Sir John Holmes acknowledged that France would </p>
<p>try “to avoid having to veto” and noted that “opportunities to push Chirac in our direction </p>
<p>may arise as circumstances change”.</p>
<p><b>622. </b> Sir John reported that President Chirac strongly opposed war and that for him </p>
<p>preventing it was more important than disarming Saddam Hussein. It would be very </p>
<p>difficult to persuade President Chirac to:</p>
<p>“… support a second resolution and participate in war short of a new and evident </p>
<p><i>casus belli. </i>He may well accept the pain of exclusion from the action than change </p>
<p>this position, though he has yet to face up to this choice and hopes to avoid it. </p>
<p>The driving force of Chirac’s policy is to avoid a war at almost any cost. He does </p>
<p>not believe it is necessary/proportionate to the real threat. He fears disastrous </p>
<p>consequences in the region for the MEPP, for the US&#8209;Western image more widely, </p>
<p>and for further fuelling of terrorism …”</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Sir John reported that terrorism was perceived as the most urgent threat which the </p>
<p>French thought was in danger of being neglected. President Chirac was also “seriously </p>
<p>concerned” about the effect on the world economy and the impact of that on France’s </p>
<p>economic recovery. Beyond those concerns, Sir John described President Chirac as </p>
<p>wanting to demonstrate a different, multilateralist world view and preserve French </p>
<p>influence through keeping the main decisions in the Security Council. President Chirac </p>
<p>did not really believe Saddam Hussein was a threat although WMD more widely were.</p>
<p><b>624. </b> Sir John Holmes described French tactics as to “encourage international pressure </p>
<p>against the war, to argue for more time, to help the inspectors do their work, and </p>
<p>to put more pressure on Saddam to co&#8209;operate”. Sir John advised that President </p>
<p>Chirac did not believe there was anything seriously incriminating to find; a view which </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Sir John reported was “widely shared here”. Secondly, President Chirac thought Iraq’s </p>
<p>concealment techniques would be “too good for the inspectors”. Thirdly, if inspectors did </p>
<p>find something, the French were bound to argue, at least in the first place, that it showed </p>
<p>the inspections were doing their job, making war unnecessary.</p>
<p><b>625. </b> Sir John predicted that:</p>
<p>“If Saddam manifestly blocks the inspectors, with or without a major find, but more </p>
<p>obviously with, the French will probably concede that he has had his chance and </p>
<p>blown it, vote for a second resolution … and take part [in military action].</p>
<p>“If the inspectors find something big, the French will first argue for the continuation </p>
<p>of inspections; but if it is a plausible smoking gun, and it is clear the US (and we) are </p>
<p>committed to military action, again they will probably commit to a second resolution </p>
<p>and to take part. But they will try everything to find alternatives …</p>
<p>“If there is no major obstruction and no smoking gun, France will oppose a second </p>
<p>resolution (while trying to avoid having to veto) and stay out of military action, </p>
<p>though they would probably at the end of day try to sound neutral … Continuing </p>
<p>Iraqi deception and only passive co&#8209;operation … will almost certainly not be enough </p>
<p>to persuade them to change this in the short term …”</p>
<p><b>626. </b> Sir John wrote:</p>
<p>“As things stand, there is a relatively narrow window of circumstances in which </p>
<p>the French would take part fully in military action: a clear <i>casus belli</i> and a second </p>
<p>resolution. This looks to me possible in the next few weeks but not probable. Short </p>
<p>of that, they will not go with the Americans, though they could stop short of outright </p>
<p>opposition and be ready to do something to help eg backfilling.”</p>
<p><b>627. </b> Sir John added that “The consequences for France of not being there if the US go </p>
<p>are painful for them to contemplate”, including being on the wrong side of the argument </p>
<p>if the action is an obvious rapid success. But:</p>
<p>“There would be consolations if the Americans had no or few allies … And if it all </p>
<p>went wrong, they would be on the right side of the argument.”</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Addressing the implications for UK policy, Sir John wrote that “the gap between </p>
<p>the Prime Minister’s convictions and Chirac’s is, for the present, unbridgeable”. He saw </p>
<p>“no alternative to massaging our differences … and staying within shouting distance of </p>
<p>each other”.</p>
<p><b>629. </b> Sir John concluded that, if the UK and the French (and Germans) diverged over </p>
<p>military action, the consequences would depend:</p>
<p>“… on the circumstances and the success of the war. But the implications for the </p>
<p>successful pursuit of our European policy … could be severe … So if any chance </p>
<p>emerges in the next few weeks of bringing our positions together, we should grab </p>
<p>it with both hands.”</p>

<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>630.  In advance of the Security Council meeting on 27 January, Mr Straw and the </b></p>
<p><b>FCO were concerned to identify a strategy which would allow more time for the </b></p>
<p><b>strategy of coercion to work.</b></p>
<p><b>631. </b> Mr Straw visited Washington and repeated the political arguments for trying </p>
<p>to get a second resolution on 23 January.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the inspectors’ reports to the Security </p>
<p>Council on 27 January, the need to “shift the burden of proof to Iraq” and the need to </p>
<p>ensure there were no differences between the US and UK.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>633. </b> Mr Straw made the case for a second resolution in his subsequent meeting with </p>
<p>Mr Dick Cheney, US Vice President, telling him that “the key question was how to </p>
<p>navigate the shoals between where we were today and a possible decision to take </p>
<p>military action”.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> The UK would be “fine” if there was a second resolution; and that it </p>
<p>would be “ok if we tried and failed (a la Kosovo). But we would need bullet&#8209;proof jackets </p>
<p>if we did not even try”. In response to Vice President Cheney’s question whether it would </p>
<p>be better to try and fail than not to try at all, Mr Straw said the former.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> In the subsequent discussion, Mr Straw stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The composition of the Security Council since 1 January “made matters </p>
<p>more difficult”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If there were “a half decent statement” from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei (to the </p>
<p>Security Council on 27 January), “which enumerated Iraqi shortcomings, we </p>
<p>would have the beginnings of a further material breach as defined by OP4 of </p>
<p>[resolution] 1441. We could then use a period of time – weeks not months – to </p>
<p>negotiate a second resolution.” The text of such a resolution would “write itself”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The effort of getting a second resolution “would help the UK and – he thought – </p>
<p>the US to nail the canard that the US was operating outside the international </p>
<p>community. It would also help with the ‘day&#8209;after’.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair “felt strongly that diplomatic effort could make the military effort </p>
<p>easier. If the international community was united, then the Arabs could go to </p>
<p>Saddam with a strong message that he had either to go or his regime would </p>
<p>face destruction. Arab leaders were desperate to get rid of Saddam. A second </p>
<p>resolution would embolden them.” If the international community was split, that </p>
<p>would “embolden Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>People in the UK had a “sense of the UN as a legitimator of action”. </p>
<p>Vice President Cheney said the same was true in the US.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Vice President Cheney made a number of points, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A French veto “wouldn’t hurt one bit in the States”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had felt “bushwhacked” at the meeting of the Security Council </p>
<p>on 20 January, and the position of Germany was “increasingly fragile”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US Administration “had not yet figured out next steps”, which would </p>
<p>“to some extent” depend on what happened on 27 January.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It “would clearly be preferable to get a second resolution”. There was a “sense </p>
<p>in the US that a process was unfolding”, “But there was no prospect of the </p>
<p>inspectors working properly unless the party inspected was willing. The burden </p>
<p>of proof was on the Iraqis and they were not delivering.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “a timing problem. The idea that we could let it drift through months </p>
<p>of discussion was not on. Troops were already in place. The weather was a </p>
<p>factor … If we backed off now, or sat there for months, the Saudis and others </p>
<p>would back off. It would be one more example of bold talk and no action. We </p>
<p>would never get them gingered up for action again.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush “could not let a charade continue at the UN”; and he “could not </p>
<p>let France and Germany dictate policy”. He would have thought France had “a </p>
<p>vested interest … in preserving the status of the Security Council”, but “Instead, </p>
<p>they were allowing the Council to be a place not of action but of restraining </p>
<p>legitimate US action.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Once military operations started, “the Iraqi regime was likely to fall apart quickly”: </p>
<p>“Iraqis would reveal all the WMD now hidden away.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US Administration “had not yet resolved” whether it wanted a second vote </p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p><b>636. </b> At the end of the meeting, Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“… discussed the Kosovo model and its limitations. The tactics of tabling a text in the </p>
<p>knowledge of a likely veto were very delicate. But we might also face the situation </p>
<p>where France or Germany tabled a resolution to give the inspectors more time. </p>
<p>We would have to veto but that would put us on the back foot. Last autumn, the </p>
<p>knowledge that the US and UK had a text in play had deterred others from tabling an </p>
<p>alternative [...] …”</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Mr Straw’s comments on proceeding with military action if the UK tried and </p>
<p>failed to obtain a second resolution prompted Mr Wood to write to Mr Straw.</p>

<p><b>638. </b> On a flight from Washington on 23 January, Mr Ricketts, gave Mr Straw an outline </p>
<p>of a strategy which Mr Blair could put to President Bush.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p><b>639. </b> The key messages were that the strategy was working, but it needed more time. </p>
<p>That would have three strategic advantages:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The military build&#8209;up was “already producing signs of fracturing in the regime … </p>
<p>We might be able to achieve our objectives without firing a shot”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inspections “were beginning to produce results”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was working with “moderate Arabs” to “get Saddam out using the </p>
<p>leverage of a second resolution”.</p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Ricketts stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the present circumstances, it was clear that there would not be the nine votes </p>
<p>in the Security Council needed for a second resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Without a “dramatic new fact”, Mr Ricketts did not see how a second resolution </p>
<p>could be achieved “in the next few weeks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“UK politics [made] it essential to have a second resolution”.</p>
<p><b>641. </b> In Mr Ricketts’ view, the US and UK had to “contrive the circumstances” in which </p>
<p>they could “carry a broad coalition and domestic opinion with us. Going without the UN </p>
<p>carried the big price of resentment in the Muslim world, including increased terrorism/ </p>
<p>risk of being stuck for years with the burden of rebuilding post&#8209;Saddam Iraq.” Working </p>
<p>with the UN would allow Iraq to be “rebuilt with international support” which would allow </p>
<p>the UK “to exit”, and would be a “powerful message for other would&#8209;be proliferators. That </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There was a need “if we could possibly get it” for “hard proof” that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was “lying over his WMD, to bring public opinion to accept the need </p>
<p>for military action”; and that inspections would need to be given time.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In their planned meeting (on 31 January), Mr Blair would seek to convince </p>
<p>President Bush to delay a decision to start military action for a few weeks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Confirmation was needed that the assumption that the Arabs, and in particular </p>
<p>the Saudis, would only favour military action on the basis of a second resolution, </p>
<p>was correct.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “extra time should be used to maximise the chances of the inspectors </p>
<p>finding a smoking gun or of being seriously obstructed (the inspectors should be </p>
<p>encouraged to inspect sites which we knew the Iraqis would want to block)”.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>but a series of regular Blix reports that he was not satisfied with the level of Iraqi </p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S NOTE TO PRESIDENT BUSH, 24 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>651.  In a Note to President Bush on 24 January, Mr Blair told President Bush that </b></p>
<p><b>the need for a second resolution was overwhelming, and that inspectors should </b></p>
<p><b>be given until the end of March or early April to carry out their task.</b></p>
<p><b>652.  Mr Blair suggested that, in the absence of a “smoking gun”, Dr Blix would </b></p>
<p><b>be able to harden up his findings on the basis of a pattern of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation </b></p>
<p><b>from Iraq and that would be sufficient for support for military action in the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>653.  In addition, Mr Blair framed his argument in the context that extra time would </b></p>
<p><b>be crucial to make a better case and work up coherent plans for the “aftermath” </b></p>
<p><b>of a conflict and to secure international support.</b></p>
<p><b>654. </b> Mr Blair sent a Note to President Bush on 24 January, setting out the dilemma, </p>
<p>as he saw it, in the absence of a “smoking gun”.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>655. </b> Addressing the question “What’s the problem?”, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“If we delay, we risk Saddam messing us about, sucking us back into a game of hide </p>
<p>and seek with the Inspectors where, unless they find ‘the smoking gun’, the thing </p>
<p>drags on for ever until we give up or get distracted.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, at present there is not support for a second UN resolution; and </p>
<p>Blix is not yet in a clear and unambiguous position on Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation.”</p>
<p><b>656. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the arguments for proceeding with the second resolution, “or at </p>
<p>the very least a clear statement” from Dr Blix which allowed the US and UK to argue that </p>
<p>a failure to pass a second resolution was in breach of the spirit of 1441, remained in his </p>
<p>view, overwhelming. He cited six reasons:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “the best protection” in the event of “a military hitch” or a </p>
<p>protracted campaign.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Given the risk of casualties, military and civilian, “doing this in the context of </p>
<p>international opposition would be very tough”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Arab opinion wanted “it done”, and wanted “it done quickly”, but they were </p>
<p>assuming a second resolution: “Without one they will be in a real bind, especially </p>
<p>if parts of Europe, Russia, China, etc were all vociferous in their opposition.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would be “emboldened by a lack of international support for us </p>
<p>and weakened by its existence”. If he believed international opinion was against </p>
<p>the US and UK, he might hunker down in Baghdad.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Internecine fighting in Iraq when a military strike destabilised the regime would </p>
<p>be the “biggest risk”: “They are perfectly capable, on previous form, of killing </p>
<p>each other in large numbers.” The US and UK “would need the backing of the </p>
<p>international community and preferably the UN to handle it”; without that the </p>
<p>US and UK would “get the blame for any fighting”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If they forfeited the UN route, the US and UK would lose the high ground. </p>
<p>They had “invested huge capital” in that and it had given everyone “a big </p>
<p>comfort blanket”. If that were taken away, it would be “about US power, naked </p>
<p>and in your face”. There were “big majorities against action without UN backing </p>
<p>everywhere, even in the UK” and “even in the UK Cabinet”. That would be “so </p>
<p>in spades” if the UN inspectors appeared to be asking for more time and the </p>
<p>US and UK were refusing.</p>
<p><b>657. </b> Addressing the “way through”, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“In truth, the world is in contradiction. No one is really prepared for war, except us. </p>
<p>But equally no one believes Saddam is telling the truth. In part we are victims of our </p>
<p>own success. Your strength … has forced Saddam to let inspectors back in; has </p>
<p>made him seem weak and back in his box. So, everyone asks: why bother?</p>
<p>“But they also know, deep down, WMD is an issue and that given half a chance </p>
<p>Saddam would be at it again. And they don’t want, ideally to fall out with the US. </p>
<p>But to avoid falling out, they need some cover.”</p>
<p><b>658. </b> Mr Blair described the position of France and Germany as being that the inspectors </p>
<p>were in Iraq “to play hide and seek”, and “they should stay as long as it takes for them to </p>
<p>find anything without any obligation on Saddam other than not to hinder them”.</p>
<p><b>659. </b> The “true view”, however, was that resolution 1441 gave Iraq a “duty” to </p>
<p>“co&#8209;operate fully: not just in access, but in being open, honest and transparent about </p>
<p>where WMD was and actively helping the inspectors to seize and destroy it”. Dr Blix </p>
<p>accepted that view:</p>
<p>“… if things carry on as they are, then he will say that there is not full co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>though there is not either the absence of any co&#8209;operation; but as he continues </p>
<p>to demand Iraq fully co&#8209;operates and they continue to refuse, this pattern of </p>
<p>non&#8209;co&#8209;operation – even in the absence of any ‘smoking gun’ is sufficient for him </p>
<p>to harden up his findings; and I think it will be sufficient for us.”</p>

<p>117</p>
<p><b>660. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“ie in the US/UK view, the failure … fully to co&#8209;operate is enough now and technically </p>
<p>we are right. 27 January should be crunch time. But we won’t carry other people … </p>
<p>However, if Blix carries on reporting non&#8209;co&#8209;operation, makes increasing demands, </p>
<p>and hardens his findings with each stage, I think we will carry people – even without </p>
<p>the ‘smoking gun’ – shortly.”</p>
<p><b>661. </b> Mr Blair stated that military action starting at the end of March/early April would not </p>
<p>be “a big military problem”: “But the extra time could be crucial in carrying international </p>
<p>opinion” with the US and the UK, provided they had defined clearly the true role of the </p>
<p>inspections and Dr Blix was behind the proposal.</p>
<p><b>662. </b> Mr Blair’s proposal was for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a report on 27 January stating that Dr Blix was not satisfied and identifying </p>
<p>specific questions for Iraq to address;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US and UK to set out “the true role” of the inspectors and get Dr Blix’s </p>
<p>support, saying that they believed “Iraq is in breach but even so, out of </p>
<p>deference to allies, we are prepared to give the inspectors some time”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix to agree to report every two weeks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US and UK to make it clear that, if by the time of the late March report there </p>
<p>was not a definitive change of Iraqi attitude, the US and UK would take the issue </p>
<p>back to the UN and expect action; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regular reports from Dr Blix in February and March to build “a clear pattern </p>
<p>of deceit”.</p>
<p><b>663. </b> Mr Blair argued that the disadvantages of that strategy would be military delay but </p>
<p>“only, effectively, for a month”. The advantages would be “huge”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK could “build a case based on the Inspectors not just our own </p>
<p>judgement”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix might find “the smoking gun”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam “might crack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would be “a far better chance of a second resolution” which would give </p>
<p>them “a clear run with public support”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Saudis and other Arabs could “build support for their strategy to push </p>
<p>Saddam out”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would provide time, which Mr Blair believed was needed, “to work up more </p>
<p>coherent post&#8209;Saddam and ‘aftermath’ plans”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would also provide time “to make a bigger case on WMD and the link </p>
<p>with terrorism”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>664. </b> Mr Blair concluded: “In parallel we should of course maintain our rhetoric and step </p>
<p>up military preparations.”</p>
<p><b>665. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the Note was “a very well made, carefully constructed </p>
<p>argument that made sense”, and that President Bush had read it before the telephone </p>
<p>call with Mr Blair.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>666. </b> Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice about the Note.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> He reported that it was clear </p>
<p>that the White House had a different perspective about the advantages of moving to </p>
<p>military action as soon as possible and the importance of a second resolution, including </p>
<p>for securing support from Arab governments.</p>
<p><b>667.  In his subsequent conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair pursued the </b></p>
<p><b>proposals in his Note and explained his political difficulties.</b></p>
<p><b>668. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush later that day, he set out the strategy </p>
<p>in his Note and his view on the dilemma they faced.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> The international community </p>
<p>was “not yet ready” for a second resolution, but an operation without one would be </p>
<p>“much tougher”.</p>
<p><b>669. </b> Mr Blair said that it was possible that the inspectors would find a smoking gun, </p>
<p>but he was “not relying on that”. In his view, even if there were no smoking gun and the </p>
<p>Iraqis were giving the inspectors access, Dr Blix:</p>
<p>“… would say that they were not co&#8209;operating sufficiently. Saddam had to co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>actively with identifying and destroying all his WMD … So in our view Saddam was </p>
<p>already in breach of 1441. But the international community was in denial. Our case </p>
<p>would strengthen if there were a series of Blix reports that Iraq was not co&#8209;operating. </p>
<p>We needed to give the inspectors more time to firm up the case.”</p>
<p><b>670. </b> Mr Blair proposed setting a clear deadline. Unless there were full co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>by then, we would seek a second resolution: “If this were not achievable, military action </p>
<p>would follow anyway.” Military preparations and diplomatic work to build international </p>
<p>support should continue.</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Later Mr Blair argued that “we needed to look reasonable” and that the deadline </p>
<p>for the start of military action should be delayed to the end of March.</p>
<p><b>672. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had been clear that there was no international </p>
<p>political support “without Blix finding a smoking gun and we needed more time”. </p>
<p>The inspectors should be given another month. Mr Blair was “sure that in time we could </p>
<p>turn opinion”. President Bush was “pretty clear there would have to be war, because </p>

<p>he did not believe Saddam would ever comply, or that the inspectors would be allowed </p>
<p>to do their job”.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>673. </b> The record of the discussion confirms Mr Campbell’s account.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>674. </b> In response to a question from Mr Campbell about whether he thought President </p>
<p>Bush “had basically decided there was going to be a war,” Mr Blair had said “if that call </p>
<p>was anything to go by, pretty much”, Mr Blair hoped that “he could keep things on a </p>
<p>multilateral track but it was not going to be easy. He was facing a very tough call indeed, </p>
<p>about as tough as they get.”</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>675. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair “was confident that we could get Bush to the </p>
<p>position where he stayed [action] long enough for a second UNSCR”; and that there </p>
<p>was also “a real danger that the Attorney General would resign if he thought the plan </p>
<p>was disproportionate force”.</p>
<p><b>676. </b> Mr Campbell reported that Mr Blair had told a political Cabinet on 24 January that </p>
<p>“it was important to stay with the Americans”. He had emphasised “closeness as a way </p>
<p>of influencing the debate there” and said “he wanted to do a big … diplomacy round” </p>
<p>before his meeting with President Bush. Mr Blair had also:</p>
<p>“… set out what he saw as the political and other realities. He felt that Bush </p>
<p>deserved praise for showing strength in forcing Saddam to the position of getting </p>
<p>the inspectors in, but … we didn’t have enough international support and we needed </p>
<p>time to build it.”</p>
<p><b>677. </b> Describing the political Cabinet on 24 January, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Prescott </p>
<p>had said more Cabinet Committee discussion on policy was needed.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> In a conversation with Mr de Villepin on 24 January, Mr Straw said that it was </p>
<p>“important for everyone to keep to the process” set out in resolution 1441.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> That was </p>
<p>“the guide against which we could test whether the inspectors had been able to do their </p>
<p>job or not”. He restated the UK’s preference for a second resolution.</p>
<p><b>679. </b> Mr Straw said that “how France played its hand had major consequences”. It was </p>
<p>vital to take the UN route. Citing the League of Nations in the 1930s, he said that “failure </p>
<p>by the UN would lead to questions about its legitimacy”. After complaining about the </p>
<p>US approach, Mr de Villepin stated that if in the end it was decided force was needed, </p>
<p>“France would join in”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>INDICT</b></p>
<p>INDICT was established in 1996.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> Although it was UK based, the non&#8209;governmental </p>
<p>organisation (NGO) operated with funding from the US Congress granted under the </p>
<p>auspices of the Iraq Liberation Act 1998. INDICT advocated the establishment of an </p>
<p>ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal to try Saddam Hussein and leading members </p>
<p>of his regime on charges of genocide and torture, war crimes and other crimes against </p>
<p>humanity. Founder members included a number of notable Iraqi exiles including </p>
<p>Dr Ahmed Chalabi and Mr Hamid Al Bagali (who was later appointed Iraqi Ambassador </p>
<p>to the UN), and Ms Clwyd.</p>
<p>INDICT focused its attention on Saddam Hussein and a dozen senior members of the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime including Mr Tariq Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>Ms Clwyd wrote to Lord Williams of Mostyn, the Attorney General, in September 2000, </p>
<p>enclosing a copy of Leading Counsel’s opinion which advised that there was “a powerful </p>
<p>body of evidence that Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz were party to, and criminally </p>
<p>responsible for … detentions” and that there was “direct evidence that implicates Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein and Tariq Aziz in issuing threats to detain the hostages”.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>Counsel advised that, subject to the consent of the Attorney General being obtained, </p>
<p>both Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz could be charged in the UK with the offence of </p>
<p>Hostage Taking, contrary to section 1 of the Taking of Hostages Act 1982. That was an </p>
<p>offence prosecutable in the UK whether committed “in the United Kingdom or elsewhere” </p>
<p>regardless of the nationality of the offender.</p>
<p>Lord Williams wrote to Ms Clwyd on 22 March 2001 notifying her of his refusal to grant his </p>
<p>consent to the prosecution.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> He explained the basis of his decision as:</p>
<p>“I have concluded in respect of Saddam Hussein that there is at present no realistic </p>
<p>prospect of a conviction. There are two elements to my assessment. I have </p>
<p>concluded that Saddam Hussein, as Head of State of Iraq, would presently be </p>
<p>entitled to assert immunity from criminal prosecution. Moreover, I am not satisfied </p>
<p>in any event that the evidence as submitted to me is sufficient to provide a realistic </p>
<p>prospect of a conviction.</p>
<p>“Whether the court would uphold any claim of immunity that may be asserted by </p>
<p>Tariq Aziz is in my judgement less clear. However, leaving that issue aside, I am </p>
<p>not satisfied that the evidence at present submitted by INDICT provides a realistic </p>
<p>prospect of conviction for the offences which appear to me to fall to be considered.”</p>
<p>In October 2002, INDICT submitted further advice from Leading Counsel to </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, again seeking consent to the prosecution of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, Tariq Aziz and on this occasion two others, Mr Ali Hassan Al&#8209;Majid </p>

<p> All were alleged to have committed offences of hostage&#8209;taking in 1990.</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith wrote to Ms Clwyd on 24 January 2003.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> He stated that he was </p>
<p>not prepared to consent to a prosecution on the “theoretical possibility” that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s “current immunity could at some point lapse” particularly, in the light of </p>
<p>the Yerodia</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> decision which implied that the formal grant of his consent might itself </p>
<p>contravene the basis of his immunity. Lord Goldsmith was not satisfied, moreover, that </p>
<p>the evidence submitted by INDICT provided a realistic prospect of conviction.</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith did not express a view as to whether Tariq Aziz might continue to enjoy </p>
<p>immunity. In his case, and with regard to Ali Hassan Al&#8209;Majid and Taha Ramadan, he did </p>
<p>not consider the evidence to be sufficiently cogent or persuasive for there to be a realistic </p>
<p>prospect of a conviction and Lord Goldsmith refused consent in each case.</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith closed his letter with the following paragraph:</p>
<p>“My conclusions on the material provided, focus only on the question of exercising </p>
<p>criminal jurisdiction against individuals in the domestic courts. They have nothing </p>
<p>to do, of course, with the quite separate question of whether the international </p>
<p>community may in due course consider it worthwhile to establish an international </p>
<p>tribunal, depending on how the international situation develops. An international </p>
<p>tribunal can be set up on a basis that overrides Sovereign immunity. But this is not </p>
<p>a matter for me and it would not be right for me to speculate as to how the situation </p>
<p>will develop over the next few weeks or months.”</p>

<p><b>680.  Mr Blair decided to use an interview on <i>Breakfast with Frost</i> on 26 January </b></p>
<p><b>to set out the position that the inspections should be given sufficient time to </b></p>

<p>237</p>
<p><b>682. </b> Asked whether Dr Blix should be given more time, Mr Blair stated that the </p>
<p>inspectors had “to be given the time to do the job”, but there was “confusion” about what </p>
<p>that job was. The time they needed was to certify whether Saddam Hussein was “fully </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating or not”. Saddam had to provide information on “exactly what weapons </p>
<p>material” he had, “allowing the inspectors to inspect it, monitor it and shut it down”. </p>
<p>If they were not able to do that job, Saddam would have to be disarmed by force. That </p>
<p>should not take months, but Saddam was not co&#8209;operating.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>683. </b> Pressed as to whether non&#8209;compliance rather than evidence of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction justified “a war”, Mr Blair replied that he “profoundly” disagreed with the idea </p>
<p>that a refusal to co&#8209;operate was of a “lesser order”. He added:</p>
<p>“… what we know is that he has this material … we know there is something </p>
<p>like 350 tonnes of chemical warfare agent. We know there is something like </p>
<p>30,000 special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t even told us where those old leftovers from 1998 are … we know … that </p>
<p>there is an elaborate process … of concealment …</p>
<p>“… the people that the inspectors want to interview … are being told, by the Iraqi </p>
<p>authorities, they can only come for interviews with an Iraqi … minder, and only be </p>
<p>interviewed in certain places.</p>
<p>“And we know also from intelligence that these people’s families are being told that </p>
<p>if they co&#8209;operate and give any information at all they will be executed.</p>
<p>“… if he fails to co&#8209;operate in being honest and he is pursuing a programme of </p>
<p>concealment, that is every bit as much a breach as finding, for example, a missile </p>
<p>or chemical agent.”</p>
<p><b>684. </b> Asked whether there would be “another dossier” setting out what UK intelligence </p>
<p>had discovered, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… we have the intelligence that says that Saddam has continued to develop these </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction; that what he’s doing is using a whole lot of dual&#8209;use </p>
<p>facilities in order to manufacture chemical and biological weapons; and … that there </p>
<p>is an elaborate programme of concealment … forcing the inspectors to play a game </p>
<p>of hide and seek.”</p>
<p><b>685. </b> Asked if he had sufficient evidence to back action, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… I’ve got no doubt at all that he’s developing these weapons and that he poses </p>
<p>a threat but we made a choice to go down the UN route …</p>
<p>“… our judgement, the American judgement … is that Saddam has these weapons, </p>
<p>but the purpose of the inspectors … is … to report back to the UN and say whether </p>
<p>he is fully co&#8209;operating or he’s not.”</p>
<p><b>686. </b> Asked whether a second resolution was needed, required or preferred, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Of course we want a second resolution and there is only one set of circumstances </p>
<p>in which I’ve said that we would move without one … all this stuff that … we’re </p>
<p>indifferent … is nonsense. We’re very focused on getting a UN resolution …</p>
<p>“… you damage the UN if the UN inspectors say he is not co&#8209;operating, he’s in </p>
<p>breach, and the world does nothing about it. But I don’t believe that will happen …”</p>

<p>123</p>
<p><b>687. </b> Mr Blair reiterated his arguments that the world had to take a stand to disarm Iraq </p>
<p>so as to send a message to other countries that were potentially developing weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction that they had to take the international community seriously. Delay </p>
<p>would make it more difficult to deal with the issue: in his view it was “only a matter of </p>
<p>time before international terrorism and these types of weapons come together”.</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Asked what was the most important item on the agenda for his meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“To agree the right strategy for the future and to … explain … yet again why it is </p>
<p>important to deal with this issue.”</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Mr Blair concluded in relation to Iraq that:</p>
<p>“… when America is taking on these tough and difficult questions our job is to be </p>
<p>there. Not be there at any price, not be there without saying how we think the thing </p>
<p>should be dealt with, but being there in the difficult and tricky times, not simply … </p>
<p>as fair weather friends.”</p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Scarlett and SIS1 provided material for use during the interview. This is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>691. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that the UK problem was that President Bush </p>
<p>“seemed hell&#8209;bent on war and we looked like we were doing things from a US not </p>
<p>UK perspective”.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>692. </b> Mr Campbell added on 27 January: “Despite yesterday people were still applying </p>
<p>the yardstick that the inspectors would have to find WMD rather than simply that </p>
<p>Saddam had to co&#8209;operate.”</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>693.  Mr Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, told Mr Blair on 27 January that </b></p>
<p><b>inspections needed more time.</b></p>
<p><b>694. </b> President Putin contacted Mr Blair on 27 January to discuss the differences in </p>
<p>the international community’s approach to North Korea and Iraq.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> On the former, the </p>
<p>strategy was to pursue a negotiation, including contacts between the US and North </p>
<p>Korea. Mr Blair agreed to discuss that with President Bush, and that:</p>
<p>“We need to bind the North Koreans into an agreement that preserved their dignity </p>
<p>while ensuring that they could not develop their weapons.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>695. </b> On Iraq, President Putin’s view was that the purpose of the military build up was </p>
<p>to put pressure on Iraq, not a preparation for war. Russia was doing the same through </p>
<p>diplomatic means and had managed to ensure that the Iraqis gave permission for </p>
<p>scientists to go abroad to be interviewed and searches of private homes. UNMOVIC and </p>
<p>the IAEA had some questions, but they were procedural, there were no complaints that </p>
<p>Iraq was interfering with the inspections. The inspectors should be allowed to continue </p>
<p>their work. He trusted the inspectors and they should be given more time.</p>
<p><b>696. </b> Mr Blair agreed that the inspectors should have time to do their job, but it </p>
<p>was “crucial” that it “did not become a game of hide and seek”. Iraq had to help the </p>
<p>inspectors; Saddam Hussein was obliged to give them positive co&#8209;operation, not just </p>
<p>access. He would discuss the issues with President Bush and then speak to President </p>
<p>Putin again.</p>
<p><b>697. </b> President Putin emphasised that it was a very important conversation and </p>
<p>concluded that Saddam Hussein should comply with all his obligations and the </p>
<p>inspectors’ requests; he must accommodate our demands. Moscow was not interested </p>
<p>in covering for Iraq if it had weapons or was seeking to acquire them. If Iraq had any </p>
<p>weapons, they must destroy them and comply with the inspectors.</p>
<p><b>698. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the call was “encouraging”; President Putin was “really </p>
<p>losing patience with Saddam”.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p><b>699. </b> In an interview before the reports to the Security Council on 27 January, Mr Igor </p>
<p>Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, told Al Jazeera that he strongly doubted </p>

<p><b>702. </b> In his report to the Security Council on 27 January, Dr Blix rehearsed the </p>
<p>disarmament process since 1991 and identified three “important questions” for the </p>
<p>Security Council:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[H]ow much [prohibited material and activity] might remain undeclared and </p>
<p>intact from before 1991”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[W]hat, if anything, was illegally produced or procured after 1998, when the </p>
<p>inspectors left”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How to prevent “any weapons of mass destruction be[ing] produced or procured </p>
<p>in the future”?</p>
<p>243</p>
<p><b>703. </b> Dr Blix reported on UNMOVIC’s activities and gave an assessment of the extent </p>
<p>of Iraq’s co&#8209;operation with those activities, including its declaration of 7 December 2002.</p>
<p><b>704. </b> Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC shared “the sense of urgency felt by the [Security] </p>
<p>Council to use inspection as a path to attain, within a reasonable time verifiable </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq”. UNMOVIC’s capability was “growing”. It had 260 staff members </p>
<p>of whom 100 were inspectors. It had conducted about 300 inspections at more than </p>
<p>230 sites, of which 20 were sites which had not been inspected before. A training </p>
<p>programme in Vienna would create a pool of 350 qualified experts from which inspectors </p>
<p>could be drawn.</p>
<p><b>705. </b> Dr Blix reported: “It would appear from our experience so far that Iraq has decided </p>
<p>in principle to provide co&#8209;operation on process, namely access.” Iraq had “on the whole </p>
<p>co&#8209;operated rather well so far … access has been provided to all sites that we wanted </p>
<p>to inspect and with one exception it has been prompt”. There had, however, been “some </p>
<p>problems” in two areas: Iraq’s refusal to guarantee the safety of U2 flights to provide </p>
<p>aerial imagery and for surveillance during inspections; and helicopter operations, </p>
<p>although that had been “solved”. There had also been “some recent disturbing incidents </p>
<p>and harassment”.</p>
<p><b>706. </b> Dr Blix stated that an Iraqi decision to provide co&#8209;operation on substance was </p>
<p>“indispensible” to bring “the disarmament task to completion”. OP9 of resolution 1441 </p>
<p>required Iraqi co&#8209;operation to be “active”. It was “not enough to open doors”. Inspection </p>
<p>was “not a game of ‘catch as catch can’. Rather … it is a process of verification for the </p>
<p>purpose of creating confidence.”</p>
<p><b>707. </b> Dr Blix reported: “In the fields of missiles and biotechnology, Iraq’s declaration </p>
<p>contains a good deal of new material and information covering the period from 1998 </p>
<p>and onward. This is welcome.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>708. </b> But Dr Blix stated:</p>
<p>“One might have expected … that Iraq might have tried to respond to, clarify and </p>
<p>submit supporting evidence regarding the many open disarmament issues, which </p>
<p>the Iraqi side should be familiar with from the UNSCOM document S/1999/94 of </p>
<p>January 1999 and the so&#8209;called Amorim Report of March 1999 … These are the </p>
<p>questions which UNMOVIC, governments and independent commentators have </p>
<p>often cited.”</p>
<p><b>709. </b> UNMOVIC had found “the issues listed in those two documents as unresolved, </p>
<p>professionally justified”. The reports pointed to:</p>
<p>“… lack of evidence and inconsistencies … which must be straightened out, if </p>
<p>weapons dossiers are to be closed … They deserve to be taken seriously by Iraq </p>
<p>rather than being brushed aside as evil machinations of UNSCOM. Regrettably, </p>
<p>the … declaration, most of which is a reprint of earlier documents, does not </p>
<p>seem to contain any new evidence that would eliminate the questions or reduce </p>
<p>their number.”</p>
<p><b>710. </b> Dr Blix set out examples of questions and issues that needed to be addressed </p>
<p>in some detail, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had information indicating that Iraq had worked on purifying and </p>
<p>stabilising the nerve agent VX, and had achieved more than it had declared. </p>
<p>This conflicted with the Iraqi account that the agent had only been produced </p>
<p>on a pilot scale, had been destroyed in 1991, and was never weaponised. There </p>
<p>were also questions to be answered about the fate of VX precursor chemicals.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had provided a copy of the “Air Force” document it had withheld in 1998. </p>
<p>It indicated that 13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi Air Force </p>
<p>between 1983 and 1988. Iraq had claimed that 19,500 bombs were consumed </p>
<p>during that period. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, UNMOVIC “must </p>
<p>assume these quantities are now unaccounted for”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The discovery of “a number of 122mm chemical rocket warheads in a bunker at </p>
<p>a storage depot southwest of Baghdad”. The bunker was relatively new, which </p>
<p>meant “the rockets must have been moved there in the past few years, at a time </p>
<p>when Iraq should not have had such munitions”. Iraq had stated that they were </p>
<p>“overlooked from 1991 from a batch of 2,000 that were stored there during the </p>
<p>Gulf War. That could be the case. They could also be the tip of a submerged </p>
<p>iceberg. The discovery of a few rockets does not resolve, but rather points to, </p>
<p>the issue of several thousands of chemical rockets that are unaccounted for.” </p>
<p>Iraq had subsequently found four more chemical rockets at a storage depot in </p>
<p>al&#8209;Taji. The warheads were “empty”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inspectors had found “a laboratory quantity of thiodiglycal, a mustard </p>
<p>gas precursor”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared, </p>
<p>and that at least some of this was retained after the declared destruction date. </p>
<p>It might still exist.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had not declared “a significant quantity of bacterial growth media” which had </p>
<p>been included in Iraq’s submission to the Amorim panel. This omission appeared </p>
<p>“to be deliberate as the pages of the resubmitted document were renumbered”. </p>
<p>The quantity of growth media involved would “suffice to produce … about </p>
<p>5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Al Samoud 2 and Al Fatah missiles “might well represent <i>prima facie</i> cases </p>
<p>of proscribed systems” but further technical consideration would be necessary </p>
<p>before reaching a conclusion on the issue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had refurbished its missile production infrastructure, including a number </p>
<p>of casting chambers which were capable of producing motors for missiles with </p>
<p>ranges greater than the 150km limit.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had illegally imported 300 rocket engines which might be for the </p>
<p>Al Samoud 2, chemicals used in propellants and other potentially </p>
<p>proscribed items.</p>
<p><b>711. </b> Dr Blix questioned Iraq’s claims that there were no more documents about its </p>
<p>activities. After the discovery of documents in the home of a scientist “relating to the </p>
<p>laser enrichment of uranium”, UNMOVIC could not “help but think that the case might </p>
<p>not be isolated and that such placements of documents is deliberate to make discovery </p>
<p>difficult”. He warned that: “Any further sign of the concealment of documents would </p>
<p>be serious.”</p>
<p><b>712. </b> Dr Blix also questioned whether Iraq had provided a complete list of the names of </p>
<p>personnel who had worked on proscribed programmes, and pointed out the difficulties of </p>
<p>interviewing individuals “in private”. He reported that UNMOVIC had asked 11 individuals </p>
<p>for interview in Baghdad and that none of them would speak without the presence of an </p>
<p>Iraqi official.</p>
<p><b>713.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had found no evidence that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>revived its nuclear weapons programme but it was still investigating a number </b></p>
<p><b>of issues and Iraq needed to shift from passive to pro&#8209;active support.</b></p>
<p><b>714.  Dr ElBaradei called for a few months to verify Iraq’s nuclear disarmament </b></p>
<p><b>and to demonstrate that the inspection process worked as a central feature of </b></p>
<p><b>the international nuclear arms control regime.</b></p>
<p><b>715. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had conducted 139 inspections at some </p>
<p>106 locations, with a “focus on areas of concern identified by other States, facilities </p>
<p>identified through satellite imagery as having been modified or constructed since 1998, </p>
<p>and other inspection leads identified independently”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>ready access and to clarify the nature of the activities” at those facilities. “No prohibited </p>
<p>nuclear activities” had been identified.</p>
<p><b>716. </b> Dr ElBaradei described the Iraqi declaration as “consistent with our understanding </p>
<p>of Iraq’s pre&#8209;1991 nuclear programme”. Iraq had not provided “any new information </p>
<p>relevant to … questions which had been outstanding since 1998”. While those questions </p>
<p>did “not constitute unresolved disarmament issues”, further clarification was needed.</p>
<p><b>717. </b> The IAEA had been conducting “exhaustive analysis of supporting information”. </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei also reported difficulties in securing private interviews with the three </p>
<p>individuals the IAEA had approached.</p>
<p><b>718. </b> Iraq’s unsuccessful attempts to procure high&#8209;strength aluminium tubes which </p>
<p>Iraq had indicated were related to a programme to reverse engineer conventional </p>
<p>rockets, had been a particular focus. The IAEA had concluded that the tubes “would be </p>
<p>consistent with” use in a conventional rocket programme. They “would not be suitable </p>
<p>for manufacturing centrifuges” without modification. The IAEA was “still investigating” the </p>
<p>issue, but the attempt to acquire such tubes was “prohibited” by resolution 687 (1991).</p>
<p><b>719. </b> The IAEA was investigating how “dual&#8209;use” material had been relocated or used, </p>
<p>including the “HMX” high explosive which had been removed from IAEA seals at the end </p>
<p>of 1998. Dr ElBaradei stated that it would be difficult to verify how that had been used.</p>
<p><b>720. </b> The IAEA was investigating reports of Iraqi efforts to import uranium but it did </p>
<p>“not have enough information, and … would appreciate more”.</p>
<p><b>721. </b> Dr ElBaradei stated that the IAEA had “begun in the last few weeks to receive </p>
<p>more actionable information from States”, and he called on those that “had access to </p>
<p>such information to provide it … so that the inspection process can be accelerated and </p>
<p>additional assurances generated”.</p>
<p><b>722. </b> Dr ElBaradei emphasised the need for Iraq to “shift from passive support … to </p>
<p>pro&#8209;active support”. He cited as an example the retrieval of documents relating, “in </p>
<p>part, to Iraq’s pre&#8209;1991 efforts to use laser technology for enriching uranium”. It was </p>
<p>“urgent and essential” for Iraq “on its own initiative, to identify and provide any additional </p>
<p>evidence that would assist the inspectors in carrying out their mandate”.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> Dr ElBaradei warned that there was:</p>
<p>“… a window of opportunity that may not remain open for very much longer. Iraq </p>

<p>past activities”.</p>
<p><b>725. </b> Dr ElBaradei concluded:</p>
<p>“… we have to date found no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme since the elimination of the programme in the 1990s … [O]ur work is </p>
<p>steadily progressing and should be allowed to run its natural course … [W]e should </p>
<p>be able within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no </p>
<p>nuclear weapons programme. These few months … would be a valuable investment </p>
<p>in peace because they could help us avoid a war. We trust that we will continue </p>
<p>to have the support of the Council … to verify Iraq’s nuclear disarmament through </p>
<p>peaceful means and to demonstrate that the inspection process can and does work </p>
<p>as a central feature of the international nuclear arms control regime.”</p>
<p><b>726. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, in subsequent informal consultations of the </p>
<p>Council, there was general scepticism that Iraq had “co&#8209;operated adequately”, but also </p>
<p>a desire for more time.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>727. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Negroponte had delivered a pre&#8209;prepared </p>
<p>statement saying that there was nothing in either Dr Blix or Dr ElBaradei’s reports which </p>
<p>gave hope that Iraq ever intended to comply with resolution 1441 and that the time was </p>
<p>fast approaching when the Security Council would have to demonstrate it meant what it </p>
<p>had said.</p>
<p><b>728. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that the Council had heard “a catalogue of unresolved </p>
<p>questions”. The “onus was on Iraq to prove the zero it had declared” and to provide </p>
<p>“substantive evidence”. Iraqi co&#8209;operation had been “limited and grudging” and </p>
<p>looked like “a carefully considered policy of withholding information and obstruction”. </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA needed to conduct more intrusive inspections and “carry out </p>
<p>more productive interviews to unravel the facts”.</p>
<p><b>729. </b> At a later meeting, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had provided answers to specific </p>
<p>points raised in the informal discussion, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix had complained about the number of Iraqi minders for inspections.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been demonstrations during inspections but UNMOVIC had not </p>
<p>been intimidated.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix felt that there was a determination at a high level to co&#8209;operate on </p>
<p>process but “on substance, Iraq simply said the outstanding questions were </p>
<p>nonsensical”. Unless that changed, he was “not optimistic of solutions”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Denial of access to a private house would be a serious matter.</p>

<p>Dr ElBaradei said that the documents found at a private home “looked like a </p>

<p>must be taken through the Security Council. Iraq was co&#8209;operating so far but:</p>
<p>“… if Iraq begins to create problems for the inspectors, Russia can change its </p>

<p>There were “a lot of unclear questions” remaining about chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons. He criticised Iraqi officials who had stated that Iraq might attack Kuwait </p>
<p>in the event of a war. That did not promote “the necessary conditions for continuing </p>
<p>political efforts to settle the Iraq situation”. Russia was firmly opposed to military action </p>
<p>both against Iraq and from its territory. Unilateral action against Iraq would split the </p>
<p>anti&#8209;terrorist coalition. Russia would direct its efforts to “thinking how to avoid a veto” and </p>
<p>finding a solution that would preserve the important unity of the Security Council. If Iraq </p>

<p>132</p>
<p><b>Extracts from President Bush’s State of the Union address, </b></p>
<p><b>28 January 2003</b></p>
<p>President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America </p>
<p>and the world, is outlawed regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, </p>
<p>and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who </p>
<p>would use them without the least hesitation.</p>
<p>“This threat is new; America’s duty is familiar …</p>
<p>“America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers …</p>
<p>“Different threats require different strategies …</p>
<p>“Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean peninsula and </p>
<p>not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator with a history </p>
<p>of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not </p>
<p>be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.</p>
<p>“Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein … agreed to disarm … For the next 12 years, </p>
<p>he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological and </p>
<p>nuclear weapons … Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these </p>
<p>weapons – not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even </p>
<p>cruise missiles strikes on his military facilities.</p>
<p>“… the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to </p>
<p>disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt … The … UN inspectors … were not </p>
<p>sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials … The job of the inspectors </p>
<p>is to verify that Iraq’s regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is </p>
<p>hiding his banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy </p>
<p>them as directed. Nothing like this has happened.</p>
<p>“The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons </p>
<p>sufficient to produce over 25,000 litres of anthrax – enough doses to kill several </p>
<p>million people. He hasn’t accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that </p>
<p>he has destroyed it.</p>
<p>“The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had material sufficient to </p>
<p>produce more than 38,000 litres of botulinum toxin …</p>
<p>“Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce </p>
<p>as much as 500 tonnes of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent …</p>
<p>“US intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions </p>
<p>capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them – </p>
<p>despite Iraq’s recent declaration denying their existence …</p>
<p>“From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile </p>
<p>biological weapons labs …</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>“The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program … The British </p>
<p>Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities </p>
<p>of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to </p>
<p>purchase high&#8209;strength aluminium tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has </p>
<p>much to hide.</p>
<p>“The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary; he is deceiving. From </p>
<p>intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel </p>
<p>are at work hiding documents and materials from the UN inspectors, sanitising </p>
<p>inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany </p>
<p>inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.</p>
<p>“Iraq is blocking U2 surveillance flights … Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the </p>
<p>scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached </p>
<p>by Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>has ordered scientists who co&#8209;operate with UN inspectors … will be killed, along with </p>
<p>their families.</p>
<p>“Year after year, Saddam has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, </p>
<p>taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction … The only possible </p>
<p>explanation, the only possible use … is to dominate, intimidate or attack.</p>
<p>“With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly </p>
<p>havoc in that region. And this Congress and the America[n] people must recognise </p>
<p>another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and </p>
<p>statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects </p>
<p>terrorists, including members of Al Qaida. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could </p>
<p>provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own.</p>
<p>“Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could </p>
<p>be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are </p>
<p>not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers … armed by Saddam Hussein …</p>
<p>“Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent … If this threat is </p>
<p>permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions or words, or recriminations </p>
<p>would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is </p>
<p>not a strategy, and it is not an option.</p>
<p>“The dictator who is assembling the world’s most dangerous weapons has already </p>
<p>used them … International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used </p>
<p>in the torture chambers of Iraq …</p>
<p>“… tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: your enemy </p>
<p>is not surrounding your country – your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he </p>
<p>and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.</p>
<p>“The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious </p>
<p>and mounting threat to our country …</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>134</p>
<p>“We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: if Saddam Hussein does not </p>
<p>fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead </p>
<p>a coalition to disarm him.”</p>
<p><b>742. </b> President Bush also announced that the US would ask the UN Security Council </p>
<p>to convene on 5 February to “consider the facts of Iraq’s ongoing defiance”; and that </p>
<p>Secretary Powell would “present information and intelligence about Iraq’s … illegal </p>

<p>be realistic: “Time would not achieve anything without the co&#8209;operation we expected.” </p>
<p>Iraq had: not given “access to its illegal WMD programmes”; “allowed omissions in the </p>

<p><b>755.  Reflecting previous difficulties, Sir David Manning and Sir Christopher </b></p>

<p> </p>
<p>He was accompanied by Sir Richard Dearlove.</p>
<p><b>759. </b> Sir David Manning reiterated many of the points he had made in previous </p>
<p>conversations with Dr Rice.</p>
<p><b>760. </b> Sir David reported that he had informed Dr Rice that, without a second resolution, </p>
<p>Mr Blair would not be able to secure Cabinet and Parliamentary support for military </p>
<p>action; and that he could be forced from office if he tried: “The US must not promote </p>
<p>regime change in Baghdad at the price of regime change in London.” Mr Blair was not </p>
<p>asking for much time: “weeks not months” and action beginning at the end of March.</p>
<p><b>761. </b> Sir David reported that the UK was significantly less optimistic than the US about </p>
<p>the current level of support for a second resolution authorising military action and the </p>
<p>prospects for increasing that support. The UK was anxious not to give the impression </p>
<p>that inspections were running out of time; that was needed for more reports from Dr Blix </p>
<p>which would carry much more weight internationally than the US and UK view. Mr Blair </p>
<p>was in a very different position from President Bush, who already had Congressional </p>
<p>authority to act.</p>
<p><b>762. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove had “briefed in detail on our intelligence” which the </p>
<p>US Administration “clearly find very impressive”.</p>
<p><b>763. </b> Sir David had “spelt out the political realities about Iraq extremely bluntly”. </p>
<p>He thought that the US had accepted a second resolution would be needed but there </p>
<p>was no agreement to wait until the end of March. Mr Blair would need to “stick very </p>
<p>strongly to the arguments in your Note” and to “spell them out in a way that leaves no </p>
<p>scope for … ‘interpretation’”. A late March date would mean a pretty intensive timetable. </p>
<p>He suggested that one possibility would be to review the position again after Dr Blix’s </p>

<p><b>765. </b> Reporting on the mood in Washington for Mr Blair’s visit, Sir Christopher Meyer </p>
<p>advised:</p>
<p>“It is politically impossible for Bush to back down from going to war in Iraq this </p>

<p>“The target of Bush’s messianic appeal was … the anxious and unconvinced in </p>
<p>the country at large … The call to rally to the flag, the President and to the military </p>
<p>should, on past precedent, evoke an emotional and positive response …</p>
<p>“… The novel element was the promise that Powell would produce fresh evidence </p>
<p>of collaboration between Saddam and Al Qaida. For the White House, the key </p>
<p>to the questions ‘Why Iraq, why now?’ has always been the rogue state/WMD/</p>
<p>terrorism nexus: not as a worrying possibility in future years, but as a clear and </p>

<p>“… if Powell goes off at half&#8209;cock, it will only reinforce, as Jeremy Greenstock has </p>

<p>will be routed by an early and easy military victory. He is very much influenced by … </p>
<p>[the fact] that in the past the US has failed to respond forcibly to multiple provocation </p>

<p>“Unless we have some good ideas for sending Saddam into exile, Mr Blair’s task on </p>

<p>That means securing the time to assemble the largest possible coalition both for the </p>
<p>war itself and for the aftermath. If the notorious smoking gun can be found, this will </p>
<p>make things much easier …</p>
<p>“Bush does not look to have the patience to let Blix make the case. I said in an </p>
<p>earlier report that exhausting the UN route was likely to mean different things in </p>
<p>Washington and London. Bush is undecided about a second resolution: whether </p>
<p>it will be worth going for and, if it is, what should be put in it. In other words – as </p>

<p><b>776.  President Chirac told Mr Blair that he would not support war unless </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein did something unacceptable.</b></p>
<p><b>777. </b> In a conversation later on 28 January, President Chirac told Mr Blair that the </p>
<p>French position had not changed; they were “against war, unless Saddam did something </p>
<p>unacceptable”.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> Although Dr Blix had reported that Iraq was not co&#8209;operating, </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei had reported good co&#8209;operation. War was “always the worst outcome”. </p>
<p>Iraq had very little WMD compared with North Korea. The desire to preserve the </p>
<p>transatlantic link had to be balanced against the costs of a war.</p>
<p><b>778. </b> Mr Blair and President Chirac agreed that the inspectors should be given more </p>
<p>time. President Chirac thought that the inspectors would find nothing; Mr Blair said it </p>
<p>would be “serious if the inspectors continued to report insufficient co&#8209;operation, e.g. if </p>
<p>the Iraqis refused interviews or denied proper access”. They agreed that, “in that case, </p>
<p>a second resolution would come into play”.</p>
<p><b>779. </b> President Chirac welcomed Mr Blair’s offer to speak again after his meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p><b>780. </b> Mr Rycroft commented that President Chirac appeared:</p>
<p>“… to be positioning himself to support a second resolution if the inspectors find </p>
<p>WMD or are denied access. But his straight ‘non’ to the Prime Minster’s question </p>
<p>about continued Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation shows the problem we shall have with the </p>
<p>French if we are in the scenario of arguing that a pattern of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation is a </p>
<p>material breach of 1441.”</p>
<p><b>781. </b> A minute from Sir David Manning to Mr Blair records that President Chirac had </p>
<p>refused to accept a phone call from Mr Blair for the preceding two weeks.</p>

<p><b>782. </b> Mr de Villepin spoke twice to Mr Straw on 29 January.</p>
<p><b>783. </b> In the first conversation, Mr de Villepin questioned why military action should </p>
<p>be used against Iraq when 20&#8209;30 other countries had chemical weapons. It was </p>
<p>hard to explain the threat posed by Iraq when there was almost no risk from the </p>
<p>nuclear programme.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>784. </b> Mr Straw’s response focused on the process in resolution 1441 agreed by the </p>
<p>UK and France. In his view, there were “two key questions”:</p>
<p>“… was there a material breach and what action should the international community </p>
<p>take. Blix’s report had shown that Iraq was in material breach according to the </p>

<p>definition set out in OP4. There had been plenty of material breaches in the past </p>
<p>which had not led to military action. But, as UNSCR 1441 set out, if there were a </p>
<p>further material breach then Iraq would face serious consequences. This could only </p>
<p>mean military action.”</p>
<p><b>785. </b> Mr de Villepin responded that, as politicians, he and Mr Straw had to show how </p>
<p>military action corresponded to the threat. The issue of material breach had to be faced.</p>
<p><b>786. </b> Mr Straw countered that “just because the international community was not taking </p>
<p>action against other states was not an argument for inaction against Iraq”; and taking </p>
<p>action against Iraq “would be a deterrent to other countries”. In his view it would be </p>
<p>“possible to avoid military action only if the international community remained united </p>
<p>in telling Iraq to comply”.</p>
<p><b>787. </b> In the second conversation, Mr de Villepin expressed surprise about the joint </p>
<p>article signed by eight European Prime Ministers which Mr Blair had not mentioned </p>
<p>to President Chirac.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>788. </b> Mr Straw told Mr de Villepin that at the time resolution 1441 was agreed, “everyone </p>
<p>knew that a further material breach would trigger a meeting of the Security Council”. </p>
<p>Mr de Villepin did not agree with Mr Straw’s view that Iraq “had committed a further </p>
<p>material breach”. Mr Straw argued that resolution 1441 had:</p>
<p>“… agreed a 60&#8209;day inspection period. Blix had then reported. There would be </p>
<p>further discussions in the Security Council. If Iraq changed its behaviour, then good. </p>
<p>If not, military action would become inevitable …”</p>
<p><b>789. </b> Mr de Villepin had stated that France would never be placed in a position where </p>
<p>it would agree to a second resolution simply as window dressing for military action; it </p>
<p>wanted time to allow the build&#8209;up of pressure to work. The US timeframe was too short.</p>
<p><b>790. </b> Mr Straw said:</p>
<p>“… the more the inspectors found a pattern of non&#8209;compliance, the greater the </p>
<p>suspicion surrounding Saddam’s WMD …</p>
<p>“It would be terrible if, in the case of a clear further material breach, the international </p>
<p>community did nothing. It was in no one’s interest to see the US act unilaterally. </p>
<p>That would mean the international community losing influence over US actions.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>792.  Sir Roderic Lyne advised that Russia would vote in favour of a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution in response to a “smoking gun”; but that it might support or abstain </b></p>
<p><b>on a resolution based on reports of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation.</b></p>
<p><b>793. </b> In a telegram on 30 January, Sir Roderic Lyne advised that Russia was “not  </p>
<p>nearly as steamed up about Iraq” as France and Germany.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> President Putin’s </p>
<p>attitude was “based on a pragmatic assessment of Russia’s interests – which means </p>
<p>avoiding war if possible, but more importantly not falling out with the Americans and </p>
<p>avoiding marginalisation at the UN”. Russia was “not talking veto language” and </p>
<p>President Putin’s remarks were beginning “to prepare public opinion for a vote in favour </p>
<p>[of a second resolution]”.</p>
<p><b>794. </b> Sir Roderic wrote that Russia was “in the ‘most opposed’ group in the Security </p>
<p>Council” but Moscow was “not signalling real determination to make difficulties or hold </p>
<p>out to the end – rather the opposite”. The mood was “a mixture of pragmatism and sullen </p>
<p>acquiescence in a presumed outcome”.</p>
<p><b>795. </b> The evidence for those conclusions set out by Sir Roderic included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The official Russian line before the reports to the Security Council, about the </p>
<p>need for more time and that military action would not be justified, was “ritualistic, </p>
<p>carefully moderated and designed not to box Russia in (nor to whip up public </p>
<p>emotions)”. President Putin’s remarks in Kiev had “changed the tune sharply”. </p>
<p>Mr Igor Ivanov had “swung into line”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Putin had told Mr Blair “two years ago that he would not regret </p>
<p>the passing of Saddam Hussein”, and he had not “pressed hard” since </p>
<p>resolution 1441.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“THE FRANCO&#8209;RUSSIAN SYMPHONY” wasn’t playing: “Before 1441, Chirac </p>
<p>and Villepin were burning up the phone lines to Moscow, and Lavrov and Levitte </p>
<p>[Mr Jean&#8209;David Levitte, French Permanent Representative to the UN] were (for </p>
<p>a while) in bed together in New York. It feels different this time.” That was partly </p>
<p>because “the Russians thought the French welshed on them in the 1441 end </p>
<p>game”. The larger point was that President Putin knew that Iraq was the “litmus </p>
<p>test” for his strategic relationship with President Bush. President Putin’s visit </p>
<p>to France and Germany from 9&#8209;11 February might “well create the impression </p>
<p>of a common front, but under the surface it isn’t so”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Almost no one” in Russia wanted to see a war in Iraq. The “Russian body </p>
<p>politic” was “acutely uncomfortable with US hyperpower and Russian impotence” </p>
<p>but there was “less heat” about Iraq than “in France, Germany or Western </p>
<p>Europe in general”. No one was forecasting that President Putin would “break </p>
<p>with the Americans”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Keeping the oil price high (though not extreme) and avoiding a post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>collapse” was a key Russian interest.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia was “not trying any” political initiatives. It seemed to have “put some </p>
<p>pressure” on Iraq, but relations were “not warm”.</p>
<p><b>796. </b> Sir Roderic advised that Russia would:</p>
<p>“… tuck in behind the French and Germans in the Security Council, with the </p>
<p>Chinese, but not lead the pack. They’ll support more time for inspections, calls </p>
<p>for proof positive, and ploys to get Saddam to concede or step down.</p>
<p>“They will not veto in isolation; probably not veto in Chinese company alone; and in </p>
<p>general will do all they can to avoid vetoing. They would rather let through (perhaps </p>
<p>on abstention) a distasteful second UNSCR than see the Americans go unilaterally </p>
<p>and sideline the Security Council. They would vote in favour of a ‘smoking gun’ </p>
<p>resolution and in favour or abstain (depending on the French vote) on a resolution </p>
<p>based on reports from Blix of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation.</p>
<p>“… It would be awkward but not completely impossible for Putin domestically </p>
<p>to be more US&#8209;friendly in a vote than … [Germany or France].</p>
<p>“… If the US goes unilateral, the Russians will make a decent show of grumbling … </p>
<p>but they won’t be actively obstructive.”</p>
<p><b>797. </b> Sir Roderic concluded that the UK approach should be: “More of the same.” </p>
<p>The UK “should help the Americans to keep the Russians engaged, including on </p>
<p>day after issues”. This meant continuing conversations with Russians, including with </p>
<p>President Putin and Mr Igor Ivanov. The “bottom line” was that President Putin would </p>
<p>not want:</p>
<p>“… to lose the chips he’s staked on Bush. Iraq versus the USA is a no brainer. </p>
<p>(Nor does Putin wish to part company with us, in the run&#8209;up to his State Visit.)”</p>
<p><b>798.  Mr Straw told Mr Igor Ivanov that the question of a material breach was </b></p>
<p><b>for the Security Council or individual members. He accepted that resolution 1441 </b></p>
<p><b>had not set a timetable for inspections.</b></p>
<p><b>799. </b> The record of Mr Igor Ivanov’s telephone call to Mr Straw on the afternoon of  </p>

<p>144</p>
<p><b>800. </b> Mr Straw agreed that most problems in Dr Blix’s report:</p>
<p>“… could be resolved if Iraq complied. But there could be no doubt that Iraq was </p>
<p>in further material breach because of its non&#8209;compliance. It was important that </p>
<p>Iraq got the message that time had almost run out. It would be stupid of them not </p>
<p>to co&#8209;operate now.”</p>
<p><b>801. </b> Questioning Mr Straw’s statement, Mr Ivanov said: “it was up to the inspectors </p>
<p>to say how much time they needed to complete their mission. If they needed five to six </p>
<p>months, who were we to say they should not get it.”</p>
<p><b>802. </b> Mr Straw “accepted” that there was nothing in resolution 1441 on the timing. That </p>
<p>was: “a matter for the Security Council. But Iraq should have complied over the past two </p>
<p>months, or even in the 1990s.”</p>
<p><b>803. </b> Mr Ivanov agreed that:</p>
<p>“… it was for the Security Council to decide on timing … [T]he previous inspectors </p>
<p>had worked for eight years and done a great job. ElBaradei had told … [him] that he </p>
<p>needed two more months. Blix needed more time too. The Security Council could </p>
<p>give the inspectors time to finish their job.</p>
<p>“… the Blix report had said nothing about a material breach.”</p>
<p><b>804. </b> Mr Straw said:</p>
<p>“… material breach was not a matter for the inspectors, but for the Security Council </p>
<p>or for individual members. If one looked at OP4 … it was very hard to see how Iraq </p>
<p>was not now in further material breach.”</p>
<p><b>805. </b> Mr Ivanov agreed that:</p>
<p>“… it was for the Security Council to decide if there were a further material breach. </p>
<p>But, looking at the Blix and ElBaradei reports, Russia saw no reason to declare </p>
<p>that Iraq was in material breach. But there was a definite need to seek further </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation from Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>806.  The JIC assessed on 29 January that retaining WMD was a vital Iraqi </b></p>

<p><b>or go into exile.</b></p>

<p><b>conduct terrorist operations.</b></p>
<p><b>809. </b> At the request of the FCO, the JIC reviewed current developments in Iraq from </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s perspective and possible Iraqi moves in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>810. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion on 29 January record that the draft Assessment </p>

<p>ensure it reflected the latest information, especially the UNMOVIC perspective.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> They </p>
<p>also recorded that:</p>
<p>“… it was difficult to predict if and when Saddam might launch pre&#8209;emptive strikes, </p>
<p>but the paper should try and make a judgement on possible timescales. The trigger </p>
<p>would probably be set when Saddam concluded that his fate was sealed, rather </p>
<p>than any movements by Coalition Forces. Most of the Iraqi military would probably </p>
<p>crumble quickly under attack. Saddam would maintain his hold on of power until </p>
<p>then, and there were no indications of possible coups beforehand. Whilst the Iraqi </p>
<p>public might welcome the end of Saddam’s regime, they were also concerned about </p>
<p>the human costs of fighting.”</p>
<p><b>811. </b> The key elements of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq: The Emerging View from Baghdad’</b></p>
<p><b>Key Judgements</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Retaining WMD remains a vital Iraqi interest. Saddam might nevertheless </p>
<p>consider a last minute tactical declaration of some of his WMD to avert a war, </p>
<p>believing that he can rebuild his WMD capability later.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam does not appear to realise the severity of the military attack he faces. </p>
<p>Senior Iraqi officials, although increasingly convinced of the inevitability of a </p>
<p>US&#8209;led attack, are unlikely to be telling Saddam about their concerns.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam has not lost control or the capacity for rational tactical decisions. He </p>
<p>continues to maintain regime cohesion, primarily through intimidation. He is </p>
<p>unlikely to agree to relinquish power or to go into exile. He still believes he has </p>
<p>a chance of averting military action or, once military action begins, forcing the </p>
<p>Coalition to cease hostilities before his regime collapses.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once military action has begun, widespread lack of loyalty to the regime will </p>
<p>become clear. Iraqis may not welcome Coalition military forces, but most will at </p>
<p>least acquiesce in Coalition military activity to topple the regime, as long as civilian </p>

<p>Minutes, 29 January 2003, JIC meeting. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam probably believes he has some strong political and military cards to </p>
<p>play, even in the face of an inevitable attack. These include exploiting international </p>
<p>divisions over war with Iraq and rousing the Arab street. He may use human </p>
<p>shields, fire CBW against Coalition Forces, launch a pre&#8209;emptive attack on the </p>
<p>Kurds, Coalition Forces building up in Kuwait or Israel, or sabotage Iraqi oil wells </p>
<p>and water supply.”</p>
<p><b>Inspections</b></p>
<p>The JIC had “judged in October” that:</p>
<p>“Saddam was confident he could prevent UNMOVIC from finding any evidence </p>
<p>before military options started to close off … and that concealment and dispersal </p>
<p>of sensitive items were the basis of Iraq’s strategy. [...] But by mid&#8209;January there </p>
<p>were signs that Iraq was coming under pressure from UNMOVIC finds that were </p>
<p>inconsistent with its December 2002 declaration. [...]</p>
<p>“[...] Intelligence is unclear, but it is possible the UNMOVIC discoveries have </p>
<p>increased Iraqi uncertainty. Blix’s tough statement to the Security Council on </p>
<p>27 January surprised Baghdad and may have increased the regime’s concerns about </p>
<p>UNMOVIC. Saddam Hussein continues to believe that the possession of WMD is a </p>
<p>vital Iraqi interest. [...] Any WMD admission would therefore be tactical rather than </p>
<p>indicative of a genuine change of policy.”</p>
<p><b>Reading the outside world</b></p>
<p>The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi officials were “<b>increasingly convinced of the inevitability of a US&#8209;led </b></p>
<p><b>military attack</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein continued to “give the impression that military action, though </p>
<p>increasingly likely,” was “not imminent”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s speeches in early January had been “bellicose, calling for </p>
<p>bravery and sacrifice in defending the homeland from invaders”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “not clear that Saddam and his officials” had “fully grasped the severity of </p>
<p>the military attack they face from the US&#8209;led Coalition assembling in the Gulf”. [...]</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Reporting … indicated” that Iraq believed the West was “squeamish about </p>
<p>casualties”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “<b>misreading the international scene</b>”. Media reporting of </p>
<p>debate in the West might “well lead him to overestimate the impact of opposition </p>
<p>to military action on US determination to deal decisively with him”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein might “also be unsure whether the aim of the Coalition [was] </p>
<p>regime change and disarmament or just disarmament”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “continued to seek support from Russia and China as well as Arab and </p>
<p>Muslim states. But such attempts to gather Arab and international support  </p>
<p>appear overambitious.”</p>

<p><b>Iraq and terrorism</b></p>
<p>Addressing Iraq’s capability to conduct terrorist attacks and its possible intentions, the </p>
<p>Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC continued to judge that Iraq’s capability to conduct terrorist attacks was </p>
<p>“limited, especially outside the Gulf region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “previously judged that terrorism could be attempted against Coalition </p>
<p>Forces during a military build&#8209;up if Saddam believed an attack was inevitable. </p>
<p>There [had] been no indication that Iraq was behind the recent attack on US </p>
<p>contractors … in Kuwait”. That had, however, highlighted “the vulnerability of the </p>
<p>large numbers of Coalition Forces concentrated in an area as small as Kuwait”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq might “well seek to use its influence over some smaller militant Palestinian </p>
<p>groups to encourage them to strike at US and Coalition interests in the Middle </p>
<p>East in the event of a Coalition attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “also uncorroborated reports of Iraq assembling teams in various </p>
<p>countries to attack UK and US interests in the event of war against Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite the presence of terrorists in Iraq with links to Al Qaida, there was </p>
<p>“no intelligence of current co&#8209;operation between Iraq and Al Qaida”.</p>
<p><b>Iraqi military preparations</b></p>
<p>The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “continuing military defensive preparations, including deployments </p>
<p>and reinforcement of military units in the South, West and along the border of the </p>
<p>Kurdish autonomous zone” which appeared to be “directed against both the threat </p>
<p>of [an] internal uprising and external attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Since early January part of the Iraqi 4th Corps has moved southwards, including </p>
<p>possibly 1,000 troops on the al&#8209;Faw Peninsula, apparently in response to the </p>
<p>Coalition build&#8209;up in Kuwait.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>But Iraq’s options for redeployment in the South were “limited”: “Any significant </p>
<p>redeployment in the South would risk triggering a Coalition attack by breaching </p>
<p>the southern No&#8209;Drive Zone.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The regime did “not trust the Republican Guard enough to deploy them in  </p>
<p>Baghdad, except possibly as a last resort, leaving them exposed beyond the  </p>
<p>capital’s boundaries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi preparations in and around Baghdad were judged to be “of limited utility”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “no clear indication of any plan for a pre&#8209;emptive military strike </p>
<p>against the Kurds, neighbouring countries or Israel”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would have “little incentive to launch such a strike while the  </p>
<p>Iraqi strategy focuses on convincing UNMOVIC that Iraq does not have WMD </p>
<p>holdings”, but it might “become an attractive option in the face of imminent </p>
<p>Coalition military action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “unlikely” to be “any advance warning of a pre&#8209;emptive attack on the </p>
<p>Kurds”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “pre&#8209;emptive limited artillery strike on Kuwait using CBW could be launched in </p>
<p>as little as two hours”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Preparations for a possible attack on Israel” were “likely to be more extensive and </p>
<p>to stretch Iraqi capabilities to the limit”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were indications of “plans to sabotage oil fields to prevent them falling into </p>
<p>Coalition hands”.</p>
<p><b>Maintaining control within Iraq</b></p>
<p>The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The regime continued to “<b>maintain regime cohesion primarily through </b></p>
<p><b>intimidation</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had “attempted to maintain its hold by claiming” that the return of inspectors had </p>
<p>“averted a US attack”; the international community was “intent on disarming Iraq, </p>
<p>not on regime change”; the regime was “maintaining ‘business as usual’: anybody </p>
<p>thinking of deserting will face serious consequences”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Clear signs of dissent or defection might not be seen until the regime was “about </p>
<p>to fall”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had “sought to mitigate the regime’s unpopularity by promising </p>
<p>some measures of liberalisation”. Such measures had “little credibility” as the </p>
<p>regime had “made them under pressure in the past, then withdrawn them once the </p>
<p>crisis has passed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “little intelligence on Iraqi popular attitudes towards a Coalition attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that “most Iraqis will welcome the departure of Saddam. A few </p>
<p>reports suggest that some Iraqis may fight to defend their homeland from what </p>
<p>they see as external aggression. [...] Overall we judge that <b>while Iraqis may not </b></p>
<p><b>welcome military forces, they will at least acquiesce in Coalition military </b></p>
<p><b>action to topple the regime, as long as civilian casualties are limited.</b>”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Morale in much of the regular army was “low” and “many soldiers” were “reluctant </p>
<p>to fight”. “But as long as Iraqi security officers remain with military units and able </p>
<p>to enforce discipline, fear of execution is likely to keep regular units at their posts.”</p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein’s mindset</b></p>
<p>The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that Saddam Hussein was “<b>still in control</b>” and was “<b>unlikely to </b></p>
<p><b>relinquish power voluntarily</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would “fear the humiliation of exile, possible assassination and </p>
<p>the threat of trial before an international war crimes tribunal”. Suggesting to him </p>
<p>“that he step down to avert a war would be likely to provoke a murderous rage”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The prospects for a “Turkish initiative to promote a regional peace plan” did not </p>
<p>“look good”. There had been “no indication” that Saddam was “preparing to flee”. </p>
<p>There had been “uncorroborated reports of plans for Saddam’s family to seek </p>
<p>refuge abroad in the event of a Coalition attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “under increasing pressure” as the inspections regime </p>
<p>intensified, UNMOVIC had made “significant discoveries” and the Coalition military </p>
<p>build&#8209;up continued.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that Saddam Hussein had “underestimated UNMOVIC’s capability </p>
<p>to expose his deception”. He had “failed to realise that he was facing a situation </p>
<p>different from the days of UNSCOM”. UNMOVIC’s “limited success” highlighted </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>the “risks Saddam took in providing a weak declaration of Iraq’s WMD&#8209;holdings”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “<b>no sign</b>” that Saddam Hussein was “<b>unstable or losing the capacity </b></p>
<p><b>to make rational tactical decisions</b>”. He might “<b>well believe</b>” that he had “<b>some </b></p>
<p><b>strong cards left to play</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “already placing military targets in residential areas to score </p>
<p>a propaganda victory in the event of a Coalition air campaign”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the face of an attack, or even before hostilities if he judged that an attack was </p>
<p>imminent,” Saddam Hussein might take a number of actions, including:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>making a last&#8209;minute declaration of his WMD;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>taking hostages or exploiting “foreign volunteers from countries such as UK </p>
<p>and France as human shields”;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>moving “against the KAZ [Kurdish Autonomous Zone] to provoke a </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis and to provide a military distraction”;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>mounting a pre&#8209;emptive attack against Israel to “provoke a wider regional </p>
<p>crisis and rouse the Arab street”; and</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>inflicting “high enough casualties on any Coalition ground forces, perhaps in </p>
<p>Kuwait, including through use of CBW, to halt a Coalition attack and to swing </p>
<p>public opinion in the West against hostilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once hostilities were underway”, Saddam might also:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>“seek to cause an international outcry over the level of Iraqi or Coalition </p>
<p>casualties”; and</p>
<p>  – </p>
<p>“pursue a scorched earth policy, including the destruction of oil wells and </p>
<p>poisoning the water supply”.</p>
<p>The JIC had judged in December 2002 that Saddam Hussein “would initially seek </p>
<p>international pressure to halt Coalition action”. If that failed, he “would seek to inflict </p>
<p>serious casualties on Iraq’s neighbours and on Coalition Forces, in order to undermine the </p>
<p>Coalition’s will to fight on”.</p>
<p>In its Assessment of 29 January, the JIC judged that Saddam Hussein still believed he had </p>
<p>“a chance of averting military action or, once military action begins, forcing the Coalition to </p>
<p>cease hostilities before his regime collapses”.</p>
<p><b>812.  Mr Scarlett assured Sir David Manning on 30 January that the intelligence </b></p>
<p><b>reporting was “consistent and convincing”, and there was no evidence that </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein was considering the renunciation of WMD.</b></p>
<p><b>813. </b> In addition to the JIC Assessment of 29 January, Mr Scarlett sent Sir David </p>
<p>Manning his “personal observations on the overall intelligence picture”.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett </p>
<p>wrote: “Our intelligence reporting has been consistent and convincing. I have not seen </p>
<p>a single reference to Saddam even considering the renunciation of WMD to save his </p>
<p>regime (and probably his own life).”</p>

<p><b>814. </b> The details in the letter are addressed in Sections 4.3 and 6.2.</p>
<p><b>Cabinet, 30 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>815.  Mr Blair held a meeting with senior Ministers to discuss Iraq before Cabinet </b></p>
<p><b>on 30 January, but there is no official record of what was discussed or the </b></p>
<p><b>conclusions reached.</b></p>
<p><b>816. </b> Iraq was discussed with Mr Prescott, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce </p>
<p>in a meeting before Cabinet.</p>
<p><b>817. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had told Mr Blair several times that he had to make clear [to </p>
<p>President Bush] that the UK could not go ahead without a resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw was also concerned about Lord Goldsmith’s reaction to some </p>
<p>of the proposed targets for the air campaign, “because he would feel that </p>
<p>disproportionate force was being applied”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce had “warned that he was worried the Americans felt they would </p>
<p>be seen as liberators. It just wasn’t so. They would be resented.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair was “clear that he wanted” to get President Bush to a second resolution; </p>
<p>and he had “got the message that we couldn’t do without one”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair felt that “two or three Blix reports, and more time for Arab leaders </p>
<p>to push Saddam out” were needed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon was “worried”; Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Secretary of Defense, </p>
<p>was saying “that the problem with the UN route was that it was open&#8209;ended, </p>
<p>that other countries just used the process so nothing ever happened”.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>818. </b> There is no No.10 record of the discussion.</p>
<p><b>819.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 30 January that he would be discussing the </b></p>
<p><b>policy on Iraq with President Bush the following day. Saddam Hussein was </b></p>
<p><b>not co&#8209;operating fully and while the inspectors would need time to reach </b></p>
<p><b>a firm conclusion, that period could not be open&#8209;ended.</b></p>

<p> The United Nations inspectors “needed </p>
<p>to be given clear direction following their report” to the Security Council on 27 January. </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “not co&#8209;operating fully but the pressure on him to do so was </p>
<p>increasing. It would take time for the inspectors to come to a firm conclusion, but that </p>

<p>151</p>
<p><b>821. </b> In the subsequent discussion, the points made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix’s report could be interpreted as an argument that containment had </p>
<p>worked: more explanation was required why we could not continue as before.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The onus was on Saddam Hussein to explain the discrepancies between the </p>
<p>Iraqi declaration and a series of unanswered questions: “about 223 missile </p>
<p>motors imported illegally; the production of VX nerve agent; 6,500 missing </p>
<p>chemical bombs; 12 newly stored chemical shells; and the refusal to allow </p>
<p>[Iraqi] scientists to be interviewed in private” listed by Dr Blix. Resolution 1441 </p>
<p>“demanded Iraqi co&#8209;operation: it was not for the inspectors to act like detectives </p>
<p>to find evidence of Saddam Hussein’s guilt”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The British public was “supportive of the UN route, but was averse to being </p>
<p>rushed into war by pressure from the US”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military action could precipitate a humanitarian crisis involving internecine strife, </p>
<p>the release of Iraqi WMD or the breakdown of the UN Oil&#8209;for&#8209;Food programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The military build&#8209;up continued and there would be announcements on the </p>
<p>call&#8209;up of Reservists and the Royal Air Force contribution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The importance of reviving the MEPP had to be constantly reinforced with </p>
<p>the US.</p>
<p><b>822. </b> Mr Blair concluded that Saddam Hussein “had the choice of either co&#8209;operating </p>
<p>or being disarmed”. The UN route “should be pursued”. “More time was needed” to </p>
<p>allow the inspectors “to do their job properly and to ensure broad international support”. </p>
<p>American rhetoric was “weakening the Iraqi regime from within. If military action was </p>
<p>required we would need to make clear our commitment to the people of Iraq and to </p>
<p>managing the aftermath of hostilities to their benefit. The UN would need to be involved </p>
<p>in that process. Military action would be embarked upon only if necessary to enforce the </p>
<p>will of the United Nations.”</p>
<p><b>823. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had been “clear that his role was to pull the US </p>
<p>into the right position” on a UN resolution; and that he had later left Cabinet to take a call </p>
<p>from President Bush, “from which he returned looking very worried”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>826.  While Mr Blair had proposed on 24 January that inspections, and fortnightly </b></p>
<p><b>reports to the Security Council should continue until the end of March, the </b></p>
<p><b>timetable being discussed on 30 January was that a decision on a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution could be sought after more reports from Dr Blix.</b></p>
<p><b>827. </b> In his diary for 29 January, Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“For obvious reasons, Iraq was worrying TB more and more. He wasn’t sure </p>
<p>Bush got just how difficult it was going to be without a second UNSCR, for the </p>
<p>Americans as well as us. Everyone TB was speaking to, including tough guys like </p>
<p>[John] Howard, was saying that they need a second resolution or they wouldn’t get </p>
<p>support. TB felt that was the reality for him too, that he couldn’t deliver the party </p>
<p>without it.”</p>
<p>271</p>
<p><b>828. </b> Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair that he should tell President Bush that:</p>
<p>“Even our closest allies are clear about their own domestic political constraints.  </p>
<p>They would all much prefer a second resolution if at all possible. You have to have </p>
<p>one too …</p>
<p>“… a pattern of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation would not suffice for a French vote in favour of </p>
<p>a second resolution. Our assessment is that there are only four positive votes …</p>
<p>“So it follows that a WMD find or an Iraqi obstruction of the inspectors would </p>
<p>transform the international context. Short of that, we need a pattern of Blix reports on </p>
<p>Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation. This all points to a little more time – weeks not months – as </p>
<p>you argued in your Note, to improve the chances of securing a second resolution.”</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>829. </b> The conversation on 29 January was brief.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>830. </b> Mr Blair congratulated President Bush for setting out the case on Iraq in his State </p>
<p>of the Union address. He told President Bush that he [Mr Blair] was speaking to several </p>
<p>colleagues so that he would have a clear picture of their positions before their meeting. </p>
<p>Dr Blix’s January report had been much better than expected and had helped to change </p>
<p>some minds.</p>
<p><b>831. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush agreed to speak the following day on a secure line.</p>
<p><b>832. </b> In their telephone conversation on 30 January, Mr Blair and President Bush </p>

<p>153</p>
<p><b>833. </b> Repeating many of the points in his Note to President Bush of 24 January, </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft reported that Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… having consulted other leaders it was clear that the issue was not time for its </p>
<p>own sake but time to secure a second resolution. Leaving aside public opinion, </p>
<p>a second resolution would help protect us against any unexpected events during </p>
<p>a military campaign. Saddam had no intention of complying with 1441 so Bush </p>
<p>was right to ensure that this did not drag on. The Prime Minister thought that we </p>
<p>needed two more Blix reports, one every two weeks, to build up a pattern of Iraqi </p>
<p>non&#8209;co&#8209;operation. At that point, all other countries including France could possibly </p>
<p>come on side for a second resolution. But they would need a reason to change </p>
<p>their position, which Blix’s reports could provide. For instance, it would be difficult </p>
<p>for Putin to support a second resolution next week but he might do so in the future. </p>
<p>This could make it impossible for France to attract sufficient support. If they vetoed </p>
<p>alone, the French would be the unilateral ones.”</p>
<p><b>834. </b> Following a discussion of President Bush’s position, Mr Blair accepted that there </p>
<p>would be a need to “maintain a position of strength and exhibit increased confidence </p>
<p>in our case. Blix’s role would be important.”</p>
<p><b>835. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the need to push hard for peace in the </p>

<p><b>836.  Mr Blair suggested to Mr José Maria Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, </b></p>
<p><b>that a second resolution could be sought in late February, but not earlier.</b></p>
<p><b>837. </b> Mr Blair met Mr Aznar in Madrid on 30 January on his way to Washington.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The meeting was followed by a press conference.</p>
<p><b>838. </b> Mr Blair told Mr Aznar that he had told President Bush that a second resolution </p>
<p>was politically necessary for the UK. If the inspectors did not find any WMD, the “next </p>
<p>best outcome would be for Blix to establish through a second and third report to the </p>
<p>Security Council that Iraq was refusing full co&#8209;operation”. The UK should thereafter, </p>
<p>in early March, seek a second resolution when, “assuming strong Blix reports”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>judged Russia would not object and France would need to choose whether to veto. </p>
<p>Mr Blair also suggested allowing time after a second resolution for Arab countries </p>
<p>to try to force Saddam Hussein into exile.</p>
<p><b>839. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Aznar discussed the impact of a veto on the UN and, therefore, </p>
<p>the need to avoid one; and whether it would be better to seek a second resolution in </p>
<p>mid&#8209; rather than late February. Mr Blair argued that the situation could not be allowed </p>
<p>to “drag on, but it was important to give it a little longer”. He acknowledged that public </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>opinion was moving against military action but suggested it could be brought round. </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s preference was to wait until the end of February, including to allow further </p>
<p>reports from Dr Blix, which would highlight Iraq’s non&#8209;compliance, and give time to </p>
<p>work on Security Council members.</p>
<p><b>840. </b> Mr Blair thanked Mr Aznar for his role in the joint article and stated that he would </p>
<p>propose “a system of communications co&#8209;ordination” to President Bush.</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Asked what would happen if there was no second resolution, Mr Blair responded </p>
<p>that “he thought military action would follow anyway, but in far tougher political </p>
<p>circumstances”; and “The aftermath would be much easier to handle if the UN </p>
<p>had authorised military action and the subsequent rebuilding of Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>Papers produced for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush</b></p>
<p><b>842.  Mr Blair was sent a number of papers from across Whitehall before his </b></p>
<p><b>meeting with President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>843. </b> In preparation for the meeting with President Bush, Mr Rycroft sent Mr Blair a pack </p>
<p>of “background papers” on 30 January.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> He added that there would be “plenty of other </p>
<p>papers, including JIC papers to give you on the plane”.</p>
<p><b>844. </b> The papers on Iraq were produced by the FCO, the MOD and the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p><b>845. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, the Assistant Head of OD Sec (Foreign Policy), sent Mr Rycroft </p>
<p>a minute setting out a “few OD Sec points, just in case they slip through the briefing” </p>
<p>provided by the FCO and MOD.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to agree joint military campaign objectives for publication “shortly </p>
<p>before any conflict starts”; the UK should offer a draft;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an offer of “help on handling Iran”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “importance of transparency in the use of oil revenues”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for agreement on an “UNMOVIC/IAEA role in finding and destroying </p>
<p>WMD post Saddam”.</p>
<p>MOD LETTER, 29 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>846.  The MOD drew attention to the implications which any delay in military action </b></p>
<p><b>beyond the spring would have for its ability to provide a major contribution for </b></p>
<p><b>military action, and the need for the US and UK to have agreed military objectives.</b></p>
<p><b>847. </b> The MOD briefing of 29 January comprised a general update and sections on </p>

<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>848. </b> The MOD “line to take” suggested for Mr Blair was that, if military operations were </p>
<p>to be delayed beyond April/May, the UK would “struggle to put together this scale of </p>
<p>force again for the autumn, especially if the fire strike continues. So militarily we could </p>
<p>bear some delay but not too much.”</p>
<p><b>849. </b> The background briefing for Mr Blair advised that, if operations were not initiated </p>
<p>in the spring, the UK would “face some awkward choices”. Some “key elements of </p>
<p>the UK contribution were unique” – including the Commando Brigade, the Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade and a specialist helicopter carrier ship. The MOD suggested:</p>
<p>“If operations were not going to start until the autumn, we would need to consider </p>
<p>bringing some forces back to the UK in the meantime. Our ability to provide a </p>
<p>major contribution later in the year will also be severely constrained if the fire strike </p>
<p>continues beyond the spring.”</p>
<p><b>850. </b> The MOD also advised Mr Blair that agreement on the objectives for a military </p>
<p>campaign would be needed. The development of the UK’s objectives and the discussion </p>
<p>of the legal basis for the conduct of military operations are addressed in Section 6.2.</p>
<p><b>851. </b> In relation to targeting, the “line to take” offered to Mr Blair was that the UK was </p>
<p>“working up our strategic objectives for a military campaign. We need to relate this </p>
<p>to the legal base we establish.” It was “Very important that UK and US objectives are </p>
<p>aligned soon and in advance of commitment to action so that we can come to a clear </p>
<p>and common understanding on <b>targeting issues</b> and the <b>information campaign</b>.” </p>
<p>That would need “careful handling domestically”.</p>
<p><b>852. </b> The background briefing for Mr Blair explained that the current thinking was that </p>
<p>the objectives would be published “close to, or at the start of hostilities”. The MOD </p>
<p>explained that the military objectives would enable it to “satisfy” itself “that they </p>
<p>represent[ed] minimum use of force as required by international law”, and to use the </p>
<p>CDS Directive to indicate “what military missions are legitimate, including … what </p>
<p>targets we can legitimately attack from the air; and plan information operations”.</p>
<p><b>853. </b> A “publicly agreed set of aligned military objectives”, being prepared by the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office, would enable the UK to participate in a “joined up <b>information </b></p>
<p><b>operations campaign</b>”.</p>
<p>FCO ADVICE, 30 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>854.  The FCO focused on the need for more time in the hope of disarming </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq without military action and, if that was not possible, support for a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>855. </b> The briefing paper for Mr Blair prepared by the FCO Middle East Department </p>
<p>on 30 January described the objectives for the meeting as:</p>
<p>“to convince President Bush that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>our strategy, though working, needs more time;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the military campaign will be very shocking in many parts of the world, </p>
<p>especially in its opening phase (five times the bombing of the [1991] </p>
<p>Gulf War);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a second UN Security Council resolution (i) would greatly strengthen the </p>
<p>US’s position, (ii) is politically essential for the UK, and almost certainly </p>
<p>legally essential as well;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>we should support Saudi ideas for disarmament and regime change with </p>
<p>UN blessing;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US needs to pay much more attention, quickly, to planning on ‘day after’ </p>
<p>issues; and that the UN needs to be central to it.”</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>856. </b> The paper set out a number of key messages for Mr Blair to convey to </p>
<p>President Bush reflecting those objectives, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More time would not be “stringing things out: it is patience with a purpose”. </p>
<p>The disarmament of Iraqi WMD and the departure of Saddam Hussein could </p>
<p>be achieved “with wide international support”, but we were “not there yet”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were three strategic advantages in “letting time work for us”:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The military build&#8209;up was “already producing some signs of fracturing in the </p>
<p>regime. We will lose nothing by letting the pressure build. We might be able </p>
<p>to achieve our objectives without firing a shot.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Inspections were “beginning to produce results … The Iraqis are rattled. </p>
<p>They are showing signs of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation (U2s, interviews). Blix brought </p>
<p>this out very clearly in New York … shifting the terms of the debate against </p>
<p>Iraq. More time will increase the evidence of systematic failure by Saddam </p>
<p>to comply. Before long likely to produce compelling evidence of Iraqi </p>
<p>deceit …”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The mounting pressure was “finally galvanising moderate Arabs to work </p>
<p>with us to get Saddam out using the leverage of a second resolution. </p>
<p>We need to build up a plan on the basis of Prince Saud’s [Saudi Arabian </p>
<p>Foreign Minister] ideas covering who would have to go, and how we </p>
<p>would handle a transition to a new group of leaders who would meet Iraq’s </p>
<p>obligations under our supervision.”</p>

<p>157</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A second UN resolution would be the “Basis for this approach”. It would </p>
<p>“transform the politics in the UK, Europe and the wider world” and it “might even </p>
<p>produce an implosion in Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would “take an effort to get the nine positive votes needed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Moderate Arabs might support military action “when the time comes”, but they </p>
<p>would need “a second resolution and wider international support for force, as </p>
<p>well as being seen to give Saddam Hussein one last chance to climb down”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All the trends pointed to “a crunch time around end March”. The FCO did not </p>
<p>see how a second resolution could be obtained “in the next few weeks, absent </p>
<p>a dramatic new fact”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was with the US “100% on the goal; full disarmament by force and </p>
<p>regime change if necessary. But we have to contrive circumstances in which </p>
<p>we can carry a broad coalition and domestic opinion with us.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Working with the UN would “produce a huge prize” in relation to rebuilding </p>
<p>Iraq with international support “which allows us to exit”, sending a “powerful </p>
<p>message” to other “would be proliferators”, and that domestic opinion would </p>
<p>be “more convinced by the legal case”. That was “worth taking time over”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was merit in the Saudis’ idea for Arab League pressure on Saddam </p>
<p>to go and the idea of a “UN trusteeship” was “worth close examination”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An overall “winning concept” was needed which “should embrace both military </p>
<p>action and ‘day&#8209;after’ administration in Iraq”. It would be “pointless and </p>
<p>damaging to win war and lose peace”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “irresponsible to abandon Iraq quickly after toppling Saddam”. </p>
<p>The “risk of civil war would be real” and “Iraq’s neighbours would get dragged </p>
<p>in, creating instability in the whole region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition Forces would “not be seen as liberators for long, if at all. Our motives </p>
<p>are regarded with huge suspicion. The Iraqis … want us gone quickly. Our </p>
<p>occupation and administration of Iraq will become more unpopular and its </p>
<p>awfulness more debatable, the longer it continues.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Blunt fact” was “that in those circumstances any reforms are unlikely </p>
<p>to stick. Iraqis will need legitimate international presence holding the ring </p>
<p>while they themselves set up new, Iraqi, structures.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The period of “government by military coalition” should be kept “as short </p>
<p>as possible” and an “international administration with UN blessing” </p>
<p>introduced “quickly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Restoring the oil production would be “an immediate challenge”. The oil </p>
<p>sector would “need some technology and a lot of capital”. The US and UK </p>
<p>should “encourage an open investment regime and a level playing field for </p>
<p>foreign companies”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK media and Parliament had “not yet focused on day&#8209;after questions. </p>
<p>But it would be very difficult to sustain a UK contribution to day&#8209;after if our </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>occupation of Iraq were opposed, in Iraq and in region.” The UK did not “want </p>
<p>a repeat of the 1920s”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK agreed with the US “objective of a NATO role” but “there is very little </p>
<p>chance of getting a formal … decision at present”.</p>
<p><b>857. </b> A three&#8209;page Background Note and an Annex setting out the views of key </p>
<p>governments was also produced.</p>
<p><b>858. </b> On the legal position, the Background Note stated:</p>
<p>“There are concerns that a second resolution authorising the use of force is needed </p>
<p>before force may lawfully be employed against Iraq to enforce the WMD obligations </p>
<p>in the UNSCRs. If a draft resolution fails because of a veto (or indeed because it </p>
<p>does not receive nine positive votes), the fact that the veto is judged ‘unreasonable’ </p>
<p>is immaterial from a legal point of view.”</p>
<p><b>859. </b> In response to a request from Mr Blair, Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle </p>
<p>East and North Africa, provided additional briefing on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the humanitarian situation – described as “the one area where US Day After </p>
<p>planning is reasonably advanced”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>options for a second resolution – work was “in hand” and details were “in briefing </p>
<p>pack”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN involvement in the aftermath – that was “only likely to make progress if the </p>
<p>US side gets a signal from the President to take it seriously”.</p>

<p>LORD GOLDSMITH’S MINUTE, 30 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>860.  Lord Goldsmith wrote to Mr Blair on 30 January to emphasise that his view </b></p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S NOTE, 30 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>862.  A Note entitled ‘Countdown’ set out a checklist of issues for Mr Blair’s </b></p>

<p><b>a “smoking gun”.</b></p>
<p><b>864. </b> A document entitled ‘Countdown’ appears in the No.10 files for 30 January 2003.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>865. </b> The Note set out a potential timetable for action which anticipated two further </p>
<p>reports from Dr Blix, on 14 and 28 February and each “harder on non&#8209;co&#8209;operation”, </p>
<p>leading to a UN discussion and a resolution “authorising action; or at least declaring </p>
<p>Iraq in material breach” by 5 March. Saudi Arabia might then have “10 days to mobilise </p>
<p>Arab opinion to try to force Saddam out” before military action beginning on 15 March. </p>
<p>It would be “preferable” if the report on 28 February judged that there was “no sign of </p>
<p>Iraq fully co&#8209;operating” and that the inspectors could not “disarm unless there is full </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation”. The timetable could be:</p>
<p>“… shortened if either dramatic find by Blix or 14 February report sufficiently hard; </p>
<p>lengthened, but not beyond end March, if resolution takes more time.”</p>
<p><b>866. </b> The document comprised six sections with very short bullet points in each. </p>
<p>Those were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Military Questions”. Whether there were sound plans: in the event that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein used WMD, attacked Israel, or destroyed oil wells; to keep rival groups </p>
<p>and tribes apart; and to avoid civilian casualties.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Aftermath Questions”. What would happen immediately, “a new Iraqi </p>
<p>government or US run”? What type of Iraqi government would be the aim </p>
<p>in the medium term?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Blix”. Had been given “very good intelligence”. The Note suggested; “Close </p>
<p>working”, “Persuasion of doctrine of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation”; “Tie in with ElBaradei”; </p>
<p>and “To be seen by coalition leaders”, including Mr Blair and President Bush </p>
<p>before 14 February.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Related Issues”. A renewed push on Afghanistan; progress on the MEPP;  </p>
<p>“HIV/AIDS and Poverty”; “North Korea”; “US/EU relations”; and “Oil”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Diplomacy”. The approaches to be adopted with a number of UN Member </p>
<p>States and the Iraqi Opposition, including courting Russia and China and </p>
<p>bringing them fully on board and finding a “way down” for France.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Strategy”. The need for: a “Proper communications operation”; joint work on </p>
<p>planning; and “regular updates between principals, with clear and set agenda”.</p>

<p>President Bush’s support for a second resolution. Sir David Manning had reported that </p>
<p>the US “was really impatient with the UN” and advised Mr Blair that “we had to fight hard </p>
<p>for more time, that we should persuade them [the US] it was in their own interests”.</p>
<p><b>868. </b> Mr Blair was “clear in his own mind about policy and strategy, but worried </p>

<p>“… persuading the US that it was in America’s interests to stay with the UN … it </p>
<p>would be total madness not to … but it was not going to be easy. He was aiming </p>

<p><b>869. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had been “worried” after the telephone call with </p>

<p>wanted to take President Bush to one side to:</p>
<p>“… go through the whole thing. They [the US] may not like it, but Blix was the key … </p>
<p>They couldn’t just bully here. Blix had to get the evidence of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>and we had to get the argument round to non&#8209;co&#8209;operation being a breach, but </p>
<p>we needed two or three Blix reports to get that …”</p>
<p><b>870. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair was:</p>

<p>SIR JEREMY GREENSTOCK’S ADVICE, 31 JANUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>871.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that time would be needed to secure a </b></p>
<p><b>second resolution. Persuading France to change its position would be the key </b></p>
<p><b>to influencing others.</b></p>
<p><b>872.  A clearer understanding of the UK’s legal “bottom lines” was urgently </b></p>
<p><b>needed to inform thinking on a second resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>873.  A more consultative approach by the US would “work wonders”.</b></p>
<p><b>874. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised early on 31 January that Dr Blix’s report to </p>

<p>161</p>
<p>France’s “contention” that “Iraq’s co&#8209;operation was pretty good so far” did not “echo </p>
<p>in the Council”. But, at the same time, “all other Council members want to give the </p>
<p>inspections longer”.</p>
<p><b>875. </b> Sir Jeremy recommended that the UK’s approach to forthcoming discussions </p>
<p>of Iraq in the Security Council should be to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hammer home the message that further time would be “a cop&#8209;out”. It would </p>
<p>give “the Iraqis comfort” and mean that they did not need to “take the necessary </p>
<p>steps to comply”. Assuring Iraq that the Security Council was “determined and </p>
<p>willing to contemplate force” was the only solution to getting the Iraqis to “crack”. </p>
<p>Persuading France to change its position would be the key to influencing others.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Continue working as hard as possible to provide a “smoking gun” (or denial of </p>
<p>access) through UNMOVIC. That was “indispensible” and the UK should “fight </p>
<p>for time” for that. The planned presentation by Secretary Powell, to the Security </p>
<p>Council on 5 February, would need to be convincing: “A weak presentation will </p>

<p>Develop our thinking on a second resolution: “Most crucially and rapidly we </p>
<p>need a clearer understanding of our legal bottom lines.” The “most realistic way </p>
<p>forward may well be an ultimatum”. Further work would be needed “on how best </p>
<p>that might be constructed (e.g. making use of the UNMOVIC clusters)”.</p>
<p><b>876. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that he would need discretion on the best moment to float </p>
<p>a second resolution, but at that stage he did not envisage the issue coming to a </p>
<p>head before the second half of February. Securing a second resolution would, in his </p>
<p>view, take time. Secretary Powell’s address to the Security Council would be used </p>
<p>to encourage discussion.</p>
<p><b>877. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“Securing a second resolution is going to take time and some coaching of the </p>
<p>Security Council. Resolution 1441 took four times as long as we first imagined. </p>
<p>Our policy as we go into the meetings … [with President Bush] is therefore well </p>
<p>justified. A more nuanced and consultative approach by the US, even for a few </p>
<p>days, would also work wonders – focused more on why we need to deal with Iraqi </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance and less on the relentless drive to an inevitable war. Powell’s </p>
<p>decision to address the Security Council has to be used as discussion time, </p>
<p>not just a lecture.”</p>

<p><b>Iraq letter, 31 January 2003</b></p>
<p>In anticipation of Secretary Powell’s presentation of 5 February, Dr Sabri wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Annan on 31 January requesting the US Government to “submit immediately its </p>
<p>alleged evidence” to enable UNMOVIC and the IAEA to begin investigations and report </p>
<p>to the Security Council.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>Dr Sabri also stated that the 518 inspections since 27 November, which included all the </p>
<p>sites identified by the US and the UK, had shown that the allegations were “devoid of </p>
<p>truth and had been drafted in order to distort the picture of Iraq and create pretexts for </p>
<p>aggression against Iraq and against the region as a whole”.</p>
<p><b>878. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock went to see Mr Annan on 31 January to bring him </p>
<p>up to date with the UK’s thinking.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p><b>879. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had told Mr Annan that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “would be encouraging the US to give the process more time and would </p>
<p>also underline the importance of a second resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK wanted to hear Dr Blix’s report on 14 February and might want another </p>
<p>one after that.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He did not think there would be military action during February.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We were concerned to ensure enough time (even beyond that [late February]) </p>
<p>to make it as likely as possible we could secure a second resolution.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The only way to resolve this issue without force was for Saddam to crack and </p>
<p>preferably to leave (though we realised the latter seemed unlikely at present).”</p>
<p><b>880. </b> Sir Jeremy also asked whether what he had proposed “offended Annan’s bottom </p>
<p>line on the need to safeguard the international system”. Mr Annan had replied that </p>
<p>it did not.</p>
<p><b>881. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that, “going over the same questions again and again” </p>
<p>in Washington on 31 January before the meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… kept saying we needed a clear intellectual construct, which was that 1441 focus </p>
<p>should be on co&#8209;operation issues, if the Iraqis didn’t co&#8209;operate and Blix makes </p>
<p>that clear repeatedly, we should say so and then we go for a second resolution and </p>
<p>action could follow. We had allowed the goalposts to be moved to the smoking&#8209;gun </p>
<p>issue, and instead it had to be about the inspectors not getting co&#8209;operation.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush, 31 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>882.  When Mr Blair met President Bush on 31 January it was clear that the </b></p>
<p><b>window of opportunity before the US took military action would be very short. </b></p>
<p><b>The military campaign could begin “around 10 March”.</b></p>
<p><b>883.  President Bush agreed to support a second resolution to help Mr Blair. </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair confirmed that he was “solidly with the President and ready to do </b></p>
<p><b>whatever it took to disarm Saddam” Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>884.  The absence of discussion about planning for the post&#8209;conflict administration </b></p>
<p><b>and reconstruction of Iraq is addressed in Section 6.5.</b></p>
<p><b>885. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush had a two&#8209;hour meeting in Washington on 31 January </p>
<p>followed by a press conference and an informal dinner.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>886. </b> The meeting began with a presentation on the threat posed by Abu Musab </p>
<p>al&#8209;Zarqawi</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> and the Al Qaida poisons network by a US official. Sir Richard Dearlove </p>
<p>attended that part of the discussion.</p>
<p><b>887. </b> The remainder of the discussion focused on the issue of a second UN resolution </p>
<p>and the timetable of a military campaign.</p>
<p><b>888. </b> Following a discussion of whether a second resolution would help the UK and the </p>
<p>relationship between US planning for military action and the diplomatic strategy, Mr Blair </p>
<p>confirmed that he was:</p>
<p>“… solidly with the President and ready do whatever it took to disarm Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>889. </b> Mr Blair added that he firmly believed that it was essential to tackle the threats </p>
<p>posed by WMD and terrorism. He wanted a second resolution if we could possibly get </p>
<p>one because it would make it much easier politically to deal with Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>He believed that a second resolution was in reach. A second resolution was an </p>
<p>insurance policy against the unexpected.</p>
<p><b>890. </b> Mr Blair set out his position that the key argument in support of a second </p>
<p>resolution must rest on the requirement in 1441 that Saddam Hussein must co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>with the inspectors. Dr Blix had already said on 27 January that this was not happening; </p>
<p>he needed to repeat that message when he reported to the Security Council in </p>
<p>mid&#8209;February and at the end of February/early March. That would help to build the case </p>
<p>for a second resolution.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>891. </b> Mr Blair added that there were various uncertainties:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein might claim at the eleventh hour to have had a change </p>
<p>of heart.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We could not be sure that Dr Blix’s second and third reports would be as helpful </p>
<p>as his first.</p>
<p><b>892. </b> Mr Blair was, therefore, flexible about the timing of the second resolution. If we </p>
<p>could get it quickly, “well and good”. But the key was to ensure that we secured it. </p>
<p>We had taken the UN route in the expectation that the UN would deal with the Iraq </p>
<p>problem, not provide an alibi for avoiding the tough decisions. Resolution 1441 was </p>
<p>clear that this was Saddam Hussein’s final opportunity. We had been very patient. </p>
<p>Now we should be saying that the crisis must be resolved in weeks, not months. </p>
<p>The international community had to confront the challenges of WMD and terrorism now.</p>
<p><b>893. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that the second resolution:</p>
<p>“… was not code for delay or hesitation. It was a clear statement that Saddam </p>
<p>was not co&#8209;operating and that the international community was determined to do </p>
<p>whatever it took to disarm him. We needed to put the debate in a wider context. </p>
<p>The international community had to confront the challenges of WMD and terrorism </p>
<p>now, whether in Iraq or North Korea, otherwise the risks would only increase.”</p>
<p><b>894. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair discussed Dr ElBaradei’s analysis on the aluminium </p>
<p>tubes procured by Iraq. They also discussed the uncertainties and risks arising from </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s potential actions.</p>
<p><b>895. </b> On military planning, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the possibility that </p>
<p>Iraqi forces would fold quickly. Mr Blair asked about planning for the aftermath. In his </p>
<p>view a UN badge would be needed. That would help with the humanitarian problems. </p>
<p>Mr Blair and President Bush discussed an initial military occupation, how to manage </p>
<p>the dilemma of managing the transition to civil administration and the nature of an </p>
<p>Iraqi government.</p>
<p><b>896. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the US and UK needed to prepare to organise on a “war </p>
<p>footing” working very closely together “particularly on our public communications”.</p>
<p><b>897. </b> Sir David Manning recorded that it was clear that the window of opportunity would </p>
<p>be only a few weeks. Otherwise the US would take military action. The military campaign </p>
<p>could begin “around 10 March”, and earlier if Dr Blix’s report on 14 February was tough. </p>
<p>The timing was “very tight”.</p>
<p><b>898. </b> The UK should do all it could to help the inspectors make a significant find and </p>
<p>work hard on the other members of the Security Council to accept the “non&#8209;co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>case” to “secure the minimum nine votes when we need them, probably by the end </p>
<p>of February”.</p>

<p><b>899. </b> The FCO Iraq policy meeting on 3 February was informed that feedback from the </p>
<p>31 January meeting indicated that Mr Blair had “persuaded President Bush to allow time </p>
<p>for a serious effort to secure a second resolution”; and that Mr Ricketts would discuss </p>
<p>options and tactics with Mr Straw.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>900. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Sir David Manning’s record of the meeting </p>
<p>with President Bush:</p>
<p>“… made pretty clear they [the US] had made their minds up and that the campaign </p>
<p>was going to start … For Bush the diplomacy had to be based round the military </p>
<p>campaign, not the other way round. We had very short timelines now.”</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><b>901. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair had told him that the meeting with President Bush </p>
<p>had been “the best … they had in terms of substance”. President Bush “had read and </p>
<p>digested” Mr Blair’s Notes and “was more on the same page than we thought, said he </p>
<p>intended to work hard for a second resolution and work to get a majority for it”.</p>
<p><b>902. </b> Addressing Mr Blair’s success in getting President Bush to support a second </p>
<p>resolution on 31 January, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote in his statement for the Inquiry </p>
<p>that it had not been easy to get US agreement “because of the spread of views in </p>
<p>Washington and because we had already used up much of our ammunition with </p>
<p>Washington on the utility of the UN route in securing [resolution] 1441”.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>903. </b> Sir Jeremy added: “It was noticeable … that President Bush’s words on this subject </p>
<p>in public were rather less warm and specific than those he had used with the Prime </p>
<p>Minister in private.”</p>
<p><b>904. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry that President Bush had told Mr Blair: “We, ourselves, </p>
<p>don’t particularly need a second resolution, but we realise that you do.”</p>
<p>293</p>
<p><b>905. </b> The record of the meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush on 31 January </p>
<p>confirms these elements of Mr Campbell’s and Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s accounts.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>906. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that Mr Blair was “confident of getting a second </p>
<p>resolution”; and he was:</p>
<p>“… adamant that it was the right thing to do to get rid of Saddam and send out the </p>
<p>message that we were determined to deal with WMD. But he knew how tough it </p>
<p>was going to be. Expressing confidence in a second resolution was the best way </p>
<p>of dealing with that.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>907. </b> Mr Blair had “felt things had gone about as well as they could have done, but still </p>
<p>felt they [the US] were doing the right thing in the wrong way, and just wished they could </p>
<p>improve the way they put their case to the world”.</p>
<p><b>908.  In their press conference President Bush and Mr Blair stated clearly that time </b></p>
<p><b>was running out for Saddam Hussein to disarm peacefully; but neither stated a </b></p>
<p><b>commitment to securing a second resolution. That left their position ambiguous.</b></p>
<p><b>909. </b> In the press conference following the meeting President Bush expressed his </p>
<p>appreciation for Mr Blair’s “vision”, his “willingness to lead” and: “Most importantly … </p>
<p>his understanding that after September 11th, 2001, the world changed: that we face </p>
<p>a common enemy.”</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> President Bush also stated that he trusted Mr Blair’s judgement </p>
<p>and appreciated his wisdom.</p>
<p><b>910. </b> Mr Blair stated that it was essential to mobilise international support and the </p>
<p>international community to deal with the linked threats of international terrorism and </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction. That was “essential for the future peace and security </p>
<p>and prosperity of the world”.</p>
<p><b>911. </b> In the questions that followed, President Bush said twice that the timing of </p>
<p>a decision on Iraq would be “weeks, not months” and that was also Mr Blair’s view. </p>
<p>He added that the US would resist “any attempt to drag the process on for months”. </p>
<p>He had gone to the United Nations asking it to show that it had “the capacity to keep the </p>
<p>peace”. If the UN decided to pass a second resolution “it would be welcomed” if it was </p>
<p>“yet another signal that we’re intent upon disarming Saddam Hussein”: “But 1441 gives </p>
<p>us the authority to move without any second resolution.” Secretary Powell’s presentation </p>
<p>to the UN would “make it clear” that Saddam was “fooling the world, or trying to fool the </p>
<p>world”. He subsequently added: “Saddam Hussein would like nothing more than to use </p>
<p>a terrorist network to attack and kill …”</p>
<p><b>912. </b> Mr Blair did not answer a question asking if he had asked President Bush to secure </p>
<p>a second resolution. He stated that the judgement had to be that Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“not co&#8209;operating with the inspectors, and therefore is in breach of the UN resolution”. </p>
<p>That was why time was “running out”.</p>
<p><b>913. </b> Asked if there was a link between Saddam Hussein and those who had attacked </p>
<p>the US on 11 September 2001, President Bush replied: “I can’t make that claim.”</p>
<p><b>914. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair both emphasised that Saddam Hussein had played </p>
<p>games for 12 years, and that he was still playing games. He had to co&#8209;operate with the </p>
<p>inspectors and demonstrate he was disarming. If not, he would be disarmed by force.</p>

<p>167</p>
<p><b>915. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that he had wanted to get President Bush “as close as possible </p>
<p>to a second resolution” and to “tone down the rush&#8209;to&#8209;war talk”.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>916. </b> Mr Campbell added that there had been debate about what to say about a second </p>
<p>resolution. The White House Press Secretary had been opposed to the idea that </p>
<p>President Bush should say he was “open” to a second resolution because “that would be </p>
<p>seen as a shift in US policy”. President Bush had been impatient and the messages had </p>
<p>not been “properly prepared”.</p>
<p><b>917. </b> In Mr Campbell’s view:</p>
<p>“The overall impression was poor. TB didn’t really answer the question about </p>
<p>the second resolution. And though Bush said it would be ‘welcome’ he looked </p>
<p>uncomfortable and the body language was poor … Even though the words were </p>
<p>kind of OK, the overall impression was not.”</p>
<p><b>918. </b> Mr Campbell’s decision to give journalists travelling to Washington with Mr Blair </p>
<p>a report, ‘Iraq – its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’,</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>the content of the report which became the subject of considerable controversy, is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>919.  Accounts published by President Bush and Vice President Cheney </b></p>
<p><b>demonstrate that there were serious reservations about pursuing a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution and whether it was achievable.</b></p>
<p><b>920. </b> In his memoir President Bush wrote that Mr Blair had gone to Washington “for a </p>
<p>strategy session”. They had “agreed” that Saddam Hussein had “violated” resolution </p>
<p>1441 “by submitting a false declaration”; and that they “had ample justification to enforce </p>
<p>the ‘serious consequences’”.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>921. </b> President Bush added that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… wanted to go back to the UN for a second resolution clarifying that Iraq had </p>
<p>‘failed to take the final opportunity afforded to it’.</p>
<p>“‘It’s not that we need it’ Tony said. ‘A second resolution gives military and </p>
<p>political protection.’”</p>
<p><b>922. </b> President Bush wrote that he “dreaded the thought of plunging back into the UN” </p>
<p>and that Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld and Dr Rice “were opposed”. </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had told him that “we didn’t need another resolution and probably </p>
<p>couldn’t get one”. President Bush added that if Mr Blair “wanted a second resolution, </p>

<p>how best to help our friends.”</p>
<p><b>923. </b> Vice President Cheney wrote that Mr Blair had “returned to Washington at the end </p>
<p>of January” to argue that “we needed yet another resolution”; and that he, Secretary </p>
<p>Powell, Mr Rumsfeld and Dr Rice:</p>
<p>“… were all in agreement that this was a mistake. We’d managed one resolution, </p>
<p>no one believed we needed a second, and it would be very hard to get …</p>
<p>“I also thought that going to the UN again would make us look hesitant and uncertain, </p>
<p>but Blair saw a second resolution as a political necessity for him at home …</p>
<p>“Britain was our major ally and when the President decided to try for a second </p>
<p>resolution, I understood his reasons.”</p>
<p>299</p>
<p><b>924.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the main objective of his meeting with President </b></p>
<p><b>Bush on 31 January had been to secure US agreement to a second resolution for </b></p>
<p><b>political reasons.</b></p>
<p><b>925. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the main objective of the meeting on 31 January was </p>
<p>to convince President Bush that it was necessary to get a second resolution.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>“was obviously going to make life a lot easier politically in every respect”. Mr Blair added: </p>
<p>“we took the view that that was not necessary, but, obviously, politically, it would have </p>
<p>been far easier”. The American concern was that “they’d get pulled into a UN process, </p>
<p>you’d never get to a proper decision and then you’d never get the closure of the issue </p>
<p>in the way that you should”.</p>
<p><b>926. </b> Asked about President Bush’s view of the need for a second resolution, Mr Blair </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“President Bush’s view, and the view of the entire American system was that, </p>
<p>by that time, Saddam had been given the opportunity to comply …</p>
<p>“… he hadn’t taken it. Indeed, what we now know is that he was continuing to act </p>
<p>in breach of the UN resolutions even after the inspectors got back in there.</p>
<p>“So … the American view throughout had been … ‘This leopard isn’t going to change </p>
<p>his spots. He is always going to be difficult.’ So … their concern … that they’d get </p>
<p>pulled into a UN process, you’d never get to a proper decision and then you’d never </p>
<p>get the closure of the issue in a way that you should.</p>
<p>“The problem … from our perspective, was that … we wanted to carry on going </p>

<p>took the same view of the Iraqi behaviour up to … the end of January – that they </p>
<p>weren’t complying.”</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>927. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether a 2006 report in the <i>New York Times,</i> that President </p>
<p>Bush had said at the meeting that the Americans would put the work behind the effort </p>
<p>but, if it ultimately failed, military action would follow anyway, was correct, Mr Blair </p>
<p>responded:</p>
<p>“The President’s view was that if you can’t get a second resolution because, in </p>
<p>essence France and Russia are going to say no, even though … I don’t think they </p>
<p>were really disputing that Iraq was in breach of resolution 1441, then we were going </p>
<p>to be faced with a choice I never wanted to be faced with: did you go without a </p>
<p>second resolution?”</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>928. </b> Asked if his position had been that he would take military action with the US if a </p>
<p>second resolution could not be agreed, Mr Blair replied that “all sorts of factors would </p>
<p>be in play”, including the legal question and whether there would be political support. </p>
<p>But, in the context of an Iraqi breach, Mr Blair was:</p>
<p>“… under absolutely no doubt … that, if you backed away, when he was playing </p>
<p>around with the inspectors in precisely the way he had done before, then you were </p>
<p>going to send a very, very bad signal.”</p>

<p>discussed at that meeting was 10 March, Mr Blair replied: “It was at that meeting </p>
<p>or around about that time, certainly, yes.”</p>

<p><b>930. </b> In his memoir Mr Blair wrote that with the New Year there was a sense of being </p>

<p>“… had been silent on the need for a further resolution prior to any military action. </p>
<p>There were legal debates as to whether it was necessary, and Peter Goldsmith was </p>
<p>again anxious about it. The Russians had become negative, and it was perfectly </p>
<p>possible that a second resolution might be vetoed.</p>
<p>“I was still thinking it might be possible to get a second resolution – George </p>

<p>a threat, he would never co&#8209;operate fully with the international community, and the </p>
<p>world, not to say Iraq would be better off with him out of power. My instinct was with </p>
<p>them. Our alliance was with them. I had made a commitment after September 11 to </p>
<p>be ‘shoulder&#8209;to&#8209;shoulder’. I was determined to fulfil it.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, my isolation within Cabinet, let alone the PLP and large parts </p>
<p>of the media and public opinion, was colossal. And worrying, not because I might </p>
<p>go down … but because so much was at stake. War and peace. The struggle </p>
<p>against terrorism. The future of our treasured alliance. The reputation of the country </p>
<p>and its armed forces. Above all, people’s lives. Either way people’s lives, since </p>
<p>‘peace’ would not be peace for those in Iraq under the boot of Saddam.”</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>931. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“The political debate then crystallised in late 2002/early 2003 around calls for </p>
<p>a second resolution.</p>
<p>“We discussed this at various Cabinet meetings, the first of which was from my </p>
<p>recollection, that of 16 January 2003. It was then debated again at 30 January, </p>
<p>6 February, 13 February, 27 February and 6 March Cabinet meetings. In addition, </p>
<p>of course, it was informally hotly debated everywhere. In this instance there was </p>
<p>no disagreement: everyone thought it was politically beneficial.”</p>
<p><b>932. </b> Mr Blair also wrote:</p>
<p>“There was no doubt this was the easiest thing politically, both domestically for the </p>
<p>Government and internationally, to build the broader coalition. So in January 2003 </p>
<p>we began discreetly to canvass support. When asked, we said we were open to </p>
<p>one but did not need one. I also knew that Robin Cook was likely to resign in the </p>
<p>absence of one.</p>
<p>“We certainly believed at the outset that if we could push the US to go for it, we had </p>
<p>a real chance of getting it, though it would be very difficult. Germany’s leader had </p>
<p>apparently told President Bush that it would not support but it would not oppose. </p>
<p>There were reasonable discussions with France, though by early February, France </p>
<p>had hardened again. The US were working hard on the Russians.”</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>933. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“We knew we would not ever get a resolution explicitly authorising force. But we </p>
<p>thought it possible that the resolution might state what we all knew to be the case: </p>
<p>that Saddam was not fully and unconditionally co&#8209;operating. The Blix reports were </p>
<p>clear that any co&#8209;operation fell short. In particular, Blix lacked the ability to conduct </p>
<p>interviews without restrictions, a key issue for the inspections. So a ‘final’ final </p>
<p>ultimatum resolution might be agreed.”</p>

<p><b>935. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“It was clear from continuing discussion with the US in late 2002/early 2003 that </p>
<p>March was the likely date for military action. That firmed up as it became plain </p>
<p>that there was no significant shift in the attitude of Saddam. The December </p>
<p>declaration … was incomplete, as Blix noted … His first report was to the effect that </p>
<p>there was not full compliance, essentially around interviews. There were various </p>
<p>possible alternatives to military action surfacing, including proposals for Saddam </p>
<p>peacefully to give up power.”</p>
<p>308</p>
<p><b>936. </b> In the context of questions about his decision not to tell President Bush privately </p>
<p>that he was at that stage being advised by Lord Goldsmith that a second resolution </p>
<p>would be needed to provide the legal basis for UK participation in military action, Mr Blair </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that President Bush knew perfectly well that the UK needed a second </p>
<p>resolution. He added:</p>
<p>“If I had started raising legal issues at that point with the President, I think it would </p>
<p>have started to make him concerned as to whether we were really going to be there </p>
<p>or not and what was really going to happen. Now I would have done that because </p>
<p>in the end whatever I thought about the legal position, the person whose thoughts </p>

<p>310</p>
<p><b>939. </b> Asked whether the military timetable was so fixed that time was running out, </p>
<p>Sir David replied that the build up of troops meant there was “a sort of pressure to </p>

<p>“There’s also the American political timetable ticking. Bush wants this well out of the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>The views of Mr Blair and Sir Jeremy Greenstock</b></p>
<p><b>940.  The evidence set out in this Section demonstrates that, by the end of </b></p>
<p><b>January, Mr Blair had taken a public position that Iraq was failing fully to comply </b></p>
<p><b>with resolution 1441, and that this was a further material breach.</b></p>
<p><b>941. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… was deliberately concealing documentation, and … he was deliberately </p>
<p>not allowing people to be interviewed properly.</p>
<p>“In December 2002 … we received information, and this information remains valid, </p>
<p>that Saddam called together his key people and said that anybody who agreed </p>
<p>to an interview outside of Iraq was to be treated as a spy.”</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>942. </b> Mr Blair suggested that Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… retained full intent to restart his programme, and, therefore, it was very </p>
<p>important for him that interviews did not take place, because the interviews with </p>
<p>senior regime members were precisely what would have indicated the concealment </p>
<p>and the intent.”</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>943. </b> Asked whether there was a risk that, in putting down the second resolution the </p>
<p>UK would appear to be trying to curtail the inspection process because of the demands </p>
<p>of the military planning, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“It was more … the other way round, that what we were trying to do was to say: ‘how </p>
<p>do you resolve what, on any basis, is a somewhat indistinct picture being painted by </p>
<p>Dr Blix?’”</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>944. </b> In his memoir Mr Blair quoted at length from Dr Blix’s report of 27 January, which </p>
<p>he described as providing “essential context to understanding the decisions being taken </p>
<p>by me and others”.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p><b>945. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the report was:</p>
<p>“… critical to understand the context in which WMD were being debated in the </p>
<p>run&#8209;up to the outbreak of conflict. We the key allies had no doubt that Saddam </p>
<p>had an active WMD programme …</p>
<p>“There could be no doubt that the only reason for the inspectors being allowed back </p>
<p>into Iraq was a threat of military action. The build&#8209;up of American forces was likewise </p>
<p>the only conceivable reason for what co&#8209;operation there was. But the co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>fell short of what resolution 1441 demanded. And the history of dealing with Saddam </p>
<p>did not exactly lead to belief in his fidelity to the UN.”</p>

<p>3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>946. </b> Mr Blair wrote that he still “pinned some considerable hope on getting a diplomatic </p>
<p>breakthrough”; and that the prospect of a second resolution “was central”. But it was </p>
<p>apparent that “the law and politics were inextricably intertwined”. Above all, a second </p>
<p>resolution “would reunite the international community”.</p>
<p><b>947. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“So I thought inspections necessary but I knew they would only be successful with </p>
<p>genuine co&#8209;operation. The key to successful inspections was the ability to interview </p>
<p>and analyse the work of the technical experts. The JIC reports of 11 October 2002 </p>
<p>and then following the December 2002 declaration, of 18 December 2002 gave me </p>
<p>no grounds for believing inspections would be properly complied with.”</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>948. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi declaration … and the Blix reports to the UNSC were as unsatisfactory as </p>
<p>we anticipated. It was clear Saddam was not fully complying, i.e. he was in breach of </p>
<p>[resolution] 1441, but as the prospect of military action advanced, so he was inclined </p>
<p>to co&#8209;operate more. This is what JIC papers had said he would do.”</p>
<p><b>949. </b> Mr Blair also wrote that the declaration was “incomplete” and “That itself was </p>
<p>a breach of [resolution] 1441.”</p>
<p>317</p>
<p><b>950. </b> Asked if he had concluded quite early after the declaration that there was no </p>
<p>prospect of Saddam Hussein complying with the requirements of resolution 1441, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s basically correct …The intelligence reports were that he didn’t intend </p>
<p>to co&#8209;operate, that the declaration wasn’t correct, but there was also a very </p>
<p>significant piece of intelligence at that time, which was … that Saddam had said that </p>
<p>anybody who co&#8209;operated with overseas interviews would be treated as a spy, in </p>
<p>other words executed.”</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>951. </b> Mr Blair explained that “some in the American system” had “tried to claim” that the </p>
<p>declaration was a material breach, but the advice he received and his attitude was that </p>
<p>action could not be taken at that stage.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>952. </b> Asked whether he had expected in December 2002 and January 2003 that Dr Blix </p>
<p>would report that Saddam Hussein was not co&#8209;operating with the inspectors, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that, “given the history”, they had been looking for “very early and significant </p>
<p>signs that Saddam had genuinely changed the position of his regime”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>953. </b> Asked if the US military timetable would leave enough time to see whether </p>
<p>UNMOVIC could do its job, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… the timeline was pressing … because the Americans took the view it was absurd </p>
<p>to think that Saddam was going to change his mind, because he wasn’t …”</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>954.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock suggested that the primary reason for the second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution was as a means to persuade Saddam Hussein to disarm peacefully, </b></p>
<p><b>although it would also have helped to provide a legal basis for action if required.</b></p>
<p><b>955. </b> Asked about the UK’s objectives for the second resolution, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think we had two objectives and I have thought quite carefully about this, </p>
<p>because those objectives became confused in the heat of battle and in subsequent </p>
<p>interpretation with hindsight of what happened.</p>
<p>“… the two fundamental points were, first, that we had to try and create international </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq to give up WMD without a fight, and it was only possible to do that, </p>
<p>as far as I was concerned, through the United Nations, by having a very firm body </p>
<p>of international opinion that was against Iraq and determined to bring to a halt its </p>
<p>12&#8209;year contravention of UN resolutions. That was a primary purpose behind what </p>
<p>I was trying to design as a further resolution.</p>
<p>“Second, we were also concerned to establish the safest possible legal grounds for </p>
<p>the use of force if that should be necessary. We felt that we had legal grounds in </p>
<p>1441, but those grounds were contested. They were a matter of subjective opinion. </p>
<p>If one had a further resolution, establishing that there had been a material breach </p>
<p>since we had given Iraq the final opportunity, this would be unequivocal, and that </p>
<p>would be the safest possible legal grounds for the next steps, whatever they were.”</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>956.  In December 2002, President Bush said that the Iraqi declaration of </b></p>
<p><b>7 December 2002 demonstrated Saddam Hussein had had “no change of heart”.</b></p>
<p><b>957.  By early January 2003, Mr Blair had concluded that the military action was </b></p>
<p><b>the more likely outcome and, if conflict could not be avoided, that the UK should </b></p>
<p><b>support the US.</b></p>
<p><b>958.  The Inquiry has already concluded in Section 3.5 that Mr Blair and Mr Straw </b></p>
<p><b>envisaged that in the event of a material breach of Iraq’s obligations, a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution determining that a breach existed and authorising the use of force was </b></p>
<p><b>likely to be tabled in the Security Council.</b></p>

<p><b>959.  Lord Goldsmith was not invited to provide draft advice on the legal effect of </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441 until mid&#8209;January and, at that stage, it was given only to Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>960.  Lord Goldsmith’s position that a further decision by the Security </b></p>

<p><b>in resolution 678 (1990), although that decision need not be in the form of a </b></p>
<p><b>further resolution; and that there was no “room for arguing that a condition of </b></p>
<p><b>reasonableness [could] be implied as a precondition for the exercise of a veto”, </b></p>
<p><b>is addressed in Section 5.</b></p>
<p><b>961.  That remained Lord Goldsmith’s view throughout the events addressed in </b></p>
<p><b>this Section of the report.</b></p>
<p><b>962.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw repeatedly stated, however, that military action would </b></p>
<p><b>be justified if the Security Council failed, in the face of a report of a further </b></p>
<p><b>material breach, to “face up to its responsibilities”.</b></p>
<p><b>963.  In public statements Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued to declare that reports </b></p>
<p><b>from the inspectors would be the basis for seeking a second resolution which </b></p>
<p><b>was regarded as an essential prerequisite for securing both UK domestic and </b></p>
<p><b>international support for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>964.  In January 2003, there was a clear divergence between the UK and US </b></p>
<p><b>Government positions over the timetable for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>965.  The decisions to deploy military forces to the Gulf and the absence </b></p>
<p><b>of collective discussion of the implications are addressed in Sections 6 and 7.</b></p>
<p><b>966.  On 24 January, Mr Blair sent President Bush a proposal suggesting the </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors should be given until the end of March or early April to carry out their </b></p>
<p><b>task and asking for fortnightly reports to the Security Council on the extent of </b></p>
<p><b>Iraqi compliance.</b></p>
<p><b>967.  Mr Blair considered that, if those reports established a pattern of </b></p>
<p><b>non&#8209;compliance, they would, in the absence of other evidence that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>concealed WMD (a “smoking gun”), be sufficient to secure Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>support for a second resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>968.  The US and UK should seek to persuade others, including Dr Blix, that that </b></p>
<p><b>was the “true view” of resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>969.  By the end of January, Mr Blair had taken a public position that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>was failing fully to comply with resolution 1441, and that that was a further </b></p>
<p><b>material breach.</b></p>
<p><b>970.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw saw the meeting with President Bush on 31 January </b></p>
<p><b>as the best opportunity to gain US support for an approach designed to secure </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>971.  The Inquiry recognises that events were moving fast and that Mr Blair was </b></p>
<p><b>seeking to influence President Bush’s position.</b></p>
<p><b>972.  President Bush agreed to seek a second resolution to help Mr Blair, but </b></p>
<p><b>there were major reservations within the US Administration about the wisdom </b></p>
<p><b>of that approach.</b></p>
<p><b>973.  Mr Blair confirmed that he was “solidly with the President and ready </b></p>
<p><b>to do whatever it took” to disarm Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>974.  But President Bush was not prepared to agree a timetable which would </b></p>
<p><b>preclude US military action in early March.</b></p>
<p><b>975.  Mr Blair’s proposed approach to the discussion with President Bush was </b></p>
<p><b>discussed in a meeting of Ministers before Cabinet on 30 January and then </b></p>
<p><b>discussed in general terms in Cabinet itself. But no detailed and in depth analysis </b></p>
<p><b>of the strategy and its advantages and disadvantages, including the likelihood </b></p>
<p><b>of success, was prepared or discussed collectively by either senior officials </b></p>
<p><b>or Ministers. Nor were alternative options, which might have been available </b></p>
<p><b>to the UK at that stage, identified and considered.</b></p>
<p><b>976.  A review of the strategy would inevitably have focused on the tension </b></p>
<p><b>between the military timetable of the United States and the UK view that the </b></p>
<p><b>inspections needed more time before it would be possible to secure international </b></p>
<p><b>support and a further UN Security Council resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>977.  In the event, the approach failed to secure majority support in the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council in mid&#8209;March for a resolution stating that Iraq had failed to take the final </b></p>
<p><b>opportunity offered by resolution 1441; that the inspections had run their course; </b></p>
<p><b>and that military action was necessary as a last resort to disarm Saddam Hussein </b></p>
