<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the evolution of the assessment of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) </p>
<p>capabilities before Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Crawford in early </p>
<p>April 2002; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how the information was used within Government and in public, including the </p>
<p>preparation between February and July 2002 of a document for publication, </p>
<p>initially on WMD programmes of concern in four countries and subsequently </p>
<p>on Iraq. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> The development of UK strategy on Iraq before the attacks on the US in September </p>
<p>2001 is addressed in Section 1.2; the development of UK strategy and options after 9/11 </p>
<p>is addressed in Section 3.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The development of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessments of Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD programmes from late July onwards, and the resumption of work on the dossier </p>
<p>after Mr Blair’s press conference in Sedgefield on 3 September, are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 4.2.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and biological </p>
<p>warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its </p>
<p>capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was </p>
<p>pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment, had underpinned UK policy </p>
<p>towards Iraq since the Gulf Conflict ended in 1991. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a threat </p>
<p>to international peace and security in the Middle East, but overall, the threat from </p>
<p>Iraq was viewed as less serious than that from other key countries of concern – Iran, </p>
<p>Libya and North Korea. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Assessments issued by the JIC reflected the uncertainties within the intelligence </p>
<p>community about the detail of Iraq’s activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public from late </p>
<p>2001 onwards, conveyed more certainty than the JIC Assessments about Iraq’s </p>
<p>proscribed activities and the potential threat they posed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The tendency to refer in public statements only to Iraq’s “weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction” was likely to have created the impression that Iraq posed a greater threat </p>
<p>than the detailed JIC Assessments would have supported. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was nothing in the JIC Assessments issued before July 2002 that would </p>
<p>have raised any questions in policy-makers’ minds about the core construct of </p>
<p>Iraq’s capabilities and intent. Indeed, from May 2001 onwards, the perception </p>
<p>conveyed was that Iraqi activity could have increased since the departure of the </p>
<p>weapons inspectors, funded by Iraq’s growing illicit income from circumventing the </p>
<p>sanctions regime.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the light of sensitivities about their content and significance, publication of </p>
<p>documents on ‘Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction’, ‘Weapons Inspections’ and </p>
<p>‘Abuse of Human Rights’ was postponed until the policy on Iraq was clearer.</p>
<p><b>The UK’s assessment of Iraq’s WMD capabilities pre-9/11</b></p>
<p><b>The legacy of the 1990s</b></p>
<p><b>4.  The conviction that Iraq had retained elements of its prohibited nuclear, </b></p>
<p><b>chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes was the fundamental tenet </b></p>
<p><b>of UK policy towards Iraq throughout the 1990s. </b></p>
<p><b>5. </b> When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1991, Iraq had deployable stocks </p>
<p>of chemical and biological weapons, was developing long-range missiles and had an </p>
<p>active nuclear programme. </p>
<p><b>6. </b> Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons during the 1980s, in breach of </p>
<p>international law, both against the Kurds and during the war with Iran. He did not, </p>
<p>however, use them during the 1991 Gulf Conflict. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> After the 1991 Conflict, the UN Security Council sought to contain Iraq’s military </p>
<p>capability and restore international peace and security. On 3 April 1991, the UN </p>
<p>Security Council adopted resolution 687 imposing a wide range of obligations on Iraq. </p>
<p>The obligations in relation to “weapons of mass destruction” are summarised in the </p>
<p>Box below.</p>
<p><b>Resolution 687 (1991): Iraq’s WMD obligations</b></p>
<p>Section C of resolution 687 invited Iraq (operative paragraph (OP) 7) to reaffirm </p>
<p>unconditionally its obligations under the 1925 Geneva Protocol and to ratify the Biological </p>
<p>and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC).</p>
<p>The Security Council decided (OP8) that “Iraq shall unconditionally accept the destruction, </p>
<p>removal or rendering harmless, under international supervision”, of all:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“chemical and biological weapons”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“stocks of agents”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“related sub-systems and components”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“research, development, support and manufacturing facilities”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ballistic missiles with a range greater than one hundred and fifty kilometres”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“related major parts”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“repair and production facilities”.</p>
<p>Iraq was required (OP9) to submit, within 15 days, “a declaration of the locations, amounts </p>
<p>and types of all items” specified in OP8, and agree to urgent on-site inspection.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The Council decided (OP10) that “Iraq shall unconditionally undertake not to use, develop, </p>
<p>construct or acquire any of the items specified” in OPs 8 and 9.</p>
<p>Iraq was invited (OP11) “to reaffirm unconditionally its obligations under the Treaty on the </p>
<p>Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968”.</p>
<p>The Council decided (OP12) that “Iraq shall unconditionally agree not to acquire or </p>
<p>develop nuclear weapons or nuclear-weapons-useable material, or any sub-systems or </p>
<p>components or any research, development, support or manufacturing facilities related to” </p>
<p>nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The resolution also made provision for on-site inspection, destruction and removal of </p>
<p>prohibited material and future monitoring and verification. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> Containment of the threat from Iraq, and in particular its WMD capability, was a </p>
<p>continuing foreign policy concern throughout the 1990s and frequently required active </p>
<p>consideration of difficult and controversial issues, including significant military action. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The difficulties encountered by UN inspectors in pursuing the remit in resolution 687 </p>
<p>and subsequent UN resolutions, and the decision in December 1998 to withdraw UN </p>
<p>inspectors and to launch US and UK military action against Iraqi facilities, Operation </p>
<p>Desert Fox, are addressed in Section 1.1.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> In his statement to Parliament following Operation Desert Fox, Mr Blair said that the </p>
<p>objectives were “clear and simple: to degrade the ability of Saddam Hussein to build and </p>
<p>use weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> The impact of Operation Desert Fox is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> A Joint Memorandum produced by the Foreign and Defence Secretaries for the </p>
<p>Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP) in May 1999 described policy towards </p>
<p>Iraq as “in the short term, to reduce the threat Saddam poses to the region, including by </p>
<p>eliminating his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes”.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>13. </b> A summary of the evolution of the JIC Assessments of Iraq’s capabilities between </p>
<p>1990 and December 1998 is in Section 1.1. The Butler Report concluded that it had </p>
<p>been “left with four strong impressions” from its analysis of those Assessments:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… effective – but not demonstrably complete – work carried out by the IAEA </p>
<p>and UNSCOM to supervise the dismantlement of Iraq’s nuclear, biological </p>
<p>and chemical weapons programmes, together with those missile programmes </p>
<p>prohibited under United Nations Security Council resolution 687.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… a progressive reduction in JIC estimates of Iraq’s indigenous capabilities in </p>
<p>the period to 1994/95.</p>

<p>State for Defence, 17 May 1999, ‘Iraq: Future Strategy’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… growing suspicions and concerns underlying JIC Assessments between </p>
<p>1995 and 1998 of Iraq’s chemical, biological and ballistic missile capabilities, </p>
<p>which were exacerbated and reinforced by Iraqi prevarication, concealment and </p>
<p>deception.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> The Butler Report added that it had detected “signs that this context led to the JIC </p>
<p>making its estimates of Iraqi capabilities on an over-cautious or worst case basis” but </p>
<p>that was “not always declared as such”.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> The Butler Report also concluded that there were “differences in the quality of the </p>
<p>assessments carried out by the JIC” and contrasted the quality of the JIC Assessments </p>
<p>of Iraq’s nuclear capability during that time with those on chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>16. </b> On nuclear capabilities, the Butler Report stated that it had:</p>
<p>“… been impressed by intelligence assessments … They were generally thorough; </p>
<p>drew fully on both open and secret material; brought together human and technical </p>
<p>intelligence; offered a view where appropriate on the quality of the underlying </p>
<p>intelligence sources; were balanced and measured; identified explicitly those areas </p>
<p>where previous assessments had been wrong, and the reasons why, to correct </p>
<p>the record; and at each significant stage included consideration of alternative </p>
<p>hypotheses and scenarios, and provided an explanation of the consequences were </p>
<p>any to arise, to aid readers’ understanding.”</p>
<p><b>17. </b> In relation to the Assessments on chemical and biological weapons, the Butler </p>
<p>Report recognised that assessments were:</p>
<p>“… intrinsically more difficult, and that analysis draws on different intelligence </p>
<p>techniques. We are conscious in particular that, because chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons programmes can draw heavily on ‘dual use’ materials, it is easier for a </p>
<p>proliferating state to keep its programmes covert. The intelligence community will </p>
<p>also have had in mind that Iraq had used its chemical weapons in the past, and was </p>
<p>engaged in a sustained programme to try to deceive United Nations inspectors and </p>
<p>to conceal from them evidence of its prohibited programmes. Even so, we have </p>
<p>found JIC Assessments in these areas less assured. Our impression is that they </p>
<p>were less complete, especially in their considerations of alternative hypotheses; </p>
<p>used a different ‘burden of proof’ in testing Iraqi declarations; and hence inclined </p>
<p>towards over-cautious or worst case estimates, carrying with them a greater sense </p>
<p>of suspicion and an accompanying propensity to disbelieve.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>18. </b> After its withdrawal from Iraq, the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) produced </p>
<p>two reports on 25 January 1999, one on the disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and one on monitoring and verification, which were formally circulated to the </p>
<p>Security Council on 29 January.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>19. </b> The report on disarmament described the work of UNSCOM since 1991 and its </p>
<p>methodology and set out “material balances” for proscribed missiles and chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons in three detailed annexes. It also included an annex “on actions by </p>
<p>Iraq to obstruct disarmament”.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> In March 1999, the Amorim panel made a series of recommendations for changing </p>
<p>the regime of inspection.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>21. </b> After prolonged debate, resolution 1284, adopted on 17 December 1999, welcomed </p>
<p>the reports of the three panels chaired by Mr Celso Amorim, which had been subject </p>
<p>to “comprehensive consideration” by the Council, and stressed the “importance of a </p>
<p>comprehensive approach to the full implementation of all relevant Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions … and the need for Iraqi compliance with those resolutions”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The resolution replaced UNSCOM with the United Nations Monitoring, Verification </p>
<p>and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), which would operate as the Amorim panel </p>
<p>recommended, to provide “a reinforced system of ongoing monitoring and verification, </p>
<p>which will implement the plan approved by the Council in resolution 715 (1991) and </p>
<p>address unresolved disarmament issues”. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> There were significant differences about the interpretation of the resolution and the </p>
<p>way ahead. As a result, China, France, Malaysia and Russia abstained in the vote, but </p>
<p>there was no veto.</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>25. </b> On 19 April 2000, the JIC produced a substantial Assessment of Iraq’s chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons programmes.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>26. </b> In its Key Judgements, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our picture is limited. But it is likely that <b>Iraq is continuing to develop its </b></p>
<p><b>offensive chemical warfare (CW) and biological warfare (BW) capabilities</b>.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is <b>clear evidence of continuing Iraq biological warfare activity</b>, </p>
<p>including BW related <b>research</b> and the <b>production of BW agent</b>. Iraq seems </p>
<p>to be exploring the <b>use of mobile facilities to give its BW activities greater </b></p>
<p><b>security</b>. But we have <b>no evidence for Iraq filling weapons with biological </b></p>
<p><b>agent since the Gulf War</b>. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is <b>less evidence of continuing Iraqi chemical warfare activity, </b></p>
<p><b>including advances in binary weapons development</b> <b>and the</b> </p>
<p><b>reconstruction of suspect civil chemical production facilities</b>. There is <b>no </b></p>
<p><b>evidence of Iraq filling weapons with chemical agent since the Gulf War</b>.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The chances of detecting any production of biological warfare agent, or </b></p>
<p><b>small scale production of chemical agent, with or without UN inspections, </b></p>
<p><b>would be slim.</b> But we would expect to detect evidence of the production of </p>
<p>large quantities of chemical agent, with or without UN inspectors.”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The Assessment stated that Iraq’s doctrine for offensive chemical and biological </p>
<p>warfare remained “unclear”. It had used chemical weapons for internal repression and </p>
<p>against Iran in the 1980s and the JIC judged that it “would be prepared to use such </p>
<p>weapons again in similar circumstances, and, in extremis, in defence of the regime”. </p>
<p>The JIC warned that since the departure of UNSCOM in December 1998, its picture was </p>
<p>“limited” and had been “further reduced”. Iraqi officials were “well practised in concealing </p>
<p>such programmes”. Increased procurement of dual use equipment and materials could </p>
<p>not be linked to chemical and biological warfare programmes. There were indications of </p>
<p>continuing progress. The JIC did not know if those were “accelerating”; but the departure </p>
<p>of the inspectors had removed “a constraint”. </p>
<p><b>28. </b> In relation to Iraq’s chemical warfare activity, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “could have hidden dual use precursor chemicals and production </p>
<p>equipment” and the JIC continued “to assess that even with UNMOVIC and </p>
<p>other UN controls, Iraq could produce mustard agent within weeks of a decision </p>
<p>to do so. Iraq could produce limited quantities of nerve agent within months of </p>
<p>such a decision.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Procurement activities “<b>which could be associated with a chemical weapons </b></p>
<p><b>programme</b>” had “<b>continued</b>”, including efforts to procure dual use chemicals, </p>
<p>and attempts to procure crop spraying aircraft and protective suits.</p>
<p>9 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, 19 April 2000, ‘Iraq: Chemical and Biological Weapons Programmes’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Facilities “<b>formerly associated with Iraq’s chemical warfare programme at … </b></p>
<p><b>Habbaniyah</b>” were “<b>being reconstructed</b>”. There were signs of “renewed </p>
<p>activities” but “no firm evidence” that activity was “chemical weapons related, or </p>
<p>of the precursor plant which would be needed to produce CW agent”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “restoring its civil chemical production capability, including pesticides” </p>
<p>and the JIC assessed that “would help any revival of its CW programme”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “could be modifying bombs […] aerial bombs, procured in the 1980s, </p>
<p>for delivery of chemical warfare agents […] a significant advance in Iraqi </p>
<p>development of a binary type munition”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that Iraq was “likely to be continuing to develop” its knowledge of </p>
<p>chemical weapons “and other aspects of its CW capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> In relation to Iraq’s biological warfare activity, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “never revealed” the full extent of its offensive biological warfare </p>
<p>programme to UNSCOM although it had admitted to “laboratory work on a </p>
<p>range of BW agents” and that anthrax spores, botulinum toxin and aflatoxin </p>
<p>were “produced in bulk”. Bombs and missile warheads had been “filled with </p>
<p>these agents immediately prior to the Gulf War”. Iraq had “yet to make a credible </p>
<p>‘Full, Final and Complete Declaration’ of BW activity required by the UN”, and </p>
<p>its claims that it had “terminated its programme at the end of the Gulf War” had </p>
<p>“failed to convince” the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC assessed that Iraq was “likely to have concealed BW production </p>
<p>equipment, agent stocks and weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC continued “to assess that, even without procurement from abroad, </p>
<p>Iraq has retained sufficient expertise, equipment and materials to produce BW </p>
<p>agents within weeks using its legitimate biotechnology facilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had been “trying to procure <b>dual use materials and equipment</b> which </p>
<p>could be used for a BW programme”, but it was “impossible to determine” </p>
<p>whether the procurement was for a BW programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were indications that, contrary to its claims to have terminated the </p>
<p>BW programme at the end of the Gulf War, during the last decade, Iraq had </p>
<p>continued to conduct research on a range of biological agents using personnel </p>
<p>known to have been connected with the programme before 1991. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A recent piece of liaison intelligence reported that Iraq had started to <b>produce </b></p>
<p><b>biological agent in ‘mobile production centres’</b>.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“According to an Iraqi defector, planning for the project had begun in 1995 </p>
<p>under Dr Rihab Taha … known to have played a central role in Iraq’s BW </p>
<p>programme.” There were “reportedly six mobile production centres, with one </p>
<p>under construction. As of March 1999, three of these were fully functional and </p>
<p>work was under way to enable the production of five unspecified BW agents. </p>
<p>At one of these sites, some 20-30 tonnes of primary product were reportedly </p>

<p>The JIC assessed that those quantities of agent “could produce significant </p>
<p>casualties”.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“<b>Iraq seems to be exploring the use of mobile facilities to give its biological </b></p>
<p><b>warfare activities greater security.</b> The Iraqis had mobile … facilities for filling </p>
<p>chemical weapons at the time of the Gulf War. We know that senior Iraqis have </p>
<p>told UNSCOM that the use of mobile facilities was considered during the planning </p>
<p>of their one dedicated BW facility. But we have no other evidence for BW mobile </p>
<p>production centres. We judge that it would be technically feasible for Iraq to produce </p>
<p>20-30 tonnes of … BW agent … We have no evidence for Iraq filling weapons with </p>
<p>biological agent since the Gulf War. But for practical reasons, advance stockpiling of </p>
<p>some BW agents is less likely than for CW agents.</p>
<p>“In the light of this and other evidence of Iraqi illicit procurement of dual use </p>
<p>equipment and materials, we judge that Iraq is likely to be continuing to develop its </p>
<p>BW capabilities.” </p>
<p><b>31.  The Butler Report stated that the Key Judgement on Iraq’s biological warfare </b></p>

<p><b>32. </b> Considering the Assessment in 2004, the Butler Report stated that the firmer </p>
<p>assessment (that there was “clear evidence” of continuing BW activity) in the </p>
<p>Key Judgement:</p>
<p>“… was based on two new strands of evidence. The first was intelligence reports on </p>
<p>aspects of Iraqi research and development activities in 1997/1998. The second, and </p>
<p>more significant, was new intelligence from a liaison service received a few days </p>

<p><b>33. </b> The Butler Report stated that the language in the Assessment on mobile </p>

<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 1 DECEMBER 2000</p>
<p><b>36.  As part of the inter-departmental review of policy on Iraq in late 2000, the JIC </b></p>
<p><b>judged that:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>It was likely that Iraq had a limited residual WMD and prohibited long-</b></p>
<p><b>range missile capability. </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Since the departure of inspectors, the pace and scope of Iraq’s missile </b></p>
<p><b>research and development programme had increased.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Without sanctions and UN monitoring, Iraq would accelerate its WMD and </b></p>
<p><b>missile programmes.</b></p>
<p><b>37. </b> A JIC Assessment of the prospects for Iraq co-operating with resolution 1284 (1999) </p>
<p>on 1 November 2000, judged that Saddam Hussein’s “ambitions to rebuild … weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction programmes” would “make him hostile to intrusive inspections or </p>
<p>any other constraints likely to be effective”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>38. </b> In December 2000, at the request of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat (OD Sec), the JIC produced an Assessment of Iraq’s capability to threaten its </p>
<p>neighbours with conventional forces and weapons of mass destruction, and an analysis </p>
<p>of how changes in the sanctions regime might affect those judgements, to inform the </p>
<p>inter-departmental policy review on Iraq.</p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 1 December 2000: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq’s Military Capabilities’ </b></p>
<p><b>The residual threat from WMD</b></p>
<p>Assessing whether there was a “<b>residual threat</b>” from Iraq’s WMD, the JIC stated that </p>
<p>“most of [its] <b>ballistic missiles, chemical weapons</b> and nuclear programme have been </p>
<p>destroyed”. Iraq had claimed to have destroyed its biological weapons capability but </p>
<p>that could not be confirmed. It was “likely” that Iraq had a “<b>residual WMD and missile </b></p>
<p><b>capability</b>”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “handful of ageing SCUD-derived <b>missiles</b> with a <b>range of up to 650km</b>” </p>
<p>[the Al Hussein] were “probably disassembled and concealed”. Those “could be </p>
<p>re-assembled quickly [‘within weeks’] and used (albeit with limited accuracy) </p>
<p>against targets in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and even Israel”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“some <b>chemical and biological agent</b> may be concealed, possibly weaponised”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “developed a <b>missile with a range of 150km</b> [the Al Samoud], which </p>
<p>is permitted under UN controls. Although not fully operational, this could reach </p>
<p>Kuwait and Saudi Arabia”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “converting the L-29 jet trainer aircraft into a crude <b>remotely piloted </b></p>
<p><b>vehicle</b> which could carry an explosive, chemical or biological weapon to Kuwait </p>
<p>and against other targets in the northern Gulf”.</p>
<p><b>Prospects for the future </b></p>
<p>The JIC stated that “in the absence of UN inspectors”, since December 1998, Iraq had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… increased the pace and scope of its <b>missile</b> research and development </p>
<p>programmes. Series <b>production</b>” of the Al Samoud missile “<b>could begin within </b></p>
<p><b>months</b>”. A “longer range version (up to 200km)” was “being worked on”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence” of a revival in the Al Hussein programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“According to intelligence preliminary work” was “under way on another missile </p>
<p>with a possible range of over 700km”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence suggested “some <b>biological </b>and <b>chemical</b> warfare activity”. Iraq was </p>
<p>“rebuilding its civil chemical industry, including facilities formerly associated with </p>
<p>chemical weapons”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that “<b>Iraq may already be producing biological agent and </b></p>
<p><b>could produce a small number of chemical weapons within weeks</b> of a </p>
<p>decision to do so”; and, “were economic sanctions lifted”, Iraq could “build a <b>large </b></p>
<p><b>scale production capability within a few years</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The same was “probably true for <b>biological weapons</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “little evidence of <b>nuclear</b> weapons research”: but, “as in all areas of </p>
<p>WMD”, Iraq retained “expertise” and was “trying to buy dual-use materials”.</p>
<p>The JIC judged that Saddam Hussein would “<b>seek to re-establish all his WMD and </b></p>
<p><b>missile programmes</b>”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>effective UNMOVIC and IAEA monitoring</b> would act as a <b>deterrent</b> and </p>
<p>constraint to his ambitions, in particular on the nuclear and longer range missile </p>
<p>programmes. But it would be less effective in monitoring Iraq’s development of </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons, which could be more easily concealed;</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>without economic sanctions</b> but with <b>effective UN monitoring</b>, Iraq could </p>
<p>conduct research and development on longer range missiles. It could not, </p>
<p>however, put them into production. Its ability to rebuild a dedicated chemical </p>
<p>weapons or large scale biological weapons production capability would be </p>
<p>constrained. But Iraq could use its restored civil chemical industry and existing </p>
<p>biotechnology industry to produce chemical and biological agent. Effective UN </p>
<p>monitoring would act as a deterrent to Iraqi development of its nuclear ambitions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>without either economic sanctions or an effective UN monitoring presence, Iraq </p>
<p>would significantly increase its procurement and accelerate its WMD and missile </p>
<p>programmes. Iraq could begin to produce a small number of new … Al Hussein </p>
<p>missiles within a year. We would be less likely to detect progress in other areas. </p>
<p>It would take Iraq at least five years to make a crude nuclear device and a further </p>
<p>two years to manufacture a nuclear warhead for missiles.”</p>
<p>The Assessment stated if economic sanctions were lifted, military sanctions would </p>
<p>remain in place for some time. If they were eventually lifted “both Saddam Hussein and </p>
<p>any likely successor” were “likely to give <b>high priority</b>” to restoring military capability, </p>
<p>“<b>including WMD</b>”.</p>
<p>How sanctions and UN monitoring had affected the development of Iraq’s WMD and </p>
<p>ballistic missile programmes, and how the progressive lifting of both would affect the </p>
<p>future of Iraq’s WMD capability against its neighbours, was examined in more detail in </p>
<p>an Annex to the Assessment. That included:</p>
<p><b>Ballistic missile capability</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that, following the Gulf War, Iraq had “probably concealed </p>
<p>components and a small number of … Al Hussein missiles”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since 1991, Iraq had “expanded its liquid propellant expertise with the Al Samoud </p>
<p>missile”. Development of the missile had “<b>accelerated</b> over the past year as a </p>
<p>result of increased funding and Saddam Hussein’s personal interest” and “Iraq </p>
<p>had also been working on extending its range to at least 200km”. Iraq believed </p>
<p>that “with further imports, they could complete development work for this version </p>
<p>within 6 months”. Iraq was “also expanding a number of sites associated with its </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>solid fuel missile programme”. “Preliminary work” was “under way on the 150km </p>
<p>Ababil-100”. Iraq “would continue with the development” of that missile and “the </p>
<p>longer range solid propellant project”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Series production of Al Samoud could begin within months</b>. A longer range </p>
<p>version might be developed over the same period.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “could <b>assemble a number of Al Hussein missiles for deployment </b></p>
<p><b>within weeks</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Without trade sanctions and UN monitoring, <b>Iraq could produce a small </b></p>
<p><b>number of new Al Hussein missiles within a year</b>.”</p>
<p><b>Chemical warfare programmes</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“All known CW production facilities and dedicated precursor plants were </p>
<p>disassembled or destroyed during the Gulf Conflict or subsequently under </p>
<p>UNSCOM supervision”; but “agents, munitions, warheads, precursor chemicals </p>
<p>and production equipment” could have been concealed from UN inspectors. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sanctions and monitoring had slowed “<b>reconstruction of some of the facilities </b></p>
<p><b>formerly associated with</b>” Iraq’s CW programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While there was “no firm evidence of a chemical warfare programme”, Iraq had </p>
<p>“continued to acquire <b>dual use chemicals</b> and conduct research”. That “and </p>
<p>intelligence of <b>research into weaponising</b> aerial <b>bombs</b> suggests that some </p>
<p>chemical warfare activity continues”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “<b>could produce small but significant amounts of mustard agent within </b></p>
<p><b>weeks</b> of a decision to do so. It <b>could produce nerve agent within months</b> … It </p>
<p>could <b>also produce small numbers of CW munitions and missile warheads</b>.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Were trade sanctions lifted, and in the absence of UNMOVIC, Iraq could </p>
<p>re-establish a large scale production capability within a few years.”</p>
<p><b>Biological warfare programme</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “claimed to have … destroyed all … materials and weapons” related to its </p>
<p>biological warfare programme, but the JIC judged that it might “retain hidden </p>
<p>production equipment, stocks of agent and even biological weapons”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sanctions had “slowed but not prevented imports of dual use equipment that could </p>
<p>be used in a BW programme”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq still had “<b>sufficient expertise, equipment and material to produce BW</b> </p>
<p>without procurement from abroad. It could <b>use legitimate civil or dedicated BW </b></p>
<p><b>facilities, including mobile laboratories</b>, for this work.”</p>
<p><b>Nuclear weapons programme</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “retained the scientific cadre associated with nuclear weapons work. Iraqi </p>
<p>entities, some formerly associated with its nuclear programme, seek <b>dual use </b></p>
<p><b>equipment that could be used in association with a centrifuge programme</b>. </p>
<p>Unconfirmed intelligence indicates <b>Iraqi interest in acquiring uranium and </b></p>
<p><b>continuing nuclear weapons related research after the Gulf War</b>. None of </p>
<p>the intelligence acquired since the war is ‘smoking gun’ evidence. But it remains </p>
<p>suspicious and seems indicative of attempts to retain a cadre of expertise, which </p>
<p>will decline over time without international access.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq still lacked “fissile material and the infrastructure to make it”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq were “able to acquire sufficient fissile [material] for a weapon or centrifuges </p>
<p>and feed material from outside Iraq”, the time periods to manufacture a crude </p>
<p>nuclear weapon and a nuclear warhead could, “with foreign assistance”, be </p>
<p>“significantly shortened, with or without current controls”.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> The JIC’s conclusions in relation to Iraq’s threat to its neighbours are set out in </p>
<p>Section 1.2. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> The Butler Report stated that the intelligence supporting the judgements on Iraq’s </p>
<p>research and development programmes for ballistic missiles “came from a range of </p>
<p>sources”, and was “substantial”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Addressing the intelligence underpinning the Assessment on Iraq’s nuclear </p>
<p>activities, the Butler Report stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence had detected a visit of Iraqi officials to Niger in 1999,</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> and some </p>
<p>details had subsequently been confirmed by Iraq. The purpose of the visit was </p>
<p>not immediately known but, in the circumstances, including Iraq’s previous </p>
<p>purchases of uranium ore from Niger, the JIC judged that the purchase of </p>
<p>uranium ore could have been the subject of discussions and noted that </p>
<p>unconfirmed intelligence indicated Iraqi interest in acquiring uranium.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There was further and separate intelligence that in 1999 the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>had also made inquiries about the purchase of uranium ore in the Democratic </p>
<p>Republic of Congo.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The description of the intelligence underpinning the statement on Iraq’s interest </p>
<p>in acquiring uranium from Africa was “represented correctly by the JIC”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The statements in the Assessment about Iraqi attempts to procure dual use </p>
<p>equipment that could be used in association with a centrifuge programme fairly </p>

<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 9 FEBRUARY 2001:<b> </b>‘LONG RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT’</p>
<p><b>45.  In February 2001, the JIC assessed that Iraq was covertly working on long </b></p>
<p><b>range missile systems, but it would be unable to achieve an operational capability </b></p>
<p><b>while sanctions remained effective.</b></p>
<p><b>46.  Based on one recent intelligence report, the JIC suggested for the first time </b></p>
<p><b>that Iraq might have assembled “up to 20” Al Hussein missiles. </b></p>
<p><b>47. </b> The JIC issued an updated Assessment of the “long range ballistic missile intentions </p>
<p>and capabilities of North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya and their likely development over </p>
<p>the next 10-15 years” on 9 February 2001.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> Those four countries were the only states </p>
<p>currently developing long range ballistic missiles (with ranges over 1,000km) which were </p>
<p>of concern to the UK. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> The Assessment stated that North Korea was the main proliferator of ballistic missile </p>
<p>technology. It also stated that Iran was developing long range missiles as part of what </p>
<p>was judged to be a regional policy to deter other actors, including Iraq.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> In its Key Judgements relevant to Iraq, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At present, none of them intends to attack the UK and <b>only North Korea</b> has a </p>
<p><b>clear intent</b> to develop a capability to <b>reach the US</b>. But their intentions could </p>
<p>change quickly. Our assessments must therefore concentrate on capabilities, </p>
<p>including both <b>worst case engineering judgements</b> and best estimates of the </p>
<p><b>likely timeframes</b> of their acquisition of usable … missiles. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq is covertly <b>developing ballistic missiles</b> that are <b>beyond the 150km </b></p>
<p><b>range permitted</b> … It could also be in the <b>early stages</b> of developing a <b>two </b></p>
<p><b>stage system with a possible range of 2,000km</b>. If successful, this would </p>
<p>significantly increase the threat Saddam poses in the region and could, in the </p>
<p>longer term, be developed to become a threat to the UK and US. At present, </p>
<p>however, Iraq’s <b>missile programmes</b> are <b>constrained by sanctions</b>. While </p>
<p>they remain effective, it is <b>unlikely that Iraq could achieve an operational </b></p>
<p><b>long range capability</b>.”</p>
<p><b>50. </b> The JIC Assessment stated: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “<b>known to want a capability to target Israel and Iran, and would </b></p>
<p><b>like to acquire a capability to reach the rest of the Gulf </b>”; and its “strategic </p>
<p>objectives” would “probably remain the same whether or not the current </p>
<p>Government remains in power”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC did “not know” whether an Iraqi Government “would aim to target </p>
<p>Western Europe or the US, but it would be a credible deterrent objective </p>
<p>for Saddam”.</p>

<p>JIC Assessment, 9 February 2001, ‘Long Range Ballistic Missile Threat’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any acquisition of long range missiles “would significantly increase Saddam’s </p>
<p>threat to the region and could, in the longer term, become a threat to the UK </p>
<p>and US”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the absence of the UN monitors, Iraq had “<b>increased the pace and scope of </b></p>
<p><b>its missile programmes</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The programmes were “at an early stage of development” and, while the </p>
<p>embargo remained effective, it was “<b>improbable that Iraq</b> could produce an </p>
<p><b>operational long range capability</b>”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC knew that Iraq had “retained key components of disassembled </p>
<p><b>650km range Al Hussein missiles</b>. Recent intelligence suggests that <b>they may </b></p>
<p><b>have assembled up to 20 of these</b> missiles.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had used its permitted programmes “to develop the expertise it acquired on </p>
<p>longer range systems before the Gulf War”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence indicated that “<b>Iraq may be working on a two stage solid </b></p>
<p><b>propellant missile capable of delivering a payload to a range of </b></p>
<p><b>some 2000km. </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “yet to develop successfully even its current short range solid propellant </p>
<p>system”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC assessed that “<b>Were sanctions lifted</b> … Iraq <b>could produce a missile </b></p>
<p><b>that could reach Europe</b>, and possibly <b>the UK within about six years and </b></p>
<p><b>one capable of reaching the US within ten years</b>.” Those timeframes “could </p>
<p>be shortened if Iraq received significant external assistance or was able to buy </p>
<p>North Korean missile kits”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “technically capable of arming a missile with a conventional, chemical </p>
<p>or biological warhead”.</p>

<p> The JIC judged it would take Iraq “at least seven years after the lifting of </p>

<p>The JIC could not yet “assess” what the payload would need to be for a nuclear </p>

<p>would “be able to develop the 500kg nuclear payload needed [for a missile] to </p>

<p>“… it may be that there really is no more we can say and that we will have to </p>
<p>rely on clever re-packaging. But our material compares unfavourably with fuller </p>
<p>and fresher briefings […] … I wonder whether it might be worth a meeting to go </p>

<p><b>66. </b> The JIC noted that its “<b>knowledge of developments</b>”<b> </b>in<b> </b>Iraq’s WMD and ballistic </p>
<p>missile programmes since December 1998 was “<b>patchy</b>”, but that “<b>intelligence gives </b></p>
<p><b>grounds</b> <b>for concern</b> and suggests that Iraq is becoming bolder in conducting activities </p>
<p>prohibited by UNSCR [UN Security Council resolution] 687”. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> The JIC knew “<b>most about Iraq’s ballistic missile programme</b>”, where there </p>
<p>had been “<b>a step change in progress</b>” over the previous two years. It knew that Iraq </p>
<p>was “<b>developing longer range systems</b> possibly up to 2,000km”, and had “good </p>
<p>intelligence on <b>research and development facilities</b>” but did “not<b> know where the </b></p>
<p><b>longer range missiles will be built</b>”. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> The JIC had “<b>no clear intelligence on Iraq’s nuclear programme</b>”. There was </p>
<p>“evidence of increased activity at Iraq’s only remaining nuclear facility and a growing </p>
<p>number of reports on <b>possible nuclear related procurement</b>”. </p>
<p><b>69. </b> The JIC judged but could not confirm that Iraq was “conducting <b>nuclear related </b></p>
<p><b>research and development</b> into the <b>enrichment of uranium</b> and could have longer </p>
<p>term plans to produce enriched uranium for a weapon. If successful, this <b>could reduce </b></p>
<p><b>the time needed to develop a nuclear warhead once sanctions were lifted</b>.”</p>
<p><b>70. </b> The JIC continued to assess that “while sanctions remain in place, Iraq cannot </p>
<p>indigenously develop and produce nuclear weapons. Were sanctions lifted, it would <b>take </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq at least five years to produce a nuclear device </b>and a<b> further two to produce a </b></p>
<p><b>warhead</b>.” </p>
<p><b>71. </b> The JIC had “<b>good intelligence of Iraq’s former chemical and biological warfare </b></p>
<p><b>(CBW) facilities</b>, their <b>limited reconstruction</b> and <b>civil production</b>”. That suggested “a </p>
<p>continuing research and development programme”. There was “additional unconfirmed </p>
<p>but credible <b>intelligence of weapons filling</b>”. But the JIC could not “confirm that </p>
<p>specific sites” were “being used for CBW related activity”. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> In the main body of the Assessment, the JIC:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>judged that intelligence reports reflected “<b>a continuing chemical warfare </b></p>
<p><b>programme</b>, including research and development, together with the possible </p>
<p>production and weaponisation of agent”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that the picture of Iraq’s BW programme was “unclear”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that Iraq’s CBW capability was “not new”, but represented “the <b>most </b></p>
<p><b>immediate Iraqi threat</b>”. </p>
<p><b>73. </b> Other key points in the Assessment are set out in the Box below. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 10 May 2001: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraqi WMD Programmes: Status and Vulnerability’</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence on Iraqi WMD was “difficult to obtain and to verify”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Little of the intelligence is, however, sufficiently clear to identify the exact status </p>
<p>and ultimate objectives of these programmes. Intelligence is clearest on Iraq’s </p>
<p><b>missile facilities and associated activities</b>.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Because of the need for raw materials and components from abroad, sanctions </p>
<p>remain an obstacle to the development of all Iraq’s WMD programmes.”</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s ballistic missile programme</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “<b>reliable intelligence of Iraq’s current short range ballistic missile </b></p>
<p><b>programmes</b>” and “a growing body of evidence that Iraq intends to develop </p>
<p>missiles well beyond its permitted range of 150km”. That “would represent <b>a step </b></p>
<p><b>change in Saddam Hussein’s military capabilities</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“An injection of an additional [US]$20 million and political pressure from Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein” appeared “to have <b>accelerated progress over the past year</b>”. That </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>“work on <b>extending the range of the Al Samoud missile to 200-300km</b> – </p>
<p>production could start within the year”; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>“work on a <b>further missile engine test stand with the capacity for much </b></p>
<p><b>larger engines than the Al Samoud, including SCUD</b>”; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>the intelligence was “less clear on longer term missile objectives”; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>“… tests on pairs of solid propellant motor cases. These are at a very early </p>
<p>stage of development, but <b>if combined in a missile</b>, they could have a </p>
<p>range of up to <b>2,000km</b> with a 500kg payload. Developed individually into </p>
<p>missiles, using the same payload, they could achieve a range of between </p>
<p><b>700-1,200km</b>.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC assessed that both the Al Samoud and its extended range version “could </p>
<p>deliver a conventional, chemical or biological warhead”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC did “<b>not know</b> the location of some 20 reassembled 650km range </p>
<p>Al Hussein missiles”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Apart from the construction of a large test stand”, there was “<b>nothing to indicate </b></p>
<p><b>plans to produce new SCUD type missiles</b>”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC did “not know enough about the possible 2,000km range missile to judge </p>
<p>a timescale for its completion”.</p>
<p><b>Chemical warfare programmes</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “good intelligence of <b>Iraq’s former CW associated facilities</b>”; </p>
<p>intelligence of “other related <b>CW activity, including possible weaponisation</b>” </p>
<p>was “<b>less clear</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC did “not know the location of pre-Gulf War CW related stocks or where </p>
<p>Iraq may have filled weapons. Such stocks would enable Iraq to use its chemical </p>
<p>industry to <b>produce significant amounts of mustard gas within weeks</b> of a </p>
<p>decision to do so, and <b>nerve agents within months</b>.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>Biological warfare programme</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “good <b>intelligence of one facility</b> that could be used to <b>support BW </b></p>
<p><b>agent production</b>. Other Intelligence which points to the possible research and </p>
<p><b>production of BW agent is unconfirmed</b>.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq retained “<b>equipment and materials to produce BW</b>” and it had “a <b>number </b></p>
<p><b>of delivery options</b>”; but there was “currently little evidence of BW activity at </p>
<p>facilities formerly associated with Iraq’s BW programme”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Assessment pointed to additional intelligence on “Iraqi <b>attempts to recruit </b></p>
<p><b>new scientists by people formerly associated with Iraq’s BW programme</b> to </p>
<p>work on <b>BW related research, including genetic engineering</b>”; “liaison reports </p>
<p>of at least <b>six mobile Iraqi BW production facilities</b> for a number of unidentified </p>
<p>agents”; and “evidence of increased activity at a former <b>BW associated plant in </b></p>
<p><b>Amariyah</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC continued to judge that “<b>Iraq could produce BW agent within weeks</b> of </p>
<p>a decision to do so”. </p>
<p><b>Iraq’s nuclear programme</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “recalled its nuclear scientists in 1998”. It had made “<b>efforts … </b></p>
<p><b>since 1998 to procure items that could be used in a uranium enrichment </b></p>
<p><b>programme using centrifuges</b>”.</p>
<p>Those included: “<b>aluminium pipes</b> [tubes]” and “<b>other dual use items</b>”.</p>
<p><b>Vulnerability of Iraq’s WMD programme </b></p>
<p>In relation to direct military action, the JIC judged that: “Although some WMD facilities </p>
<p>could be destroyed by direct military action, this would be <b>unlikely to have a significant </b></p>
<p><b>overall impact on Iraq’s WMD programmes</b>”. This was because:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>we do not know where all ballistic missile development is taking place. There </p>
<p>would be <b>some</b> <b>impact on Iraq’s permitted missile development programme, </b></p>
<p>but military action would at best <b>only delay the development of prohibited </b></p>
<p><b>longer range missiles</b>; </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>although targeting of Iraq’s remaining nuclear facility</b> might have some impact </p>
<p>on its nuclear programme, it would be <b>unlikely to eliminate all nuclear activity</b>, </p>
<p>some of which may be taking place at other sites;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>because much of Iraq’s CBW activity can be conducted in legitimate civil research </p>
<p>facilities, Iraq’s <b>CBW</b> programme is likely to be unaffected by action against </p>
<p>known suspect sites.”</p>
<p>The Assessment stated that “<b>targeting of suspected chemical or biological facilities </b></p>
<p><b>would be portrayed as attacks on the civil infrastructure</b> and would in any case </p>
<p>have limited or <b>no impact on Iraq’s ability to produce and weaponise chemical or </b></p>
<p><b>biological agent</b>”. </p>
<p>The Assessment concluded:</p>
<p>“… <b>our ability to constrain Iraqi development of its WMD through other </b></p>
<p><b>means is limited</b>. The development of Iraq’s WMD has been helped in recent </p>
<p>years by <b>the absence of UN inspectors, the increase in illegal border trade </b></p>
<p><b>and hard currency available to Iraq</b>. There have been an increasing number of </p>

<p>28</p>
<p>[…] reports on orders for illegal imports of missile related components and missile </p>
<p>related components and materials […] Because of the need for raw materials and </p>
<p>components from abroad, sanctions remain an obstacle to the development of all </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD programmes.”</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Under a heading “Implications”, the JIC observed:</p>
<p>“This Assessment underlines the importance of pursuing vigorously work on the </p>
<p>proposed UN controlled goods list, which would help sustain effective controls on </p>
<p>Iraqi WMD development.” </p>
<p><b>75. </b> The Butler Report commented that the Assessment “signalled a clear change in the </p>
<p>JIC’s perception”.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>76. </b> The Butler Report considered that the JIC judgements on Iraq’s ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes were “well-founded and properly expressed”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>77. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry that the intelligence on the ballistic missile programme </p>
<p>was “fuller, and in retrospect, proved to be more reliable”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> There was reliable reporting </p>
<p>on missile production at one site. Separate reporting about the retention of Al Hussein </p>
<p>missiles came from a source that was “characterised as regular and reliable”.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Miller added that the report on the retention of the Al Hussein missiles was from </p>
<p>“a year or two previously”, and that there was “a rather longer standing view that their </p>
<p>disposal hadn’t been properly accounted for”.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>79. </b> In relation to the judgement that Iraq was “conducting nuclear related research </p>
<p>and development into the enrichment of uranium and could have longer term plans to </p>
<p>produce enriched uranium for a weapon”, the Butler Report stated it: </p>
<p>“… was based on two human intelligence reports, both from new sources and </p>
<p>neither speaking from direct, current experience. Unusually in the nuclear field, we </p>
<p>conclude that those reports were given more weight in the JIC Assessment than </p>
<p>they could reasonably bear.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry that there was “limited” new intelligence underpinning the </p>

<p>36</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The Butler Report stated that the judgements on Iraq’s CW programme: </p>
<p>“appear to have been based on three main pieces of evidence:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A single report from a new source who reported details of a project </p>
<p>three years ago to integrate … VX into rocket artillery warheads and the </p>
<p>subsequent filling of 60 warheads.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A further single report from a new source, passing on the comments of a </p>
<p>subsource that he had been part of a project to produce the nerve agent VX </p>
<p>in the period to 1998, again three years earlier.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence pointing to the restoration of a facility formerly used for </p>
<p>production of chemical agent precursors and on shipments to the plant, </p>
<p>although there was no positive evidence that precursors had been produced.</p>
<p>“A further report from a liaison service on the establishment of a group of chemical </p>
<p>experts to work on the production of chemical agent using mobile facilities appears </p>
<p>to have been discounted by the JIC.”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>82. </b> The Butler Report concluded that the Assessment “reflected these reports fairly”; the </p>
<p>intelligence “applied mainly to historical (as opposed to current) activity and, even so, </p>
<p>was by no means conclusive”.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a new, UK human source at that time, “giving an account of </p>
<p>weaponisation of … VX in the mid- to late 1990s”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “another new source, with older reporting, about production in the </p>
<p>earlier 1990s”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reporting on VX “seemed to be reports to which we should pay serious </p>
<p>attention” from “people who would have been in a position to know”, although </p>
<p>one of them was “a new source”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Chemical production had been mentioned in the reporting “through liaison on </p>
<p>mobile laboratories … The view at the time by the technical experts was that </p>
<p>if there were mobile facilities … they were more likely to have a role in filling </p>

<p>and activity at a facility formerly associated with BW, the Butler Report stated that </p>
<p>the “additional intelligence” identified “came from human intelligence and imagery”. It </p>
<p>concluded that, “although the human intelligence was recording events that had taken </p>

<p>the past for chemical agent production.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “clear evidence of continuing biological warfare activity … [T]he </p>
<p>intelligence about mobile production laboratories … was taken seriously. And </p>
<p>… there was a lot of emphasis on the capability of Iraq’s … industry to start </p>
<p>production of agents very quickly if a decision was taken to do that.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq “were to extend” the range of permitted ballistic missiles and then “design </p>
<p>longer range missiles, that was given a lot of prominence in the assessment as </p>
<p>a step change in the progress they were making”.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>86. </b> Sir John subsequently added that the Assessment was:</p>

<p><b>89.  The possibility that terrorist groups might seek to use unconventional </b></p>
<p><b>weapons was, until the mid-1990s, considered unlikely.</b></p>
<p><b>90. </b> The Butler Review reported that JIC Assessments during the 1980s considered the </p>
<p>possibility that terrorist groups might seek to use unconventional weapons as “remote”.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>91. </b> In June 1989, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“We have no intelligence that any terrorist group makes CBW agents, possesses </p>
<p>any such agents or is currently contemplating attacks using CBW agents or other </p>
<p>toxic chemicals. The use of CBW agents by terrorists would generate widespread </p>
<p>fear and could cause large numbers of casualties … The mere threat of such use </p>
<p>could be sufficient to cause panic. </p>
<p>“A terrorist would need only small quantities of CW agents. The simpler ones could </p>
<p>in principle be made by anyone with a knowledge of A-level chemistry using readily </p>
<p>obtainable materials. We believe that terrorist organisations could also readily obtain </p>
<p>and handle without insurmountable difficulty, suitable bacteria, viruses and certain </p>
<p>toxins.</p>
<p>“Although CBW proliferation undoubtedly increases the risk that CBW agents could </p>
<p>be stolen … or even supplied to terrorists by state sponsors … this prospect must </p>
<p>be viewed against a background where many suitable agents can be manufactured </p>
<p>in small quantities using easily available materials. So far as terrorism is concerned, </p>
<p>proliferation (if it comes about) may not necessarily be much affected by the actions </p>
<p>of States with the relevant capability.”</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>92. </b> In July, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“We believe that even the most sophisticated and well-organised terrorist group is </p>
<p>highly unlikely to be able to steal and then detonate a nuclear weapon within the </p>
<p>foreseeable future … At present the most feasible terrorist nuclear incident would </p>
<p>probably be a credible hoax …”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>93. </b> In April 1992, the JIC considered the technical options for terrorist attacks using </p>
<p>chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons, but emphasised the perceived </p>
<p>difficulties, stating that terrorist groups might:</p>
<p>“… be deterred by the danger to their own members, or by the risk of alienating the </p>
<p>public and especially their own supporters. They may also fear that an attack would </p>
<p>cause international outrage leading to determined efforts on an international scale </p>

<p>procure, and offer equal or greater effectiveness against traditional targets …”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>94. </b> In the context of reports of fissile material being available on the black market, the </p>
<p>JIC concluded in April 1994 that it was:</p>
<p>“… extremely unlikely that a terrorist group could produce even a crude nuclear </p>
<p>device; nor is there any evidence that any group has contemplated the use of </p>
<p>nuclear weapons. A more plausible scenario might be the dispersal of radioactive </p>
<p>materials …</p>
<p>“We believe that terrorists would not be able to acquire or deploy a nuclear weapon; </p>
<p>radiological attacks are … unlikely.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p> “Attacks involving chemical or biological agents are also unlikely …” </p>
<p><b>96. </b> In an Assessment in July 1996, responding to a G7 declaration that special attention </p>
<p>should be paid to the threat of the use of nuclear, biological and chemical materials for </p>
<p>terrorist purposes, the JIC stated: </p>
<p>“There is no indication of any terrorist or other group showing interest in the use </p>
<p>of nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) materials against the UK. For a number </p>
<p>of reasons, conventional weapons are likely to remain more attractive for terrorist </p>
<p>purposes. But last year’s nerve agent attack in Tokyo [the use of sarin by the </p>
<p>Aum Shinrikyo sect in the Tokyo underground in March 1995] will have heightened </p>
<p>interest and, with ever more NBC information publicly available, hoaxes threatening </p>
<p>NBC use are likely to become more difficult to assess.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>97.  After Usama Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan, evidence accumulated of his </b></p>
<p><b>interest in chemical and biological materials.</b></p>
<p><b>98. </b> Usama Bin Laden had first become known as a high-profile supporter of Islamist </p>
<p>extremism when fighting the Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>99. </b> He founded the international terrorist group known as Al Qaida in 1989, “dedicated </p>
<p>to opposing ‘un-Islamic’ governments in Muslim countries with force and violence”. He </p>
<p>was based in Afghanistan and Pakistan from 1989 to 1991, when he moved to Sudan. </p>
<p>Usama Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan in 1996. </p>

<p>33</p>
<p><b>100. </b> In response to the presence of the US in the Arabian Peninsula and its “continuing </p>
<p>aggression against the Iraqi people”, Usama Bin Laden and others issued a “fatwa” </p>
<p>in February 1998 stating that it was “an individual duty for every Muslim” to “kill the </p>
<p>Americans and their allies – civilian and military”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>101. </b> In November 1998, the JIC stated that Usama Bin Laden had:</p>
<p>“… a long-standing interest in the potential use of CBR [chemical, biological and </p>
<p>radiological] materials, and recent intelligence suggests his ideas about toxic </p>
<p>materials are maturing and being developed in more detail … There is also secret </p>
<p>reporting that he may have obtained some CB material – and that he is interested in </p>
<p>nuclear materials. We assess that he lacks the expertise or facilities even to begin </p>
<p>making a nuclear weapon, but he might seek to make a radiological device.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>102. </b> In an interview with the <i>BBC</i> and the London-published Arabic newspaper <i>Asharq </i></p>
<p><i>Al-Awsat</i> in December 1998, following Operation Desert Fox, Usama Bin Laden stated </p>
<p>that “The British and American people loudly declared their support for their leaders’ </p>
<p>decision to attack Iraq”, and that made it “the duty of Muslims to confront fight and kill” </p>
<p>citizens of the two countries.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>103. <i></b> BBC News</i> reported that Usama Bin Laden had stated that it was the duty of </p>
<p>Muslims to “get rid of all the Americans and all of the Jews out of the land of Islam”.</p>
<p><b>104.  In 1999, the JIC revised its position, concluding that some terrorists were no </b></p>

<p><b>105. </b> Following receipt of further intelligence, the JIC stated in June 1999: </p>
<p>“Most of UBL’s [Usama Bin Laden’s] planned attacks would use conventional </p>

<p>material and to develop a capability for its terrorist use. There is insufficient evidence </p>
<p>to conclude that he has yet acquired radiological or nuclear material. In contrast, </p>
<p>we now assess that his followers have access to some unspecified chemical or </p>
<p>biological material. Some have received basic training in its use against individuals </p>
<p>or in confined spaces.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>106. </b> In July 1999, the JIC changed one of the key assumptions underpinning previous </p>
<p>assessments, concluding that some terrorists were no longer reluctant to cause </p>
<p>mass casualties:</p>
<p>“Over the 1990s there has been a significant increase in the quantity and quality </p>
<p>of intelligence that some terrorists are interested in CBRN – and particularly in </p>
<p>chemical and biological materials – as weapons. The risk of a CBRN terrorist </p>
<p>incident has risen, albeit from a low base. In part this increase reflects the rise </p>
<p>of Islamic extremism and ethnic hatred as terrorist motivations: some of the </p>
<p>terrorists … are less constrained by considerations such as public support, </p>
<p>casualties among innocent bystanders, and the prospect of retaliation. It may </p>
<p>also reflect the increasing availability of information about making and using CB </p>
<p>materials … [S]ociety’s vulnerability to terrorist attack from CB or radiological </p>
<p>materials is high, exacerbated by the lack of a tried and tested CB counter-terrorist </p>
<p>response in some countries.”</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>107. </b> In addition, the JIC assessed that Usama Bin Laden had successfully acquired </p>
<p>non-conventional weapons: </p>
<p>“… It has become clear that Usama Bin Laden has been seeking CBRN materials … </p>
<p>His wealth permits him to fund procurement, training and experimentation to an </p>
<p>extent unmatched by other terrorists … Given the quantity and quality of intelligence </p>
<p>about his interests in CB materials, the length of time he has sought them, and the </p>
<p>relative ease with which they can be made, we assess that he has by now acquired </p>
<p>or made at least modest quantities of CB materials – even if their exact nature and </p>
<p>effectiveness are unclear. The significance of his possession of CB materials is </p>
<p>that, in contrast to other terrorists interested in CB, he wishes to target US, British </p>
<p>and other interests worldwide. There is also intelligence on training in the use of </p>
<p>chemicals as weapons in a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, although it is not yet clear </p>
<p>if this is under Bin Laden’s auspices … Bin Laden’s attacks remain more likely to </p>
<p>employ conventional weapons than CB materials.”</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>108. </b> The JIC retained its conclusion that:</p>
<p>“… the indications of terrorist interest in CBRN materials have yet to be matched by </p>
<p>a comparable amount of evidence about possession and intent to use CBRN. Most </p>
<p>terrorists continue to favour conventional weapons, as easier to use, more reliable, </p>
<p>safer and more controllable than CBRN materials.”</p>

<p><b>109. </b> Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) noted the US indictment of Usama Bin </p>
<p>Laden and deplored the fact that the Taliban continued to provide him with a safe haven </p>

<p>from which to sponsor international terrorist operations”.</p>
<p>57</p>

<p>demanded that the Taliban turn over Usama Bin Laden to a country where he </p>
<p>could be “effectively brought to justice”; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>111. </b> In January 2000, the JIC stated that :</p>

<p>(CBRN) materials and expertise. In autumn 1999 there was intelligence that he had </p>
<p>recruited … chemicals specialists … Our assessment remains that UBL has some </p>
<p>toxic chemical or biological materials, and an understanding of their utility … But we </p>
<p>have yet to see hard intelligence that he possesses genuine nuclear material.”</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>112. </b> By August 2000, the JIC concluded that, although other Islamist extremist groups </p>
<p>had an interest in non-conventional weapons, Usama Bin Laden posed the most severe </p>
<p>threat.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Addressing the terrorist threat from unconventional weapons in January 2001, </p>
<p>the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“The actual threat does not match the media hype. Almost all the available </p>
<p>intelligence refers to terrorist interest in CB materials, rather than to specific attack </p>
<p>plans. There is no credible intelligence that any terrorist except UBL has the </p>
<p>capability or serious intent to explore the use of weapons-grade materials – nor, </p>
<p>except for Chechen extremists, radiological material. Terrorists interested in CB are </p>
<p>generally those least constrained by public opinion … [T]he risks of attacks using </p>
<p>toxic materials have always been greater overseas.</p>

<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Sir William Ehrman, FCO Director International Security from 2000 to October </p>

<p><b>121.  Following the 9/11 attacks, the JIC assessed on 18 September that they had </b></p>
<p><b>set a new benchmark for terrorist atrocity, and that terrorists seeking comparable </b></p>
<p><b>impact might seek to use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear devices. </b></p>
<p><b>But only Islamic extremists such as those who shared Usama Bin Laden’s agenda </b></p>
<p><b>had the motivation to pursue attacks with the deliberate aim of causing maximum </b></p>

<p><b>122.  The potential threat to UK interests would be higher the more closely the UK </b></p>
<p><b>was identified with the US.</b></p>
<p><b>123. </b> Following a request from Mr Blair for a reassessment of the nature and scale of the </p>
<p>threat posed to the UK by terrorism and the contingency plans for dealing with it, the JIC </p>
<p>considered whether the scale and nature of the terrorist threat to the UK had changed.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>124. </b> The key points made in discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The attacks “marked a step change” and: “What had before been only an </p>
<p>assessed possibility had now become a fact. A new benchmark had been set, </p>
<p>and there could be no going back to the status quo ante.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Even if the component parts of those attacks had not been wholly new, their </p>
<p>sheer audacity, scale, co-ordination and ambition were novel.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The terrorists with creativity and imagination would look for other ways to </p>
<p>make as much impact. The draft [Assessment] needed to say more about the </p>
<p>threat from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism, which it </p>
<p>underplayed.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The paper needed to include some blue-sky thinking about what the future </p>
<p>might hold, but to maintain a sense of proportion.”</p>
<p><b>125. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded that “the draft needed reworking, in terms of both of its </p>
<p>structure and framework, and of its detail”. A revised version would be circulated for </p>
<p>further comment. </p>
<p><b>126. </b> The Assessment, issued on 18 September, considered whether the attacks of </p>
<p>11 September changed the nature and scale of the terrorist threat to the UK, and the </p>
<p>UK’s potential vulnerability to major terrorist attack, and “the current and immediately </p>
<p>foreseeable threat in terms of the intention and capability of known terrorist groups”.</p>

<p>“Terrorists seeking comparable impact may try to use chemical, biological </p>
<p>radiological or nuclear devices …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “potential scope for terrorist attacks” was “very wide”: “But in order to </p>
<p>assess the threat to the UK, we need to consider both the capabilities and the </p>
<p>intentions of the terrorist groups.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Only Islamic extremists such as those who shared Usama Bin Laden’s agenda </p>
<p>currently have the motivation to pursue” attacks “with the deliberate aim of </p>
<p>causing maximum casualties”. The more closely the UK was identified with the </p>
<p>US, “the higher the potential threat” to UK interests “both here and overseas”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Major attacks like those of 9/11 required considerable planning and were </p>
<p>“therefore likely to remain relatively infrequent”.</p>
<p><b>128. </b>  Addressing the nature of international terrorist groups, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“The word ‘groups’ can be misleading in the context of <i>Islamic extremist terrorists</i>. </p>
<p>There are established groups in different countries, usually working to a national </p>
<p>agenda, but the networks associated with UBL are changeable ad hoc groupings </p>
<p>of individuals who share his agenda, and who may come together only for a </p>
<p>particular operation.” </p>
<p><b>129. </b> The Assessment stated that it was “not yet clear” whether the success of the 9/11 </p>
<p>attacks would:</p>
<p>“… alter how international terrorist groups view the context in which they operate. </p>
<p>But it has certainly changed the psychological landscape. What had seemed </p>
<p>a remote possibility has become a fact … Copycat attacks could follow. Some </p>
<p>terrorists might feel driven to match or exceed the scale of casualties in order </p>
<p>to achieve a comparable impact. Or they might seek the same sort of shock, for </p>
<p>example by using chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear devices. On the </p>
<p>other hand, the sheer horror of the destruction could lead to a backlash against </p>
<p>wanton attacks by those who have previously supported terrorists. And if the US </p>
<p>successfully mobilises a new coalition of allies to end … UBL’s career, some groups, </p>
<p>and especially supportive states, might be deterred. But it will be some time before </p>
<p>intelligence is able to build up a picture of the actual effect of the 11 September </p>
<p>attacks …”</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Conventional munitions or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), “now including </p>
<p>hijacked aircraft”, were “the most likely form of attack”. But there was a need to take into </p>
<p>account the “following potential threats”:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Chemical warfare agents:</b> UBL’s group was “assessed to have acquired a </p>
<p>limited and unsophisticated chemical capability” and had been “reported at one </p>
<p>stage to have seen potential use in assassinations and other attacks in small, </p>
<p>confined spaces. But given time they might develop such ideas into plans to </p>
<p>cause large numbers of casualties.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Some biological warfare agents:</b> Intelligence had indicated that “UBL and </p>
<p>other Islamic extremists” had “shown an interest in BW agents and their effects”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Radiological dispersal devices:</b> There was “a considerable body of </p>
<p>intelligence relating to trafficking in illicit nuclear materials, and intelligence that </p>
<p>UBL possesses a small quantity of uranium. The use of uranium in a radiological </p>
<p>dispersal device is extremely ineffective, and does not present anything other </p>
<p>than the most minor of radiological hazards.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Improvised nuclear device:</b> This would be “harder to design and build than </p>
<p>a radiological dispersal device. […] Such a device would be large, fragile and </p>
<p>probably unreliable. It would need to be delivered by a vehicle or boat, or </p>
<p>assembled in situ. […] Acquiring the fissile material (plutonium or highly enriched </p>
<p>uranium) would be the major obstacle. No terrorists have the ability to make </p>
<p>fissile materials, and we have no evidence that any have acquired enough for a </p>
<p>weapon. A terrorist with explosives expertise could detonate a nuclear weapon </p>
<p>acquired from a nuclear-armed state, although it is unlikely to give its intended </p>
<p>yield, if any.” There was “no credible intelligence to suggest that UBL or any </p>
<p>other terrorist had acquired a nuclear device from the former Soviet Union”. </p>
<p><b>131. </b> The Assessment stated that the forms of possible attack from those threats were:</p>
<p>“… not new in themselves. We assessed in 1990 that Iraq could use chemical and </p>
<p>biological agents in covert attacks on western countries as well as in conflict. But </p>
<p>the 11 September attacks highlight the risk that extremist groups might turn to these </p>
<p>means of attack in order to maximise death and disruption. Unlike states – in most </p>
<p>circumstances – such terrorists cannot be deterred by the prospect of retaliation.</p>
<p>“Terrorists have already shown they can cause mass casualties by conventional </p>
<p>means … The difficulties in making or using chemical, biological, radiological or </p>
<p>nuclear weapons (CBRN), though by no means insurmountable, may make those </p>
<p>options less attractive to them. But CW and especially BW agents have the potential </p>
<p>to produce casualties in excess of those seen in New York. Hence any use, or threat </p>
<p>of use … would generate a degree of terror and panic out of proportion to the low </p>
<p>probability of a successful major attack.” </p>
<p><b>132. </b> Addressing who might have the capability and intent to threaten the UK, the </p>
<p>Assessment stated that Islamist extremists had the “motivation to attack the West” and </p>
<p>their means of operation made them “particularly difficult to identify and disrupt”. The </p>
<p>US was “their main target”. Most Islamic extremists had not targeted the UK “to date”, </p>
<p>but “the UK, France, Israel and ‘the West’ generally” were a “second rank in their </p>
<p>list of priorities”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>133. </b> The JIC judged that Hizballah, Hamas and Palestinian groups did not “currently </p>
<p>intend to target UK interests”. That “could change if the situation in the Middle East </p>
<p>deteriorates further”, but only Hizballah’s External Security Organisation had capability </p>
<p>to “carry out significant attacks”. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> Addressing the potential threat from Usama Bin Laden, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“In the context of UBL’s jihad, casualties and destruction could be an end in </p>
<p>themselves as much as a means to an end.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> He has no interest in negotiation and </p>
<p>there is no indication that he can be deterred. Further major attacks by those who </p>
<p>share his agenda cannot be ruled out, and may be more likely if UBL himself is killed </p>
<p>and/or the US retaliates against Afghanistan. While his focus remains on the US and </p>
<p>the Gulf, he has the capability to mount operations against the UK.”</p>
<p><b>135. </b> The Assessment concluded:</p>
<p>“Further attacks in the near future are possible … Nor should we conclude from the </p>
<p>volume of intelligence on Islamic extremists’ aspirations that we necessarily face an </p>
<p>escalating spiral of increasingly frequent attacks. Many will be disrupted … Major </p>
<p>attacks on anything like the scale seen in New York are likely to remain relatively </p>
<p>infrequent. But the capacity to undertake them demonstrably exists.”</p>
<p><b>136.  After 9/11, concerns in the UK about the risks of nuclear, biological, chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and ballistic missile proliferation intensified.</b></p>
<p><b>137. </b> In a speech addressing the Assembly on Terrorism on 1 October, Mr Kofi Annan, </p>
<p>the UN Secretary-General, stated that, after the attacks of 9/11, “no one can dispute the </p>
<p>nature of the terrorist threat, nor the need to meet it with a global response”.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> He added </p>
<p>that that would require:</p>
<p>“… Member States to live up to their responsibilities under international law. They </p>
<p>must deal firmly with the reality of armed groups and other non-State actors who </p>
<p>refuse to respect common principles of human dignity.</p>
<p>“It is hard to imagine how the tragedy of 11 September could have been worse. </p>
<p>Yet, the truth is that a single attack involving a nuclear or biological weapon could </p>
<p>have killed millions … The greatest danger arises from a non-State group – or </p>
<p>even an individual – acquiring and using a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon. </p>
<p>Such a weapon could be delivered without the need for any missile or any other </p>
<p>sophisticated delivery system.” </p>
<p>68 </p>
<p>“UBL’s stated objective is to secure US withdrawal from the Middle East or, failing that, to provoke a </p>
<p>reaction which would further demonise the US in the eyes of Muslims and destabilise moderate Arab </p>
<p>states that he perceives as un-Islamic.”</p>

<p>42</p>
<p><b>145. </b> Mr Straw was sent copies of the December 2000 and May 2001 JIC Assessments </p>
<p>in mid-November.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> He was told that the Key Judgements were “unchanged” and the </p>
<p>JIC would be reviewing its judgements and the “threat of onward proliferation of WMD </p>
<p>expertise and technology from Iraq to terrorist groups” later that month. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> The FCO informed Mr Straw that the main conclusions to be drawn included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “probably” had the capability to strike Israel and other countries “with </p>
<p>missiles tipped with chemical and biological warheads”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “highly unlikely” that Iraq possessed a nuclear weapon, but it had “the </p>
<p>motive and technology to develop a radiological device”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN sanctions had “prevented the reconstruction of Saddam’s conventional </p>
<p>military machine”. </p>
<p><b>147. </b>  The FCO advice also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Recent intelligence indicated that research and development on nuclear </p>
<p>weapons continued and that Iraq was seeking equipment for a uranium </p>
<p>enrichment programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s CBW capabilities were the “greatest concern”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was judged that Iraq “was able to conceal large quantities of chemical and </p>
<p>biological stocks”. </p>
<p><b>148. </b> The FCO also provided a copy of the “current press lines”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK believed the “Baghdad regime” was “still hiding weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction in a range of locations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Baghdad regime” had “continued to pursue ballistic missile, nuclear, </p>
<p>chemical and biological programmes in breach of its UN obligations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “admitted hiding chemical, biological weapons and missile parts in the </p>
<p>desert … caves and railway tunnels”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK believed Iraq still had “chemical and biological agents and the means to </p>
<p>deliver them in a range of locations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had admitted producing chemical and biological warfare agents, the effects </p>
<p>of which were “horrendous”.</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>149. </b> In support of the last statement the FCO identified:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued progress of Iraq’s ballistic missile programme and repair of facilities </p>
<p>damaged by Operation Desert Fox, and a belief that Iraq was planning to extend </p>
<p>the range of its permitted missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>concern about reports of increased nuclear procurement, a view that research </p>
<p>and development on a nuclear programme had restarted, and a belief that if </p>
<p>sanctions were lifted Iraq could develop a nuclear weapon within five years; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a belief that Iraq’s biological and chemical weapons programmes were </p>
<p>continuing. </p>
<p><b>150.  The JIC Assessment of 28 November judged that:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Practical co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was “unlikely”; and there </b></p>
<p><b>was no “credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related technology </b></p>
<p><b>and expertise to terrorist groups”.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq was “capable of constructing devices to disperse chemical or </b></p>
<p><b>biological agent, or radiological material”, but there was “no reliable </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence of any Iraqi intent”. If the regime was under serious and </b></p>
<p><b>imminent threat of collapse, WMD terrorism was possible but, in other </b></p>
<p><b>circumstances, the threat would be “slight”. </b></p>
<p><b>151. </b> At the request of the FCO, the JIC assessed Iraq’s support for terrorism on </p>
<p>28 November.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> The Assessment is addressed in Section 3.1.</p>
<p><b>152. </b> In relation to Iraq’s capabilities and the possibility of proliferation to terrorist groups, </p>
<p>the JIC Key Judgements stated that Saddam Hussein “would consider”:</p>
<p>“WMD terrorism, if his regime was under serious and imminent threat of collapse. In </p>
<p>other circumstances <b>the threat of WMD terrorism is slight</b>, because of the risk of </p>
<p>US retaliation.” </p>
<p><b>153. </b> The Assessment concluded that “Iraqi capability and willingness to conduct <b>WMD </b></p>
<p><b>terrorism</b>” was “not known with any certainty”. The JIC judged that Iraq was “capable of </p>
<p>constructing devices to disperse chemical or biological agent, or radiological material”, </p>
<p>but it had “no reliable intelligence of any Iraqi intent. Nor did it have:</p>
<p>“… any credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related technology and </p>
<p>expertise to terrorist groups, or of any Iraqi role in the anthrax attacks in the US. </p>
<p>Iraq would have to consider the risk of US retaliation … On balance, we judge the </p>

<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Miller described the main points as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “probably has a capability to target a limited number of ballistic missiles </p>
<p>against other countries in the Middle East and Gulf regions, particularly Israel”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “possible that such missiles could be armed with chemical or biological </p>
<p>warheads, although other conventional options for these weapons, such as </p>
<p>aircraft or artillery, are available”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While Iraq was “judged unlikely to be able to acquire any nuclear capability </p>

<p>Korea and Libya.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> The draft drew heavily on US published sources.</p>
<p><b>177. </b> Ms Hamilton-Eddy wrote that the aim was to include “relevant UK intelligence </p>

<p>Mr Blair and President Bush in April would “finalise Phase Two of the war against </p>

<p>Usama Bin Laden and the war in Afghanistan, it would be necessary to maintain public </p>
<p>and international support for military action against Saddam Hussein. That was a </p>

<p>48</p>
<p><b>183. </b> The JIC commissioned an Assessment of “Saddam’s threat perceptions and </p>
<p>internal position: whether he is secure, what opposition he faces and what he is doing to </p>
<p>try and avoid the internal and international threats he faces”.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>184. </b> In its discussion of the draft, the JIC decided that the final Assessment:</p>
<p>“… needed to say a bit more about Iraq’s aspirations and potential in terms of </p>
<p>Weapons of Mass Destruction, not least because this was, and would remain, an </p>
<p>important area for policy discussions with the US. The Pentagon’s views on how </p>
<p>soon Iraq might develop a nuclear capability did not quite match the UK’s, and it </p>
<p>would be useful for Ministers to know the JIC’s mind.”</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>185. </b> The Assessment, issued on 27 February, is addressed in detail in Section 3.2.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> In relation to Iraq’s WMD, a Key Judgement stated that Iraq continued: </p>
<p>“… to pursue its WMD programmes. Design work for missiles with ranges greater </p>
<p>than the UN limit of 150km was under way. If it has not already done so, Iraq could </p>
<p>produce significant quantities of biological warfare agent within days and chemical </p>
<p>warfare agents within weeks of a decision to do so.”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>187. </b> In relation to Iraq’s WMD capabilities, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“… Iraq continues to pursue the development of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>“Though we lack precise data, Iraq has probably reconstituted many of the elements </p>
<p>struck during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998. </p>
<p>“Iraq’s ballistic missile programme has extensively tested missiles under the </p>
<p>150km UN limit and intelligence indicates that design work for systems with ranges </p>
<p>over 1,000km is under way. </p>
<p>“Iraq is assessed to have hidden 10-20 Al Hussein missiles (range 650km) capable </p>
<p>of hitting Israel. </p>
<p>“Iraq also continues with its chemical and biological warfare (CBW) programmes </p>
<p>and, if it has not already done so, could produce significant quantities of BW </p>
<p>agent within days and CW agents within weeks of a decision to do so. These can </p>
<p>be delivered by a variety of means. Methods of ensuring survivability of CBW </p>
<p>production facilities from attack are a high priority.</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>“Before the [1991] Gulf War intervened, Iraqi plans were well advanced and we </p>
<p>judge they were only three years away from possessing a nuclear weapon. </p>
<p>“Were sanctions lifted now, we judge it would take Iraq at least five years to produce </p>
<p>a nuclear weapon and a further two to produce a warhead. </p>
<p>“The acquisition of fissile material or significant technical assistance from abroad </p>
<p>could significantly shorten this timescale. </p>
<p>“Iraq still has some low grade radioactive material which it could utilise in a </p>
<p>radiological dispersal device, but there is no recent intelligence indicating that Iraq is </p>
<p>pursuing such a course.” </p>
<p><b>188. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“… <b>even if inspectors were allowed to return, Iraq would embark on a renewed </b></p>
<p><b>policy of frustration</b>, involving denial, deception, obstruction and delay. Iraq would </p>
<p>be able to conceal from inspectors much of its CBW work and research on longer </p>
<p>range missiles, though probably not its missile production facilities.”</p>
<p><b>189. </b> The JIC concluded:</p>
<p>“… if Saddam believed he was unable to deter a US attack to oust his regime, we </p>
<p>judge he would go down fighting and could adopt high risk options, such as … using </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction against US forces or Israel.” </p>
<p><b>190. </b> The shortening of the timescale that Iraq would require to produce significant </p>
<p>quantities of BW agent from “weeks” in the JIC Assessment of May 2001 to “days” </p>
<p>was significant.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> The Butler Report stated that continuing reports on Iraqi mobile biological agent </p>
<p>production facilities, which were received from a liaison service, had had a significant </p>
<p>impact on the Assessment.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> The Butler Review had been told that was “based on a </p>
<p>more thorough understanding of the capabilities of the mobile production facilities, and </p>
<p>on [the] refurbishment of an Iraqi facility” which had been involved in research and </p>
<p>biological agent production before the Gulf Conflict.</p>

<p>50</p>
<p><b>194.  Mr Webb also advised that Iraq’s nuclear programme could move forward </b></p>
<p><b>more quickly if it obtained fissile material from abroad. </b></p>
<p><b>195. </b> Mr Webb, offered advice on the UK approach in response to President Bush’s </p>
<p>“axis of evil”’ speech to Mr Hoon on 27 February (see Section 6.1).</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr Webb recommended that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>acknowledge that the three countries identified by President Bush posed </p>
<p>increasing risks to international stability; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuade the US to explain why, releasing intelligence in a “road show”.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Webb also proposed adding Libya to the list of countries of concern. </p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Webb sent Mr Hoon summaries of material on WMD programmes which might </p>
<p>be released to European allies and informed him that the JIC was “working further on a </p>
<p>public version”.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> In relation to Iraq, Mr Webb wrote:</p>
<p>“Iraq came close to developing nuclear weapons before the Gulf War, with medium </p>
<p>range missiles. The containment policy since then halted her nuclear progress, </p>
<p>eg by UN inspection regimes and bombing in 1998. But Saddam has kept trying: </p>
<p>we do not currently assess him as having succeeded but the high level of technical </p>
<p>capacity that Iraq has sustained means that they could move forward quickly, </p>
<p>especially if Saddam could lay his hands on fissile material.”</p>
<p><b>200. </b> Mr Webb added that some of the programmes could be explained:</p>
<p>“… in regional terms: Iran and Iraq in particular respond to each other’s fears. </p>
<p>But once the capability exists, it will pose risks not just to each other but to the </p>
<p>wider region.”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Webb also identified the potential risks to deployed forces and UK bases such </p>
<p>as Cyprus, as well as the more general interest in stemming the tide of proliferation by </p>
<p>using non-military and military options. </p>
<p><b>202. </b> In the context of using international diplomatic pressure to control the proliferation </p>
<p>of WMD, Mr Webb described Saddam Hussein as “the strategic centre of gravity of Iraqi </p>
<p>WMD programmes”. He added that “unless we tackle some of those cheating on their </p>
<p>treaty obligations, the rest of the WMD regime will crumble”.</p>
<p><b>203. </b> The information sent to Mr Hoon about Iraq’s ballistic missile and biological warfare </p>
<p>programmes reflected the JIC Assessments. </p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>204. </b> On Iraq’s nuclear weapon programmes, Mr Hoon was told: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Until 1991 Iraq had a massive nuclear weapon project. If the Gulf War had not </p>
<p>intervened, it might have produced a crude nuclear device by late 1993. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It is assessed that Iraq has no capability to manufacture weapons-usable fissile </p>
<p>material. However, some dual-use material may still be in the inventory.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With the departure of the IAEA … in December 1998, Iraq could have </p>
<p>recommenced nuclear weapons activity as it retains skilled scientists and </p>
<p>weapons design information.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If sanctions were lifted or became ineffective Iraq could possibly develop its first </p>
<p>nuclear weapon – a crude weapon for air-delivery – in 5-7 years; and a further </p>
<p>2-3 years to produce a warhead for missile delivery. These timelines could be </p>
<p>shortened if it has procured fissile material from abroad.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> On Iraq’s chemical weapons programme, Mr Hoon was told:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We assess that Iraq probably retains a stockpile, which could easily amount to </p>
<p>more than 100 tonnes of agent.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has the capability to start the production of significant amounts of mustard </p>
<p>agent immediately, and the production of nerve agent within weeks of a decision </p>
<p>to do so.”</p>
<p><b>206. </b> In a letter of 27 February, Mr Ehrman questioned what was meant by the </p>
<p>description of Saddam Hussein as the centre of gravity of Iraq’s WMD programmes, </p>
<p>asking whether it was “too sanguine to suggest, if that is the intention, that his removal </p>
<p>would necessarily bring them to an end”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>207. </b> Mr Ehrman expressed surprise at Mr Webb’s assertion that “the bombing in 1998 </p>
<p>helped to halt Iraqi progress in developing nuclear weapons”, commenting that the FCO </p>
<p>understanding was that that was “not among the claims we made at the time”. </p>
<p><b>208. </b> The evidence in Section 1.1 on the dismantling of Iraq’s nuclear programme and </p>
<p>the objectives of Operation Desert Fox supports Mr Ehrman’s point. </p>
<p><b>209. </b> The UK’s understanding of the impact of Desert Fox is set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>Impact of Operation Desert Fox</b></p>
<p>The JIC assessed in May 2001 that Operation Desert Fox had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>set back parts of the ballistic missile programme by up to a year; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not attacked CW facilities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damaged the castor oil plant, but there was no known impact on BW capability;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>damaged the aircraft shelters associated with the L-29 trainer, but no aircraft had </p>
<p>been destroyed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disrupted security organisations involved in Iraq’s WMD, but those connected with </p>
<p>concealment were unlikely to have been damaged.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The CIG Assessment of 15 March 2002 stated that a “few high profile sites” associated </p>
<p>with Iraq’s ballistic missile programme had been targeted in the operation.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DIS advised in April 2002 that the “direct impact” of Operation Desert Fox on Iraq’s </p>
<p>CBW capabilities was “very limited, being confined to an attack on a single facility with BW </p>
<p>potential, with no attacks at all on CW-related facilities”.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DIS understood:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Desert Fox was not intended to eliminate Iraq’s ability to regenerate its </p>
<p><b>biological, chemical or nuclear weapons</b> programmes and had minimal effect </p>
<p>on this ability.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Even if the BW facility had been destroyed, “this would not greatly affect Iraq’s </p>
<p>capability to regenerate its BW programme”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialisation building, which was </p>
<p>presumed among other things to have been “the administrative centre for Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD programmes”, had “sustained moderate damage”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The value of the operation “from a WMD perspective” had been the damage to </p>
<p>“Iraq’s means of delivery”. The DIS’s internal assessment was that the “ballistic </p>
<p>missile programme had been set back by a year, and that damage to some </p>
<p>facilities could take up to another year to repair”.</p>
<p>Mr Webb told the Inquiry that, after Operation Desert Fox, it had been concluded it was </p>
<p>“not effective” and the MOD was “not able to offer any assurance that you would have </p>
<p>been able to deal with the WMD problem solely by air power”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Subsequently Mr Webb stated that the operation had “a very useful effect on reducing the </p>
<p>capacity of the Iraqi integrated air defence system” which was “posing a threat” to aircraft </p>
<p>enforcing the No-Fly Zones.</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>212. </b> The draft stated that it was “difficult to assess how close” Iraq was to “restoring </p>
<p>its WMD capability, since the withdrawal of UN inspectors”. The sanctions regime had </p>
<p>“hindered” reconstitution efforts, “although we believe these continue unabated”.</p>

<p><b>215. </b> On behalf of Mr Webb, Mr Paul Schulte, MOD Director, Proliferation and Arms </p>
<p>Control Secretariat, set out a number of concerns about the approach adopted, </p>
<p>including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the countries discussed in the paper were too narrow;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was a risk it would undermine the principle of not commenting on </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>it would lead to questions about the action being taken and criticism of </p>
<p>inaction.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr Webb suggested that the paper should address “only nuclear and missile </p>
<p>issues in detail” and limit the “concerns over CBW to a more general statement” given </p>
<p>that “In many cases, the arguments … are somewhat thin and unconvincing”.</p>

<p><b>Public statements by Mr Blair and Mr Straw</b></p>
<p><b>225.   From late February 2002, Mr Blair and Mr Straw began publicly to argue that </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with.</b></p>
<p><b>226. </b> In a memorandum to the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) in June 2003, the </p>
<p>FCO stated:</p>
<p>“In the early months of 2002, British Government statements underlined the singular </p>
<p>threat posed by Iraq’s behaviour.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia, Mr Blair </p>
<p>gave an interview to the <i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</i> on 28 February in which </p>
<p>he stated that he agreed with President Bush “very strongly that weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction represent a real threat to world stability”; and that: “Those who are engaged </p>
<p>in spreading weapons of mass destruction are engaged in an evil trade and it is </p>
<p>important that we make sure that we have taken action in respect of it.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>228. </b> Mr Blair also stated that: “The accumulation of weapons of mass destruction by </p>
<p>Iraq poses a threat, not just to the region but to the wider world.” President Bush was </p>
<p>“absolutely right to raise it”.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> On 3 March, Mr Blair was reported to have told <i>Channel Nine</i> in Australia that:</p>
<p>“We know they [Iraq] are trying to accumulate … weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>we know he’s prepared to use them. So this is a real issue but how we deal with it, </p>
<p>that’s a matter we must discuss.”</p>

<p><b>230. </b> Mr Blair was also reported to have argued that the lessons of 9/11 meant that such </p>
<p>threats must be tackled; and that “if we don’t act we will find out too late the potential </p>
<p>for destruction”. </p>
<p><b>231.  In an article published on 5 March, Mr Straw stated that if Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>refused to co-operate with weapons inspection, he would have to live with </b></p>
<p><b>the consequences.</b></p>
<p><b>232. </b> Mr Straw provided an article, published in <i>The Times</i> on 5 March, stating that: </p>
<p>“The stalemate between the United Nations and Iraq cannot go on for ever. For </p>
<p>more than a decade, Britain and the United States have led the UN’s efforts to </p>
<p>protect Iraq’s neighbours from aggression and protect the world from Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction.</p>
<p>“Iraq persistently flouts the authority of the UN Security Council and international </p>

<p>“The threat from Iraq is not receding. Unique among the world tyrants, Saddam has </p>
<p>both the ruthlessness and capability to employ weapons of mass destruction.”</p>

<p><b>233. </b> In relation to WMD the article stated that, since 1991:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… evidence has been building up that the threat from Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>programmes is growing once more”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Many of the facilities damaged in 1998 … in Operation Desert Fox had </p>
<p>been repaired.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “persisted with its chemical and biological weapons programmes” and </p>
<p>was “developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering such weapons to targets </p>
<p>beyond the 150km limit imposed by the UN”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “evidence of increased efforts to procure nuclear-related material </p>
<p>and technology, and that nuclear research and development work [has] </p>
<p>begun again”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Without the controls which had been imposed, “Saddam would have had a </p>
<p>nuclear bomb by now”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had “both the ruthlessness and capability to employ weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The regime had “admitted hiding” WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had admitted manufacturing chemical weapons and biological agents: </p>
<p>“The destructive potential of these weapons beggars the imagination.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“The international community’s most pressing demand” was that Iraq should </p>
<p>allow UN officials to inspect its weapons programmes. </p>

<p>“We cannot allow Saddam to hold a gun to the heads of his own people, his </p>
<p>neighbours and the world for ever. Intense diplomatic efforts will continue, and I hope </p>
<p>they will achieve our aim of removing the threat which Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>

<p>Saddam Hussein’s use of chemical weapons against Iraq’s people and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein remained “determined to retain and rebuild his Weapons of </p>
<p>Mass Destruction (WMD) and threaten the region”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “admitted hiding chemical, biological weapons and missile parts in the </p>
<p>desert and in railway tunnels”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We believe Iraq is still hiding WMD in a range of locations.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN inspectors had been unable to account for significant quantities of precursor </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“We fear Iraq is taking advantage of the absence of UN weapons inspectors to </p>
<p>rebuild its WMD.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq’s weapons programmes remained “unchecked”, Iraq “could redevelop </p>

<p>115</p>
<p> That was </p>
<p>that the development of a nuclear weapon would be possible only if UN sanctions were </p>

<p>‘unchecked’ (CBW programmes are another matter) …”</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Mr Dowse wrote that the difference was “small, but significant” and it raised an </p>

<p><b>248. </b> Mr Blair wrote that “we now have to face the fact that there are irresponsible states </p>
<p>which either have, or are actively seeking, biological, chemical and nuclear weapons”, </p>
<p>and that was a threat which President Bush had “rightly highlighted” in his State of the </p>
<p>Union speech on 29 January.</p>
<p><b>249. </b> In relation to the threat posed by Iraq, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We “know … from his own history that Saddam Hussein … has mass destruction </p>
<p>weapons and will use them …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN had “demanded” in 1991 “that its representatives should be allowed into </p>
<p>Iraq to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction and ensure he did not replace </p>
<p>them” because Saddam Hussein had “used chemical weapons repeatedly </p>
<p>against Iranian soldiers”, and had used them “against his own citizens when he </p>
<p>attacked Kurds in northern Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN weapons inspectors had “discovered and destroyed thousands of </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons, including thousands of litres of anthrax and </p>
<p>48 missiles” before they had been “kicked out”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors were “convinced” that Saddam Hussein had “hidden other deadly </p>
<p>arsenals and the plants to manufacture more” but could not track them down </p>
<p>because of “almost daily obstruction”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was important to “remain vigilant” about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>If he was not restrained, “a volatile situation in the region could easily become a </p>
<p>world crisis”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The fact that Saddam Hussein had been contained “for so long” did not mean </p>
<p>the threat had gone away, he was “continuing his chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons programmes and … the long-range missiles to deliver them”. </p>

<p>DRAFT ‘WMD PROGRAMMES OF CONCERN’ PAPER, 6 MARCH 2002</p>
<p><b>251.  Mr Scarlett told Sir David Manning that the draft paper for publication on </b></p>
<p><b>WMD programmes of concern had taken a maximalist line, but said little that had </b></p>
<p><b>not already been published by the US.</b></p>
<p><b>252. </b> Mr Scarlett sent a draft paper setting out the facts “for public use” on WMD </p>
<p>programmes of concern in Iraq, Iran, North Korea and Libya, which had been </p>
<p>commissioned on 19 February, to Sir David Manning on 6 March.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>253. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that there were:</p>
<p>“reservations on several points:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>acknowledging that specific judgements draw on intelligence;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>including material that we know only from intelligence sources;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>going further than before in our accusations …”</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Mr Scarlett added: </p>
<p>“We can discuss these issues (and indeed whether the paper should only focus on </p>
<p>Iraq) at your meeting tomorrow … while the draft does take a maximalist line, it goes </p>
<p>little further on most points than the material already published by the Americans (to </p>
<p>whom we are showing this version in parallel). </p>
<p>“Getting the presentational tone right will clearly be key. We will need to consider </p>
<p>at what stage to consult Alastair Campbell [Mr Blair’s Director of Communications </p>
<p>and Strategy]. Alastair is aware that the draft paper is being shown to you today and </p>
<p>stands ready to advise …”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>255. </b> The Introduction to the draft paper stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Several countries have WMD programmes and missile systems to deliver </p>
<p>nuclear, chemical or biological warheads. They are working to develop more </p>
<p>accurate and longer range missiles that will allow them to threaten more than </p>
<p>just their immediate neighbours.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Several countries that promised not to acquire nuclear weapons are trying to </p>
<p>build them; North Korea has probably already succeeded.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There are similar problems over chemical weapons … Saddam Hussein used </p>
<p>chemical weapons … as recently as the late 1980s.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Some countries also have or wish to acquire, biological weapons, some </p>
<p>of which have the potential to cause casualties on the same scale as </p>
<p>nuclear weapons.” </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“We know too that Usama Bin Laden’s Al Qaida has for several years tried to get </p>
<p>nuclear, chemical and biological agents. They had some success, and may even </p>
<p>have obtained some chemical, biological and radiological materials, before being </p>
<p>seriously disrupted by coalition action in Afghanistan. They will keep on trying.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“These facts are alarming. This paper sets out what the Government knows </p>
<p>about them, consistent with the protection of sensitive sources of information.” </p>
<p><b>256. </b> In relation to nuclear proliferation, the draft paper drew attention to the </p>
<p>“increasingly worrying evidence that several countries that have signed the NPT” were:</p>
<p>“… nonetheless seeking to breach the Treaty and acquire nuclear weapons. Such </p>
<p>actions are illegal and destabilising. The governments concerned are themselves </p>
<p>volatile and unpredictable. If these countries succeed in bypassing their international </p>
<p>obligations and acquire nuclear weapons, the world will become immeasurably </p>
<p>more dangerous.”</p>
<p><b>257. </b> The Summary of Iraq’s capabilities stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq is seeking a nuclear weapons capability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq is developing longer range ballistic missiles capable of delivering these </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction throughout the Middle East and Gulf Region.”</p>
<p><b>258. </b> In the section on Iraq, the draft paper stated:</p>
<p>“Successful enforcement of the sanctions regimes and the UN arms embargo have </p>
<p>hindered Iraq’s reconstitution efforts, although WMD programmes continue. Since </p>
<p>the withdrawal of inspectors in 1998, monitoring of Iraqi attempts to restore a WMD </p>
<p>capability has become more difficult.” </p>
<p><b>259. </b> The draft paper stated that Iraq had “Retained more than a dozen prohibited </p>
<p>Al Hussein (650km) missiles” and was “Working on designs for longer range missiles”. </p>
<p>It highlighted Iraq’s achievements pre-1991, the use of ballistic missiles during the </p>
<p>Iran-Iraq War and the 1991 Gulf Conflict, and, drawing on intelligence, Iraq’s more </p>
<p>recent activities. </p>
<p><b>260. </b> In relation to Iraq’s nuclear ambitions, the draft paper stated: “Iraq has a nuclear </p>
<p>weapons programme, but it is unable to produce fissile material while sanction[s] </p>
<p>remain in place.” The UK assessed that, in 1991, Iraq was “only three years away from </p>
<p>possessing a nuclear weapon”, and: </p>
<p>“Iraq still wants a nuclear weapons capability and is working to achieve it. Much of </p>
<p>their former expertise has been retained and there is intelligence that specialists </p>
<p>have been recalled to work on a nuclear weapons programme. But Iraq needs </p>
<p>certain key components and materials for the production of fissile material, which </p>
<p>would be necessary before a nuclear bomb could be developed. Iraq is covertly </p>

<p>aluminium, which is prohibited under the terms of international non-proliferation </p>
<p>agreements because of its potential application to gas centrifuges used to </p>
<p>enrich uranium.”</p>
<p><b>261. </b> As long as sanctions hindered the import of “crucial goods”, Iraq “would find it </p>
<p>difficult to produce a nuclear weapon”. It was assessed that “Iraq would need five years </p>
<p>to produce a weapon” if all sanctions were lifted, and progress would be “much quicker if </p>
<p>Iraq was able to buy suitable fissile material”.</p>
<p><b>262. </b> In relation to chemical and biological weapons, the draft paper stated: “Iraq has a </p>
<p>capability to produce CBW weapons at short notice.” It set out Iraq’s activities pre-1991, </p>
<p>including its use of chemical weapons against Iran and Kurds in Northern Iraq; its </p>
<p>history of denying its chemical and biological programmes; and the estimates of material </p>
<p>produced which the UN weapons inspectors had been unable to account for. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> The draft paper added that the UK assessed that Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… a covert chemical and biological weapons programme. All the necessary </p>
<p>expertise has been retained. Iraq appears to be installing or repairing dual use </p>
<p>equipment at suspect facilities, which could be used for chemical or biological </p>
<p>weapon production … Iraq is assessed to be self-sufficient in terms of producing </p>
<p>biological weapons.”</p>
<p><b>264. </b> The draft paper also stated that Iraq had developed “Strategies that enable key </p>
<p>parts of the chemical and biological weapons programme to survive a military strike”; </p>
<p>and that it was:</p>
<p>“… modifying L-29 light aircraft and seeking UAV [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle] </p>
<p>technology, which would be suited for delivery of chemical and biological weapons.”</p>
<p><b>265. </b> The draft paper was also sent to Sir Richard Wilson, Cabinet Secretary, the heads </p>
<p>of the intelligence Agencies, Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, AM French, </p>

<p>Security Council, and that Saddam Hussein’s: </p>
<p>“… regime continued to pose a threat to peace through its development of weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction (WMD) and the means to deliver them. UN weapons inspectors </p>
<p>had been forced to leave Iraq in 1998 because they were close to exposing the full </p>
<p>extent of Saddam’s programmes.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>274. </b> Mr Straw concluded: </p>
<p>“No decision had been taken on launching further military action … but, it was </p>

<p><b>275. </b> Cabinet Ministers raised a number of points in the subsequent discussion, </p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 7 March 2002. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>278.  Iraq’s WMD capabilities were briefly summarised in line with the JIC </b></p>
<p><b>Assessment of 27 February, including that Saddam Hussein would continue with </b></p>
<p><b>his WMD programmes.</b></p>
<p><b>279. </b> The Cabinet Office ‘Iraq: Options Paper’,<i> </i>commissioned by Sir David Manning </p>
<p>and co-ordinated by OD Sec, was sent to Mr Blair by Sir David on 8 March, as </p>
<p>part of the collection of “background briefs that you asked for” for the meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> The paper is addressed in detail in Section 3.2.</p>
<p><b>280. </b> In relation to WMD, the paper advised that containment had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>effectively frozen Iraq’s nuclear programme;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>prevented Iraq from rebuilding its conventional arsenal to pre-Gulf Conflict </p>
<p>levels;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>severely restricted Iraq’s ballistic missile programmes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hindered Iraq’s biological and chemical weapons programmes.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>281. </b>  The intelligence was “poor”; and there was no greater threat now that Saddam </p>
<p>would use WMD than there had been in recent years. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> The ‘Options Paper’ proposed consideration of a staged approach to establish </p>
<p>international support for military action, advising that for the five Permanent Members </p>
<p>(P5) and the majority of the UN Security Council to take the view that Iraq was in breach </p>
<p>of the cease-fire provisions of resolution 687 (1991):</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>they would need to be convinced that Iraq was in breach of its obligations </p>
<p>regarding WMD, and ballistic missiles. Such proof would need to be </p>
<p>incontrovertible and of large-scale activity. Current intelligence is insufficiently </p>
<p>robust to meet this criterion …; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… Iraq refused to admit UN inspectors after a clear ultimatum by the Security </p>
<p>Council; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UN inspectors were re-admitted to Iraq and found sufficient evidence of </p>
<p>WMD activity or were again expelled trying to do so.” </p>
<p><b>283.  Mr Straw stated that the WMD paper had to show that Iraq posed an </b></p>
<p><b>exceptional threat, and did not yet do so. </b></p>
<p><b>284. </b> The Cabinet Office ‘Options Paper’ and the WMD paper were sent to Mr Straw on </p>
<p>8 March.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> In relation to the draft paper on WMD, Mr Straw commented that it was:</p>
<p>“Good, but should not Iraq be first and also have more text? The paper has to show </p>
<p>why there is an exceptional threat from Iraq. It does not quite do this yet.”</p>

<p><b>JIC Current Intelligence Group Assessment, 15 March 2002</b></p>
<p><b>285.  A Current Intelligence Group (CIG) Assessment of the status of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>WMD programmes was produced to inform Mr Blair’s discussions with </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush. It stated that Iraq continued to pursue a policy of acquiring </b></p>
<p><b>WMD and their delivery means. </b></p>
<p><b>286. </b> A CIG Assessment, ‘The Status of Iraqi WMD Programmes’, was “approved on </p>
<p>behalf of the Committee [JIC]” by Mr Miller on 15 March 2002.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>287. </b> The Assessment stated that it had been commissioned by the FCO “to aid policy </p>
<p>discussions on Iraq”, but the minutes of the JIC of 6 March suggest it was produced </p>
<p>in response to a request from Sir David Manning specifically to inform Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>discussions with President Bush.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>288. </b> The Key Judgements in the Assessment were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq <b>retains up to 20 Al Hussein ballistic missiles </b>… The location and </p>
<p>condition of these is unknown, but there is sufficient engineering expertise to </p>
<p>make them operational.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has begun development of <b>medium range ballistic missiles over </b></p>
<p><b>1,000km</b> … but will <b>not be able to produce such a missile before 2007</b> </p>
<p>provided that sanctions remain effective.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq is <b>pursuing a nuclear weapons programme</b>. But <b>it will not be able to </b></p>
<p><b>indigenously produce a nuclear weapon while sanctions remain</b> in place, </p>
<p>unless suitable fissile material is purchased from abroad.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq <b>may retain some stocks of chemical agents</b>. Following a decision to do </p>
<p>so, Iraq could produce:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>significant quantities of <b>mustard within weeks</b>; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>significant quantities of <b>sarin and VX within months</b>, and in the case of </p>
<p>VX may already have done so.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq currently <b>has available</b>, either from pre-Gulf War stocks or more recent </p>
<p>production, a number of biological agents. Iraq could produce more of these </p>
<p><b>biological agents</b> within days.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A decision to begin CBW production would probably go undetected.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq can deliver CBW weapons by a variety of means including ballistic missiles. </p>
<p><b>Iraq’s CBW production capability is designed to survive</b> a military attack and </p>
<p>UN inspectors.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>289. </b> In the main text, but not in the Key Judgements, the Assessment warned that </p>
<p>the intelligence on Iraq’s WMD and ballistic missile programmes was “<b>sporadic and </b></p>
<p><b>patchy</b>”. It added, however, that Iraq was:</p>
<p>“… well practised in the art of deception, such as concealment and exaggeration. </p>
<p>A complete picture of the various programmes is therefore difficult. But it is clear </p>
<p>that Iraq continues to pursue a policy of acquiring WMD and their delivery means. </p>
<p>Intelligence indicates that planning to reconstitute some of its programmes began </p>
<p>in 1995. WMD programmes were then given a further boost with the withdrawal of </p>
<p>UNSCOM inspectors.” </p>
<p><b>290. </b> The detailed assessment of Iraq’s capabilities is set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>CIG Assessment, 15 March 2002: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Status of Iraqi WMD Programmes’</b></p>
<p><b>Ballistic missiles </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has rebuilt much of the military production infrastructures associated with the </p>
<p>missile programme and the few high profile sites targeted in Operation Desert Fox </p>
<p>in 1998.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“New infrastructure is being built with a particular focus on improving the support </p>
<p>to the solid propellant missile programme.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The <b>Al Samoud</b> missile had been “extensively flight-tested” and intelligence </p>
<p>indicated that Iraq had “produced at least 50 … including those test fired”. </p>
<p>Preparations were under way “to deploy some of these to military units”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has reportedly succeeded in developing a number of 200km variants of </p>
<p>Al Samoud although it is unclear if these are for operational use or research and </p>
<p>development for longer range systems.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A small number of transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) have been seen, </p>
<p>although others may exist.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Both the Al Samoud and the Al Hussein “could deliver basic chemical and </p>
<p>biological warheads”. There were “a limited number of launchers available” for </p>
<p>the missiles. “Identification and destruction by US aircraft of these missiles” was </p>
<p>“unlikely in the first few days of an attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “solid-propellant <b>Ababil-100</b> has also been tested and has reached ranges up </p>
<p>to 150 km. We judge that this system is likely to become operational as an SRBM </p>
<p>[short-range ballistic missile] within 2 years. It might enter service earlier as an </p>
<p>artillery rocket. Intelligence indicates that Iraq has plans to extend the range … </p>
<p>to 250km.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “seeking to develop new,<b> larger liquid and solid propellant missiles</b>, </p>
<p>contrary to UN limits”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Recent intelligence” indicated “personnel associated with the Al Samoud </p>
<p>programme” had “now been tasked to concentrate on designing liquid propellant </p>
<p>systems with ranges of 2,000-3,000km”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“New intelligence” indicated “the main focus may be on the development of a </p>
<p>SCUD derivative, which we judge has an intended range of around 1,200km”. </p>
<p>“Work on an engine for this system began in 1998, involving personnel who had </p>
<p>been reviewing the details of previous Al Hussein production since 1995, although </p>
<p>by the end of the year 2000 they were still experiencing technical problems. </p>
<p>Additional personnel were probably assigned to other parts of the programme </p>
<p>during 2000. A large static test stand capable of testing liquid propellant engines </p>
<p>bigger than the SCUD engine has been under construction since mid-2000, </p>
<p>probably in support of this programme. Work on larger motor cases for longer-</p>
<p>range solid propellant systems has been noted over the last 2-3 years.”</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“UN sanctions and the work of the inspectors”</b> had “caused significant </p>
<p>problems for Iraq’s missile industry in acquiring components and production </p>
<p>technology, in particular, for improving guidance and control systems and </p>
<p>therefore missile accuracy”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “actively seeking to procure material for its missile programme”. Imports </p>
<p>entered the country “mainly via Syria and the UAE, with some also coming </p>
<p>through Jordan and Turkey”; “In the last six months, Iraq’s foreign procurement </p>
<p>front companies have become bolder in approaching Western firms, […].” </p>
<p><b>Chemical warfare</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CIG continued “to judge that Iraq has an <b>offensive chemical warfare (CW) </b></p>
<p><b>programme</b>, although there is very little intelligence relating to it”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From the evidence available, the CIG believed that Iraq retained “some production </p>
<p>equipment, and some small stocks of … agent precursors, and may have hidden </p>
<p>small quantities of agents and weapons”. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“Anomalies in Iraqi declarations to UNSCOM”</b> suggested that “stocks could be </p>
<p>much larger”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence on production facilities was “scarce”; and “the reconstructed former </p>
<p>precursor … facility near Habbaniyah” was “insufficient to support large-scale CW </p>
<p>agent production. Other industrial chemical facilities could be used … but we have </p>
<p>no intelligence to suggest they are currently being used in that role.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence had “indicated an Iraqi interest in transportable production facilities for </p>
<p>chemical weapons, but these could produce only small amounts of agent” and the </p>
<p>CIG judged it “more likely that the mobile units are for filling munitions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could produce “<b>Significant quantities of mustard within weeks</b>, using </p>
<p>hidden stocks of precursors and with support from Iraq’s chemical industry”, and </p>
<p>“<b>Significant quantities of nerve agents within months</b>, mainly sarin and VX”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Production of significant quantities of nerve agent would be “heavily dependent on </p>
<p>hidden stocks of precursors, the size of which are unknown”. “There had been one </p>
<p>uncorroborated report that Iraq had filled some artillery rocket munitions with VX in </p>
<p>the period 1996-1998, and another that a team of chemists was formed in 1998 to </p>
<p>produce 5 tons of VX. The source had been told that this had been completed by </p>
<p>the end of 1998.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could also produce “incapacitants”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>Biological warfare</b></p>
<p>Work on a <b>biological warfare (BW) programme</b> had “continued throughout the period </p>
<p>of UNSCOM inspections” and intelligence indicated “that this programme continues. Key </p>
<p>figures from the pre-Gulf War programme are reported to be involved.” Research and </p>
<p>development was “assessed to continue under cover of a number of legitimate institutes </p>
<p>and possibly in a number of covert facilities”. </p>
<p>The CIG judged Iraq “could produce significant quantities of BW agents within days of a </p>
<p>decision to do so”.</p>
<p>There was:</p>
<p>“… no intelligence on any BW agent production facilities, but one source indicates </p>
<p>that Iraq may have developed <b>mobile production facilities</b>. A liaison source </p>
<p>reports that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the transportable production programme began in 1995;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>6 road-based facilities on trailers, and one rail based facility … were </p>
<p>constructed and by March 1999; three were operational;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the facilities were capable of making five different (unspecified/unknown) </p>
<p>biological agents. Between November 1998 and March 1999 20-30 tons of BW </p>
<p>agent was produced.”</p>
<p>The CIG commented:</p>
<p>“Though not corroborated, we judge the reporting is technically credible. Imagery </p>
<p>has yet to provide firm collateral but has identified a number of sites that could </p>
<p>be associated with this programme. The mobile production facilities have yet </p>
<p>to be identified.”</p>
<p>The CIG did not “know which types of agent are produced by these facilities” but </p>
<p>judged that “Iraq currently has available either from pre Gulf War stocks or more recent </p>
<p>production, anthrax spores, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and possibly plague”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “castor oil extraction plant at the former Habbaniyah chemical weapons site </p>
<p>may provide the base for producing ricin”, although there was “no evidence that </p>
<p>Iraq is currently doing so”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Reporting that Iraq has also conducted research on smallpox and other toxins </p>
<p>cannot be corroborated.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that Iraq was “self-sufficient in the production of biological weapons”.</p>
<p><b>Delivery means</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence indicated that Iraq had “command, control and logistical arrangements </p>
<p>in place” for the use of chemical weapons.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had a “variety of <b>delivery means</b> available for both chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons, some of which” were “very basic”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Because of the shortage of some platforms, such as aircraft and helicopters, we </p>
<p>judge that Iraq would not be able to conduct a sustained CBW campaign … even </p>
<p>if Iraq could produce enough CBW agents to do so. But a single major attack or a </p>
<p>number of small attacks would be feasible.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>Nuclear weapons programme</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CIG judged that Iraq “<b>does not possess a nuclear weapons capability</b>”, </p>
<p>and that: “Its programme was effectively dismantled by the IAEA”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although there was “very little intelligence”, the CIG continued to judge that Iraq </p>
<p>was “pursuing a nuclear weapons programme” which was assessed to be:</p>
<p>“… based on gas centrifuge <b>uranium enrichment</b> … the route Iraq was </p>
<p>following for producing fissile material prior to the Gulf War. Recent intelligence </p>
<p>indicates that nuclear scientists were recalled to work on a nuclear programme </p>
<p>in the autumn of 1998, but we do not know if large-scale development work </p>
<p>has yet recommenced. Procurement of dual use items over the last few </p>
<p>years could be used in a uranium enrichment programme. There have been </p>
<p>determined efforts to purchase high strength aluminium alloy …” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A shipment stopped in Jordan was inspected by the IAEA, “who accepted, that </p>
<p>with some modifications … would be suitable for use in centrifuges”. But there </p>
<p>was “no definitive intelligence that the aluminium was destined for a nuclear </p>
<p>programme”.</p>
<p>The CIG continued to judge that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“while sanctions remain effective, Iraq cannot indigenously develop and produce </p>
<p>nuclear weapons”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>if sanctions were removed or became ineffective, it would take at least </b></p>
<p><b>five years to produce a nuclear weapon</b>. This timescale would shorten if fissile </p>
<p>material was acquired from abroad.”</p>
<p>Iraq “was capable of producing an <b>improvised nuclear device</b>, but it lacks suitable fissile </p>
<p>material. Iraq has in the past explored the use of <b>radiological dispersal devices</b>, but </p>
<p>the design we have seen was not a credible weapon. There is no intelligence that Iraq is </p>
<p>interested in such devices.”</p>
<p><b>Dispersal of key equipment</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “temporarily dispersed key equipment from its missile production </p>
<p>facilities” following 11 September 2001, and was “likely to do so again” if it </p>
<p>believed an attack was “imminent”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Recent intelligence indicated that Qusay Hussein “has directed the Military </p>
<p>Industrialisation Commission to ensure that all sensitive weapons and chemical </p>
<p>technology was well hidden in case of further UN inspections, and that ‘destruction </p>
<p>committees’ have also been formed at suspect CW facilities”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dispersal made “the targeting of production equipment very difficult, but it also </p>
<p>prevents any surge in production”.</p>
<p><b>291.  The view that Iraq had used the period since the departure of the weapons </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors in December 1998 to seek to enhance its capabilities and was pursuing </b></p>
<p><b>a programme of concealment and deception was firmly embedded in UK thinking </b></p>
<p><b>by March 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>292.  There was also an impression that Iraq had a clear strategic intent to pursue </b></p>
<p><b>its prohibited programmes.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>293. </b> The Butler Report concluded that, for Iraq, readers of JIC Assessments would:</p>
<p>“… have had an impression of:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>The continuing clear strategic intent on the part of the Iraqi regime to </p>
<p>pursue its nuclear, biological, chemical and ballistic missile programmes.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>Continuing efforts by the Iraqi regime to sustain and where possible </p>
<p>develop its indigenous capabilities, including through procurement of </p>
<p>necessary material.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>The development, drawing on those capabilities, of Iraq’s ‘break out’ </p>
<p>potential in the chemical, biological and ballistic missile fields, coupled with </p>
<p>the proven ability to weaponise onto some delivery systems chemical and </p>
<p>biological agent.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>294. </b> The Inquiry concurs with that conclusion. </p>
<p><b>295. </b> Mr Dowse told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“If sanctions were to go … our assessment was that Saddam would very quickly aim </p>
<p>to rebuild his WMD programmes and then would pose a threat to his neighbours and </p>
<p>international peace.”</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Asked about the impact of international conventions, Mr Dowse added:</p>
<p>“… the view was that Iraq would be likely to ignore them. It had a long history of </p>
<p>cheating, attempting to hide, attempting to evade those controls. So I would say we </p>
<p>had very little doubt that Saddam would try to rebuild his programmes.” </p>
<p><b>297. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that, having got the capability, Iraq was capable of using </p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> Asked whether Iraq’s nuclear programme had been frozen, Mr Hoon responded:</p>
<p>“His [Saddam Hussein’s] nuclear programme had been frozen because of the </p>
<p>absence of fissile material, but I think there was sense that his efforts to develop </p>
<p>larger and longer-range missiles was part of an ambition to deliver a nuclear </p>
<p>weapon, if he could secure the fissile material.” </p>
<p><b>298. </b> Sir William Ehrman stated that, in relation to chemical and biological capabilities, </p>
<p>there were concerns about Iraq, “particularly through the spring and summer of </p>
<p>2002”, although much of the intelligence on which that was based was subsequently </p>
<p>withdrawn.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> Iraq’s previous actions in using chemical weapons and its breaches of </p>
<p>UN Security Council resolutions also made it a unique case.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>299. </b> Sir William subsequently stated that, by August 2002, concerns about the Libyan </p>
<p>nuclear programme and the Iranian and North Korean nuclear and missile programmes </p>
<p>were top priorities in respect of the UK’s counter-proliferation strategy; but so was Iraq:</p>
<p>“… because its WMD may be the exception to the rule that such programmes are </p>
<p>usually driven by defensive needs and, more importantly, are most likely to be </p>
<p>deployed against UK forces and those of our allies.”</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>300. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove, Chief of SIS from August 1999 to May 2004, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that, in spring 2002, Libya’s WMD programme was viewed as a more serious problem </p>
<p>than Iraq.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>301. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the stronger judgement in the 15 March 2002 </p>
<p>CIG Assessment about Iraq’s capability to produce biological agents “reflected a </p>
<p>better understanding of the mobile facilities … and the refurbishment of a former </p>
<p>production facility”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>302. </b> Sir John Scarlett confirmed that there had been a change in the assessment </p>
<p>between May 2001 and March 2002, as the influence of the reporting on mobile </p>
<p>laboratories had “built up”.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>303. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry that there was a “slight strengthening in March [2002] </p>
<p>of the judgement that BW production was likely to be continuing”.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> That was based </p>
<p>on a “slight accumulation of evidence” from reporting from a new source on a possible </p>
<p>laboratory and previous reporting in May 2001 from an SIS source on “anthrax </p>
<p>production in the early 1990s”, taken together with a “more thorough review of the </p>
<p>reporting on mobile laboratories”.</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Sir John Scarlett added that “it was judged by the experts to be technically credible </p>
<p>and indicated significant production in 1998 and 1999” and it had been “set against </p>
<p>separate reporting, not from the same source, on procurement of large amounts of </p>
<p>growth media, which at that stage was influential in the assessment”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> That was the </p>
<p>reason for the judgement that production of biological agent could begin within days, </p>
<p>rather than the previous assessment of weeks.</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>305.  The Butler Report also drew attention to uncertainties underlying the </b></p>
<p><b>judgements in the Assessment on Iraq’s:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>attempts to procure aluminium tubes;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>possession of plague; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>chemical weapons programme. </b></p>
<p><b>306. </b> The Butler Report stated that the Assessment had been “careful in its description” </p>
<p>of the purpose of Iraq’s attempts to procure aluminium tubes.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>307. </b> The Butler Report explained that the seizure of aluminium tubes in Jordan in 2001 </p>
<p>had not deterred Iraq from its efforts, and “By November 2001, there was intelligence </p>
<p>that their requirement had increased to 100,000 tubes”. It had, however, been “clear </p>
<p>from an early date” that, “on the basis of the specifications of the tubes” sought by Iraq, </p>
<p>“they would have required substantial re-engineering to make them suitable for gas </p>
<p>centrifuge use, including reducing them in length, and machining metal off the inside and </p>
<p>outside”. That was “paradoxical” given the “very fine tolerances” specified by Iraq.</p>
<p><b>308. </b> An alternative explanation for the purpose of the tubes had been available “from </p>
<p>the outset”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> Intelligence reporting in summer 2001 mentioned their potential use as </p>
<p>rocket motor casings. One report recorded that Iraq had been seeking tubes of the same </p>
<p>precise specification from Switzerland “probably for the Iraqi Air Force”. Other reports </p>
<p>“suggested possible conventional military uses”. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> Commenting on the inclusion of references to Iraq possibly possessing plague, </p>
<p>the Butler Report stated that they seemed to have been included in the list of Iraq’s </p>
<p>biological agents “mainly on the basis of reporting from a much earlier period”.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>judgement that Iraq could “possibly” produce plague within days “was stronger than </p>
<p>was justified by more recent intelligence”. A report issued in 1999 had “noted that the </p>
<p>informant was unaware of any Iraqi work on plague”. Comments on that report had </p>
<p>“concluded prudently: ‘We do not currently have any evidence that plague forms part of </p>
<p>the Iraq BW programme.’”</p>
<p><b>310. </b> The Butler Report added that “although little new intelligence was received, and </p>
<p>most of that was historical or unconvincing, plague continued to be mentioned in JIC </p>
<p>Assessments up to March 2003”. It concluded that those Assessments “reflected historic </p>
<p>evidence, and intelligence of dubious reliability, reinforced by suspicion of Iraq, rather </p>
<p>than up-to-date evidence”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>311. </b> The Butler Report also stated that the Assessment fairly reflected the intelligence </p>
<p>on Iraq’s chemical weapons programme, and that the word “may” had been used to </p>
<p>reflect previous intelligence reports on the production and weaponisation of chemical </p>
<p>agent.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> But it added, “we believe the position is best described by a DIS commentary </p>
<p>at the time”, which stated:</p>
<p>“Since 1998, there have been numerous claims that Iraq has continued to </p>
<p>weaponise agent, but much of the reporting has come from dubious sources and </p>
<p>that worth closer examination has lacked collateral and remains unsubstantiated.” </p>
<p><b>312. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry that there was little new intelligence on the chemical </p>
<p>warfare programme, “but one of the reports on ballistic missiles had carried at least the </p>
<p>implication that the person reporting believed that there was filling of missile warheads </p>
<p>with chemical agents”.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the May 2001 Assessment on chemical </p>
<p>agents had been “slightly stronger” than that of March 2002.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>314. </b> Mr Miller added that imagery had shown that plants which had been destroyed had </p>
<p>been “recreated”, “in some cases … with apparently surprising levels of security”.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> But </p>
<p>the reasons for the “less firm” assessment in March 2002 were “no longer completely </p>
<p>clear”. His view was that:</p>
<p>“… it reflected the judgement of the particular group of experts who had been </p>
<p>convened on each occasion to look at the evidence. They reached slightly different </p>
<p>conclusions on the weight to attach to it.” </p>
<p><b>315. </b> Sir John Scarlett also drew attention to the assessment of Iraq’s ability to conceal </p>
<p>and disperse its weaponry and that there was:</p>
<p>“… intelligence to show … that thinking was being given to that and orders had </p>
<p>gone out accordingly and there had been a temporary dispersal of what was called </p>
<p>‘sensitive equipment’ after 9/11.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Sir John added: “It was a firm underlying judgement that Iraq was pushing where </p>
<p>it could, but there was little detailed intelligence on nuclear and chemical programmes.” </p>
<p>That had been “set against the underlying judgements [in earlier Assessments] on </p>
<p>command and control and logistical support, weaponisation”. But it did not answer </p>
<p>the questions of what chemical or biological agents Iraq currently possessed or </p>
<p>was producing.</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>73</p>
<p><b>Draft ‘WMD Programmes of Concern’ paper, 15 March 2002</b></p>
<p><b>317.  The revised draft of the paper for publication on WMD programmes of </b></p>
<p><b>concern sent to No.10 on 15 March incorporated new material strengthening the </b></p>
<p><b>sections on Iraq’s capabilities, including highlighting some unique features in </b></p>
<p><b>relation to Iraq’s violation of Security Council resolutions and Saddam Hussein’s </b></p>
<p><b>use of CW agents against his own people. </b></p>
<p><b>318.  The draft included a diagram illustrating the impact of a nuclear warhead </b></p>
<p><b>with a 20 kiloton yield exploding over London, despite the fact that Iraq did not </b></p>
<p><b>have such a capability and there was no indication that Iraq would target the UK. </b></p>
<p><b>319. </b> In response to a request from Sir David Manning to look hard at the facts on Iraq, </p>
<p>which would come in for tough scrutiny, particularly about the missile programmes, </p>
<p>Mr Miller advised on 11 March that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… there is not much new intelligence in the paper. It is open to the question: so </p>
<p>what has changed?” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Campbell had had “a first run through the draft” that morning, and thought it </p>
<p>was on “the right lines” but “suggested a number of areas where more details </p>
<p>could be included”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Campbell had “also commissioned an unclassified paper on the world trade </p>
<p>in WMD”.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>320. </b> Mr Scarlett sent what was described as a “final draft” of the paper on WMD </p>
<p>programmes of concern to senior officials in the FCO, the MOD and the intelligence </p>
<p>agencies, on 13 March.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>321. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that the draft further reflected the views of No.10 on an earlier </p>
<p>version, and that it was “broadly content with the thrust of the paper”. </p>
<p><b>322. </b> Mr Scarlett drew attention to the fact that there were “still some reservations on </p>
<p>a number of key points”, including going further than before in statements on Iran and </p>
<p>Libya’s nuclear programmes.</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Mr Scarlett sought final comments before a meeting the following day “to resolve </p>
<p>any outstanding issues”. </p>
<p><b>324. </b> The key changes to the draft paper submitted on 6 March were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Introduction, Background and Aim were largely unchanged although a </p>
<p>sentence was added to the last stating that the paper focused “on four countries, </p>
<p>which we judge pose a potential threat to our interests”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Summary of Iraq’s capabilities had been revised to focus first on Iraq’s </p>
<p>ballistic missiles, including the addition of a statement that Iraq retained “some </p>
<p>prohibited missile systems”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A statement that Al Qaida would “continue with its efforts to acquire WMD and </p>
<p>will use them if successful” was added to the Summary. </p>
<p><b>325. </b>  In the detailed section on Iraq, the key changes were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>References to relevant UN resolutions and statements that Iraq was in breach of </p>
<p>those resolutions and the NPT were added and emphasised throughout the text.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Addition of text stating that the sanctions regime had “impeded” Iraq’s efforts </p>
<p>to reconstitute its capabilities, but had “not halted them. Much of Iraq’s missile </p>
<p>infrastructure has been rebuilt; the nuclear weapons programme is been [sic] </p>
<p>reconstituted; and Iraq continues to have the capability to produce chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons, and may already have done so.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The section on ballistic missiles was strengthened by the addition of further </p>
<p>details, including:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Iraq had chemical and biological warheads available in 1991, but did not </p>
<p>use them.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Recent evidence suggested that Iraq had succeeded in “reverse” </p>
<p>engineering SCUD missile engines, which meant it could build new </p>
<p>missiles.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Some Al Hussein missiles “could be available for use”, and although they </p>
<p>were “not very accurate” they were “still an effective system which could be </p>
<p>used with a conventional, chemical or biological warhead”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Reporting had recently confirmed that Iraq’s priority was “to develop </p>
<p>longer-range missile systems, which we judge are likely to have ranges </p>
<p>over 1,000km”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Removal of the reference to Iraq working on missile systems “with ranges </p>
<p>up to 2,000km”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The nuclear section was strengthened by the addition of text on:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Iraq’s aim before the Gulf Conflict to produce a weapon with a 20 kiloton </p>
<p>yield, “ultimately” for delivery in a ballistic missile warhead.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Details of the impact of such a weapon if it was used over London. </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Intelligence in the last year which “indicated” that specialists were recalled </p>
<p>to work on the nuclear programme “in the autumn of 1998”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Iraq exploration of the use of radiological dispersal devices before the </p>
<p>Gulf Conflict, but there was “no evidence that they have maintained </p>
<p>this interest”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Detailed drafting changes to the text on chemical and biological weapons, </p>
<p>including that Iraq’s modification of the L-29 trainer was judged to be “designed </p>
<p>for the delivery of chemical and biological agents”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Comments described as the “advice of DIS desk officers rather than the official </p>
<p>DIS position”, were sent to the Assessments Staff in advance of Mr Scarlett’s meeting, </p>
<p>including that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had not admitted “large-scale” production of VX agent until 1995; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was insufficient intelligence to support a statement that the modification of </p>
<p>the L-29 (jet trainer aircraft) was designed to disperse chemical and biological </p>
<p>agents.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>327. </b> A record of Mr Scarlett’s meeting produced by a DIS participant stated that </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s comment, that he had been “left with the conclusion that there is nothing </p>
<p>exceptional regarding Iraq”, was “seen as a fair assessment”.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> That was “to </p>
<p>be considered further”. The drafting comments on Iraq offered in the email from </p>
<p>AM French’s office had been accepted. </p>
<p><b>328. </b> The DIS document which appears to have provided the basis for the </p>
<p>DIS comments sent to the Assessments Staff on 14 March, contained one additional </p>
<p>point on Iraq questioning the categorical statement in the Summary section of the draft </p>
<p>that Iraq had a chemical and biological weapons capability.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> The author stated that that </p>
<p>was historically correct, but:</p>
<p>“… we are currently unsure as to Iraq[’s] absolute capability. We feel there may be </p>
<p>difficulty supporting this in the public domain. We should prefer a bullet point similar </p>
<p>to … Iran.”</p>
<p><b>329. </b> The relevant statement on Iran was that:</p>
<p>“Iran has a chemical weapons programme and is capable of producing a wide range </p>
<p>of chemical weapons. Iran is also capable of producing biological agents.”</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The UK Government has been unable to locate a CO record of Mr Scarlett’s </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Addressing points raised by policy departments, including in relation to Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the context of Mr Straw’s comment that an earlier draft did not demonstrate </p>
<p>why Iraq posed a greater threat than other countries of concern, the new draft </p>
<p>highlighted “some unique features” in relation to Iraq’s violation of Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions and Saddam Hussein’s use of CW agents against his </p>
<p>own people.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir David might wish to consider whether the paper could achieve more impact </p>
<p>if it “only covered Iraq”: “This would have the benefit of obscuring the fact that in </p>
<p>terms of WMD, Iraq is not that exceptional. But it would diminish the impact of </p>
<p>the paper in terms of the wider problem of WMD proliferation.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “potential for some awkwardness” because the briefing document </p>
<p>circulated to the PLP in early March stated that Iraq could have nuclear weapons </p>
<p>in five years if its programmes remained unchecked. </p>
<p><b>333. </b> Mr Scarlett also drew attention to the implications of making public for the first time </p>
<p>the UK’s assessments of Iran and Libya’s nuclear and chemical programmes, and the </p>
<p>omission of Syria because it was “not expected to develop capabilities threatening to </p>
<p>western interests (no long-range missiles)” and it was “not clear” if it was “pursuing a </p>
<p>nuclear programme”.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> Mr Scarlett suggested that Sir David might want to consider a wider discussion </p>
<p>of the issues raised, and advised that it would be important to set the paper “in a wider </p>
<p>policy context” and prepare defensive press material before it was released. </p>
<p><b>335. </b> Mr Scarlett also mentioned a separate paper, on the world trade in WMD </p>
<p>commissioned by Mr Campbell, which “might be more effective as an appendix” to </p>
<p>the paper on WMD programmes of concern. That could be considered when a more </p>
<p>developed text was available. </p>
<p><b>336. </b> There is no evidence that Sir David sought a wider discussion.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Changes to the draft included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A revision to the Aim to state that the paper focused “on four countries, whose </p>
<p>activities are assessed to pose a direct threat to our interests”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s “demonstrated readiness to deploy extensively WMD in the </p>
<p>form of chemical weapons both against his neighbours and his own population” </p>
<p>before the Gulf Conflict.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reference to Iraq’s failure to comply with UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The statement that recent evidence indicated Iraq had succeeded in reverse </p>
<p>engineering SCUD missiles was amended to “may have succeeded”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Addition of a reference to the IAEA having dismantled Iraq’s nuclear weapons </p>
<p>infrastructure, and the removal of a reference to a judgement that Iraq still </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Removal of the reference to Iraq’s past exploration into the use of radiological </p>
<p>dispersal devices.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The statement “We judge that Iraq has a covert chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons programme …” was changed to: “We assess that …”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Decision to produce a dossier focused on Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>Proposal for a media strategy to prepare opinion for possible </b></p>
<p><b>military action</b></p>
<p><b>339.  The FCO News Department prepared a draft media strategy suggesting that </b></p>
<p><b>momentum could be built by feeding the media information on WMD and ensuring </b></p>
<p><b>that, if military action became necessary, it would be clear that other means had </b></p>
<p><b>been exhausted and it was Saddam Hussein who was at fault.</b></p>
<p><b>340.  It is not clear what prompted this advice or how authoritatively it represented </b></p>
<p><b>the FCO position at the time. But it does provide an indication of the thinking in </b></p>
<p><b>the FCO News Department about the prospect of military action. It was sent to </b></p>
<p><b>Ministers and senior officials in the FCO, and to Mr Campbell in No.10.</b></p>
<p><b>341. </b> As part of the wider policy debate on Iraq, which is addressed in Section 3.2, </p>
<p>Mr Blair and Mr Straw were, by mid-March, both addressing the need for an effective </p>
<p>message about the specific threat posed by Iraq to underpin the wider strategy.</p>
<p><b>342. </b> Mr John Williams, Head of the FCO News Department, sent Mr Straw’s Private </p>
<p>Office advice on a media strategy on 11 March, stating: </p>
<p>“The process of preparing media and public opinion for possible action on Iraq is </p>
<p>under way … </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister’s interviews in Australia and the Foreign Secretary’s piece in </p>
<p><i>The Times</i> have established a solid base from which to work. The media has taken </p>
<p>the point and is eager for detail. There is high interest in evidence being compiled for </p>
<p>the dossier with [sic] the UK will share with the US.</p>
<p>“We should exploit this interest by feeding newspapers and broadcasters with </p>
<p>information on WMD, diversion of imports for military use, and human rights abuse: </p>

<p>Letter McDonald to Manning, 15 March 2002, ‘Iraq’ attaching Note, ‘Iraq: Weapons Inspectors’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>all of it presented as evidence from the Government’s forthcoming dossier. By doing </p>
<p>so, we can build momentum.”</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>343. </b> Mr Williams identified the need to “encourage support from sympathetic </p>
<p>newspapers and carry the argument to those likely to criticise our policy”. Journalists </p>
<p>who were “too easily inclined to discount the threat Saddam poses” should be “forced by </p>
<p>the weight of facts” to justify their position. The exercise:</p>
<p>“… should be part of a big effort to convey more clearly than we have before a sense </p>
<p>that we are proposing a peaceful means of dealing with the problem through the UN, </p>
<p>while Saddam is deliberately making a peaceful solution impossible. We have to </p>
<p>stop his propagandists portraying him as the victim, rather than the villain. If action </p>
<p>becomes necessary, it must be clear to all but a minority in [the] media and public </p>
<p>opinion that we have exhausted all other means, and that Saddam is at fault.” </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Mr Williams also suggested the need to co-ordinate information and activity </p>
<p>between London and Washington and consideration of using the Communications and </p>
<p>Information Centre (CIC).</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Williams provided a more detailed media strategy, “agreed with Middle East </p>
<p>Command [in the FCO] and No.10 Press Office”, which had been prepared by one of his </p>
<p>staff and was “designed to co-ordinate and pace our efforts for maximum impact”. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> The objectives of the strategy were identified as: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>convincing people of “the real threat to their safety and security” from Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD programmes; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demonstrating that Iraq was “in breach of its international obligations to </p>
<p>co-operate with the UN”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparing “public opinion in Britain and abroad … for possible military action”; </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>349. </b> Mr Williams told the Inquiry that he could “recall feeling it necessary” to produce </p>
<p>the note, “though not what internal or external event prompted this”, and that “clearly </p>
<p>there was a heightened activity in Whitehall at the time”.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>350. </b>  The proposals were discussed in a meeting held by Mr Straw on 18 March. That is </p>
<p>addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>351.  Mr Blair concluded on 17 March that the papers he had been given on Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>did not constitute a properly worked out strategy and that he would need to </b></p>
<p><b>provide the US with a far more intelligent and detailed analysis of a game plan if </b></p>
<p><b>the UK was to influence its decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>352.  That included a need to “re-order our story and message” to address the </b></p>
<p><b>limited support for a policy of regime change.</b></p>
<p><b>353. </b> In a minute to Mr Jonathan Powell, his Chief of Staff, on 17 March, Mr Blair noted </p>
<p>the absence of a “proper worked-out strategy” on Iraq, and the need to provide the US </p>
<p>“with a far more intelligent and detailed analysis of a game plan”.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>354. </b> Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“The persuasion job on this seems very tough. My own side are worried. Public </p>
<p>opinion is fragile. International opinion – as I found at the EU – is pretty sceptical. </p>
<p>“Yet from a centre-left perspective, the case should be obvious …”</p>
<p><b>355. </b> Mr Blair acknowledged that “the immediate WMD problems don’t seem obviously </p>
<p>worse than 3 years ago”. He concluded: “So we have to re-order our story and message. </p>
<p>Increasingly I think [these] should be about the nature of the regime.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>356. </b> Asked to explain the thinking in his minute, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, in relation </p>
<p>to WMD, the:</p>
<p>“… question was about the changed assessment of the risk and the difficulty of </p>
<p>making the case that Saddam Hussein posed a threat.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>359. </b> Mr Straw held a meeting to discuss Iraq on 18 March, addressing preparations for </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s visit to the US, the current discussions between Iraq and the UN and public </p>
<p>and Parliamentary handling.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> The last item comprised:</p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>Media strategy … and the next steps in the run-up to Crawford.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Handling of paper for public use on WMD programmes of concern.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Ensuring co-ordination.” </p>
<p><b>360. </b> After the meeting, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary recorded in relation to the public </p>
<p>presentation of WMD:</p>
<p>“[T]he JIC paper for publication should be solely about Iraq. The Foreign Secretary </p>
<p>has discussed this with Alastair Campbell, who agreed. The Foreign Secretary </p>
<p>suggests the paper resemble Michael Williams’ paper for the PLP, with the meat of </p>
<p>the JIC material inserted, so that it covers the range of concerns about Iraq but also </p>
<p>draws explicitly on intelligence material. He is content, thereafter, for a more general </p>
<p>paper on WMD, including other countries programmes, to be issued.”</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Mr Straw would write to Mr Blair “to flag up the main issues for Crawford, including </p>
<p>a media strategy beforehand”.</p>
<p><b>362. </b> Mr Straw would be:</p>
<p>“… willing to brief the Diplomatic Correspondents and the Muslim media on Iraq, </p>
<p>perhaps launching the JIC paper. Overall, we should continue to highlight the </p>
<p>WMD threat, increase the profile of the UN angle and play down the prospect for </p>
<p>military action.” </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Mr Straw agreed that the FCO News Department/CIC should be reinforced with </p>
<p>expertise on Iraq. </p>
<p><b>364. </b> Mr Straw’s request for advice on a media strategy and the legal issues is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 3.2.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Campbell wrote to Mr Scarlett, Mr Powell, Sir David Manning and others on </p>
<p>19 March, stating that he had discussed the draft with Mr Straw and others and:</p>
<p>“The general view, including Jack’s, is that with such a focus on the public debate on </p>
<p>Iraq at the moment, we may be trying to do too much by looking at Iran and North </p>
<p>Korea too.”</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Straw was making a speech to the Foreign Policy </p>
<p>Centre on 25 March and “was wondering” whether an “Iraq only version” of the </p>

<p>document could be published. Mr Straw was also thinking of making a statement to </p>
<p>Parliament. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Campbell asked: “Do you and copy recipients agree with this approach? </p>
<p>Is it doable?” </p>
<p><b>368. </b> The JIC was informed on 20 March that an unclassified paper on Iraq’s weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction was “due to be made public on 25 March, following detailed discussion </p>
<p>with interested parties”.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>369. </b> The minutes of the JIC meeting record that: </p>
<p>“In a short discussion, the main point made was that the production of this document </p>
<p>followed in the wake of similar exercises during the Kosovo conflict and after </p>
<p>the events of 11 September. On each occasion there had been a need to use </p>
<p>secret intelligence for public consumption, in this current case because of policy </p>
<p>imperatives, but each case needed to be taken on its merits. In some circumstances </p>
<p>it would be difficult to meet the political need for material to use in public.”</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Concern was expressed about the potential to undermine the Government’s </p>
<p>policy of not commenting on intelligence matters, which might merit further discussion </p>
<p>“at some stage”.</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Sir David Manning sought Mr Blair’s views on the publication of the document, </p>
<p>which gave details of Saddam Hussein’s WMD programmes “drawn from intelligence, </p>
<p>providing as much detail as we can safely reveal”, on 20 March.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> Mr Campbell, </p>
<p>Mr Powell, Mr Scarlett and he had discussed the handling of the paper and concluded </p>
<p>that it should be issued “soon”. A speech or statement by Mr Straw on 25 March, which </p>
<p>described “a regime which terrorises its own people and is determined to acquire WMD </p>
<p>to terrorise its neighbours … would be the cue for placing” the paper “in the Library of </p>
<p>the House, and for subsequent briefing of the media”.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Sir David concluded:</p>
<p>“We discussed whether we should delay until after you have been to Crawford. </p>
<p>On balance we concluded it would serve our purpose better to release the </p>
<p>material now to avoid charges that this was an exercise that we had undertaken </p>
<p>at Bush’s prompting.</p>
<p>“Are you content for us to go ahead on this basis?”</p>
<p><b>373. </b> In a manuscript postscript, Sir David added that the proposal had been discussed </p>
<p>with Mr Straw, who was happy but preferred a speech in the House to a statement. </p>

<p><b>374. </b> There is no indication in the No.10 papers sent to the Inquiry of a response </p>
<p>from Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Sir David Manning wrote on 2 April: “Not to issue at present.”</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>376.  A revised draft paper on Iraqi WMD programmes was produced on 20 March, </b></p>
<p><b>explicitly stating that Iraq was in breach of UN Security Council resolutions and </b></p>
<p><b>giving more prominence to its strategies for concealment.</b></p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Miller sent the draft paper, which was “very much as you have seen it before”, </p>
<p>to the US Embassy asking for “final comments”.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>378. </b>  Mr Miller also wrote to Sir Richard Dearlove, Sir Francis Richards (Director </p>
<p>of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)) and AM French with a </p>
<p>similar request.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>379. </b> The Introduction of the draft paper had been revised to place the UK’s concerns </p>
<p>in the context of the failure of a few countries to sign the NPT, the CWC and BTWC or a </p>
<p>decision, if they had signed, “to break them”.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>380. </b> The Introduction focused on Iraq’s failure to comply with the NPT, its previous use </p>
<p>of chemical weapons, and its failure to comply with relevant UN resolutions adopted </p>
<p>since the 1991 Gulf Conflict. It also stated:</p>
<p>“The International Community has repeatedly sought to disrupt Iraq’s efforts to </p>
<p>acquire WMD. On each occasion Saddam has sought to rebuild his capabilities. </p>
<p>His efforts are making progress. The Government monitors these efforts very </p>
<p>closely. This paper sets out what the Government is able to say about them.” </p>
<p><b>381. </b> The Introduction remained unchanged in all subsequent versions of the document </p>
<p>produced before September.</p>
<p><b>382. </b> Other changes in the draft paper included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An acknowledgement that Iraq’s nuclear weapons infrastructure had been </p>
<p>dismantled by the IAEA, but the addition of a judgement that Iraq was “still </p>
<p>working to achieve a nuclear weapons capability”. That was in breach of its NPT </p>
<p>and IAEA obligations, and resolution 687 (1991). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A reference to Iraq’s obligation under resolution 707 (1991) to “cease all nuclear </p>
<p>activities of any kind other than the civil use of isotopes”.</p>

<p>Mr Sebastian Wood, Counsellor for External Affairs at the British Embassy Washington, </p>

<p>other evidence of our commitment to a wide range of non/counter-proliferation tools”.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>384. </b> In response to receiving a copy of the draft text on Iraq only, Mr Wood wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Ricketts:</p>
<p>“Firstly, if the primary aim of this exercise is to build public understanding of and </p>
<p>support for decisive action to prevent Saddam’s further acquisition of WMD, we </p>
<p>think that whatever is published should spotlight the nexus between State sponsors </p>
<p>of terrorism and WMD, and the associated risk that State-developed WMD </p>
<p>technology is made available to terrorists who would not hesitate to use it: the [US] </p>
<p>Administration have repeatedly stated that this is their number one concern, and </p>
<p>focusing the dossier on this risk would bring out more vividly the threat to the UK. </p>
<p>Neither does that at the moment.”</p>
<p>169</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Wood questioned the urgency in producing the document and recommended </p>
<p>that US policy officials, including Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National </p>
<p>Security Advisor, should be given a chance to comment on the tactics and timing of </p>
<p>publication: “We would not want them to think we are bouncing them on such a politically </p>

<p>defensive about, but attempts to claim otherwise publicly will increase scepticism </p>
<p>about our case. I am relieved that you decided to postpone publication of the </p>
<p>unclassified document. My meeting yesterday showed there is more work to do to </p>
<p>ensure that the figures are accurate, and consistent with those of the US. But even </p>
<p>the best survey of Iraq’s WMD programmes will not show much advance in recent </p>

<p><b>393. </b> Mr Ricketts added:</p>
<p>“US scrambling to establish a link between Iraq and Al Qaida is so far frankly </p>
<p>unconvincing. To get public and Parliamentary support for military operations we </p>
<p>have to be convincing that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the threat is so serious/imminent that it is worth sending our troops to die for;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it is qualitatively different from the threat posed by other proliferators who are </p>
<p>closer to achieving nuclear capability (including Iran). </p>
<p>“We can make the case on qualitative difference (only Iraq has attacked a </p>
<p>neighbour, used CW and fired missiles against Israel). But the overall strategy needs </p>
<p>to include re-doubled efforts to tackle other proliferators … in other ways … But we </p>
<p>are still left with a problem of bringing public opinion to accept the imminence of a </p>
<p>threat from Iraq. This is something the Prime Minister and President need to have a </p>

<p><b>396. </b> Mr Ricketts added that he had asked No.10 to consider asking the Cabinet Office </p>

<p>“There was a concentration on ensuring that we produced a document which would </p>
<p>make an impact. I therefore had to include as much fresh material as possible. </p>
<p>But throughout the process we were clear that the material had to be factually </p>
<p>accurate and as comprehensive as possible. We drew from a range of sources, both </p>
<p>open and classified, including intelligence material. I relied on the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>Assessments Staff and other representatives of the intelligence community to advise </p>
<p>on the accuracy of the material which they were providing and the benefits and risks </p>
<p>of using intelligence material in a public document.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Mr McKane told the Inquiry that there was a debate in Whitehall about whether </p>

<p>176</p>

<p><b>Mr Hoon emphasised the importance of a wider counter-proliferation </b></p>

<p><b>bigger problem for the UK than Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Hoon also stated that a number of issues would need to be addressed </b></p>
<p><b>before forces were committed to military action, including the need for a </b></p>

<p><b>407. </b> In relation to the threat posed by Iraq’s WMD, Mr Hoon wrote:</p>
<p>“The key strategic problem is the spread of WMD – of which Saddam is only one </p>
<p>unpleasant dimension. A more active counter-proliferation strategy is required for the </p>
<p>region as a whole (for example any Iraqi government will seek WMD if Iran is getting </p>
<p>them so our strategy must cover both) … </p>
<p>“… In objective terms, Iran may be the greater problem for the UK … Ironically, </p>
<p>we have Saddam Hussein bound into an established control mechanism. There is </p>
<p>some substance in the US view that he as an individual is at the root of the WMD </p>

<p><b>408. </b> Mr Hoon also proposed that Mr Blair might raise with President Bush “the need for </p>
<p>a comprehensive public handling strategy, so that we can explain convincingly why we </p>
<p>need to take such drastic action against Iraq’s WMD now”.</p>
<p><b>409.  Mr Straw pointed out that the evidence did not explain why the threat from </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq would justify military action. </b></p>
<p><b>410. </b> On 25 March, Mr Straw sent a personal minute to Mr Blair on the way ahead </p>
<p>on Iraq. </p>
<p><b>411. </b> In relation to the draft document for publication, Mr Straw wrote that making the </p>
<p>case that “Saddam and the Iraq regime are bad” was “easy”, but there were four areas </p>
<p>where there was “a long way to go to convince” the PLP, including about “the scale of </p>
<p>the threat from Iraq and why this has got worse recently” and “what distinguishes the </p>
<p>Iraqi threat from that of eg Iran and North Korea so as to justify military action”.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Straw advised that the Iraqi regime posed “a most serious threat to its </p>
<p>neighbours, and therefore to international security” but, from “the documents so far </p>
<p>presented it has been hard to glean whether the threat from Iraq is so significantly </p>
<p>different” as to justify military action. There was: </p>
<p>“… no credible evidence to link Iraq with UBL and Al Qaida … </p>
<p>“… Objectively, the threat from Iraq has not worsened as a result of 11 September. </p>
<p>What has, however, changed is the tolerance of the international community …”</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Addressing the difference between Iraq, Iran and North Korea, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“By linking these countries together in his ‘axis of evil’ speech, President Bush </p>
<p>implied an identity between them not only in terms of their threat, but also in terms of </p>
<p>the action necessary to deal with the threat. A lot of work will now need to be done </p>
<p>to delink the three, and to show why military action against Iraq is so much more </p>
<p>justified than against Iran and North Korea. The heart of this case – that Iraq poses a </p>
<p>unique and present danger – rests on the fact that it:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>invaded a neighbour;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>has used WMD, and would use them again;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>is in breach of nine UNSCRs.”</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Following discussions in Washington, Mr Webb discussed the time Iraq would </p>
<p>need to acquire a nuclear weapon with Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence </p>
<p>Staff (CDS), and AM French on 20 March.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>416. </b> A DIS paper, “What does Iraq need to do to get the bomb quickly?” was produced </p>
<p>later that day.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Referring to the Assessment of 15 March, the DIS stated: </p>
<p>“Although there is very little intelligence, the JIC judges that Iraq is still pursuing a </p>
<p>nuclear weapons programme. Intelligence indicates that scientists were recalled to </p>
<p>work on a nuclear weapons programme in the autumn of 1998, but it is not known </p>
<p>if large scale development work has yet recommenced. Procurement of dual use </p>
<p>items over the last few years could be used in a uranium enrichment programme. </p>
<p>But we have no definitive intelligence that such items are intended for a nuclear </p>
<p>programme.”</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Addressing the question “What does Iraq have now?”, the DIS stated that the </p>
<p>Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) had concluded that Iraq had “made significant </p>
<p>progress in designing a nuclear device” before 1991:</p>
<p>“Many aspects of a simple design had been studied, although the high explosives </p>
<p>needed to detonate the device had not been fully developed. More sophisticated </p>
<p>concepts were being considered to produce a smaller and lighter device, capable of </p>
<p>missile delivery, but it is unlikely that much progress has been made … Iraq will have </p>
<p>retained <b>documents, drawings and expertise</b>.</p>
<p>“… Iraq still needed to complete aspects of its design and, in particular, to validate </p>
<p>the high explosives system. It is unlikely that much of this would have been done </p>
<p>before IAEA inspectors left in December 1998 for fear of detection. However, if all </p>
<p>the key scientists had been recalled … they could have reconstituted the programme </p>
<p>and <b>further developed warhead designs</b> since then. This would not necessarily </p>
<p>have been detected by intelligence.</p>
<p>“Iraq also has some possible <b>platforms to deliver</b> a suitable nuclear device. </p>
<p>Its Russian made jet aircraft … could probably be adapted [to] carry a simple </p>
<p>nuclear bomb … Any former SCUD missiles that could be assembled could take </p>
<p>a more sophisticated device. However, the remaining … Al Hussein missiles </p>
<p>would not be suitable.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>419. </b> Addressing the question “What would Iraq need?”, the DIS stated:</p>
<p>“Iraq does not have the <b>fissile material</b> to make a weapon. To rebuild its uranium </p>
<p>enrichment programme would take years and require extensive foreign procurement, </p>
<p>which would not be possible with effective sanctions in place. To make a weapon </p>
<p>quickly, Iraq would need Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) from the ‘black market’ </p>
<p>(eg stolen from Russia). It would be credible but very difficult for Iraq to do this. We </p>
<p>have no good evidence of Iraq ever acquiring any such material.</p>
<p>“Iraq cannot make the crucial <b>neutron initiator</b> for the device. Iraq needs a nuclear </p>
<p>reactor to make a key material in the original unfinished design: it has not had a[n] </p>
<p>operable reactor since 1991. Iraq would need to develop or buy a completely new </p>
<p>initiator system [from abroad]. Even if it acquired [a] system … Iraq would have to </p>
<p>develop the theory and practicalities of how to use such a component. Iraq could </p>
<p>only do this quickly with outside expertise.</p>
<p>“Iraq’s goal has been to produce a missile warhead. If it had the necessary </p>
<p>components and fissile material, Iraq could complete its former simple warhead </p>
<p>design for <b>air delivery</b> within a year. However a <b>missile warhead</b> would require </p>
<p>a more sophisticated design concept which would take at least two years longer. </p>
<p>These timescales could only be shortened with outside assistance.”</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Addressing Iraq’s ability to produce an improvised nuclear device (IND), the DIS </p>
<p>stated that: “If Iraq could acquire reactor-grade plutonium on the ‘black market’ it could </p>
<p>assemble a crude nuclear weapon.” That would be “large and unreliable” and have to </p>
<p>be delivered by “unconventional means (eg a lorry)”. There was, however, “no evidence” </p>
<p>that Iraq had sought such material.</p>
<p><b>421. </b> The DIS concluded:</p>
<p>“(a)  Iraq does not have any nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>(b)  Iraq has much of the design technology for a simple nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>(c)  It cannot make the fissile material or a neutron initiator for a weapon.</p>
<p>(d)  To make a nuclear weapon quickly, Iraq would have to acquire fissile material </p>
<p>and a weaponised neutron initiator system, together with foreign expert assistance.</p>
<p>(e)  If Iraq could acquire sufficient low-grade plutonium from power reactor </p>
<p>fuel it could make a crude IND, but would need to use risky unconventional </p>
<p>delivery means.”</p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>422. </b>  AM French commented that the views Mr Webb had heard in the Pentagon were </p>
<p>“not held unanimously in Washington”, and the DIS analysis was supported by their </p>
<p>“US counterparts”:</p>
<p>“If you take a ‘best case’ scientific and technical approach to this issue, rather than </p>
<p>using intelligence, then we judge that Iraq could probably complete its former simple </p>
<p>warhead design for air delivery within about a year.”</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>423. </b> On 22 March, Mr Webb asked Dr Paul Roper, Director Strategic Technology, for:</p>
<p>“… a second opinion, in particular on how quickly and under what circumstances </p>
<p>Iraq might acquire a deployable nuclear capability. There is a range of opinions on </p>
<p>this, even within the US Administration.”</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Mr Webb asked for a response by 8 April.</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Dr Roper responded that he agreed with the advice in the DIS paper, which was “a </p>
<p>‘best guess’ broad based scientific judgement” in circumstances where hard intelligence </p>
<p>was “a little thin on the ground”. He added that it was “very important to distinguish” </p>
<p>between those two cases.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>426. </b> Dr Roper wrote that it was:</p>
<p>“… hard to believe that Iraq had covertly established a domestic source [of fissile </p>
<p>material] given the relatively large signatures of the necessary facilities and it would </p>
<p>almost certainly take a few years from start up to acquire enough material.” </p>
<p><b>427. </b> Dr Roper’s view was that the likelihood of Iraq acquiring fissile material from </p>
<p>abroad was “low”, but that was “purely an intelligence matter” not a scientific judgement. </p>
<p><b>428. </b> Dr Roper set out other components that would be required for a nuclear weapon </p>
<p>or device, concluding that even if “against all the odds” Iraq acquired those components </p>
<p>from a third party: “The nuclear component would have to be fabricated and integrated </p>
<p>with the explosives system and the firing electronics and incorporated in a bomb case.” </p>
<p>That would “take some time and the one year ‘guesstimate’ is reasonable”. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> Dr Roper pointed out that work could be carried out in advance of the acquisition </p>
<p>of fissile material. In that case “it might take only a few weeks to complete assembly” </p>
<p>once fissile material was obtained. Whether such activity would be detected was an </p>
<p>“intelligence judgement”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>430. </b> Dr Roper concluded:</p>
<p>“A more advanced design suitable for deployment on a missile would almost </p>
<p>certainly involve more development work and explosive trials. I have no feel for </p>
<p>timescale but 2-3 years is a good guess. Again most of this work can be done in </p>
<p>advance of acquiring the fissile material.”</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that there was a “pretty sharp contrast” between the </p>
<p>US and UK assessments of the time required by Iraq to obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Doug Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, had told him that the US </p>
<p>view was: “We think they can get to a nuclear device within a few months.” That had </p>
<p>prompted him to ask the DIS for advice. </p>
<p><b>432. </b> Mr Webb added that, in relation to essential components for a nuclear device, he </p>
<p>was aware that the AQ Khan network had placed Pakistani nuclear technology into the </p>
<p>hands of a number of states: </p>
<p>“I knew that AQ Khan had been providing designs to North Korea, to Libya. </p>
<p>I suppose I would probably have assumed that if he could do a design, why wouldn’t </p>
<p>he be prepared to hand over a [key nuclear component] if he had one?”</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>433. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that his focus “was all about timescales”. In the light </p>
<p>of the advice that one year would be required to produce “a real nuclear weapon, as </p>
<p>distinct from a dirty bomb, and two to three years for a nuclear missile”, he had informed </p>
<p>Mr Feith, “I think you are overdoing this, but at a year-ish we are in the same sort </p>
<p>of zone”. </p>

<p><b>436. </b> In the discussions with President Bush about a strategy of taking the issue of Iraq </p>
<p>back to the UN, Mr Blair identified the need for a public relations strategy that highlighted </p>
<p>both the risks of Saddam Hussein’s WMD programme and his “appalling” human </p>

<p>93</p>
<p>much harder to resist the logic that we must take action to deal with an evil regime that </p>
<p>threatened us with its WMD programme”. </p>
<p><b>438. </b> Mr Blair also considered that the US and UK would still face the question of why </p>
<p>they had decided to act now; “what had changed?” </p>
<p><b>439.  In the joint press conference on 6 April, Mr Blair stated that the threat of </b></p>
<p><b>WMD was real and had to be dealt with. </b></p>
<p><b>440. </b> Mr Blair said he and President Bush had agreed that “the issue of weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction cannot be ducked, it is a threat, it is a danger to our world and we must </p>
<p>heed that threat and act to prevent it being realised”.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>441. </b> Subsequently Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“There is a reason why United Nations resolutions were passed … calling upon him </p>
<p>[Saddam Hussein] to stop developing weapons of mass destruction … and that is </p>
<p>we know he has been developing the weapons.</p>
<p>“We know that those weapons constitute a threat …” </p>
<p><b>442. </b> As part of his advice to Mr Blair on a statement to Parliament about the discussions </p>
<p>with President Bush, Mr Straw wrote that Mr Blair could say that the document on Iraq </p>
<p>would be produced “shortly”.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> In Mr Straw’s view the UK could “certainly get something </p>
<p>out pretty quickly”. </p>
<p><b>443. </b> In his statement to the House of Commons on 10 April, Mr Blair said only that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “developing weapons of mass destruction”, was “a threat to his </p>
<p>own people and the region”, and that if he was “allowed to develop these weapons” that </p>
<p>would be a threat to the UK.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p><b>444. </b> In his response to a question from Mr Tam Dalyell (Labour), Mr Blair said there was </p>
<p>“no doubt” that Saddam Hussein was:</p>
<p> “… still trying to acquire nuclear capability and ballistic missile capability. </p>
<p>Furthermore, although we do not know what has happened, we suspect that the </p>
<p>piles of chemical and biological weapons remain.”</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Asked by Mr Llew Smith (Labour) on 16 April why he had not published the dossier </p>
<p>on the status of Iraq’s weapons programmes, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“We have already placed some evidence concerning Iraq’s programmes in the </p>
<p>Library of the House. When the time is right, we shall release further material, </p>
<p>including the threat posed by the development of weapons of mass destruction. </p>

<p><b>447. </b> In response to a suggestion that the dossier on Iraq had been stopped because it </p>

<p>UNSCOM what types of munitions the Iraqis had prepared or were working on at the </p>
<p>time of the Gulf War.”</p>
<p><b>453. </b> Mr Dowse concluded:</p>
<p>“I realise that this would not in the end hoodwink a real expert, who would be able </p>
<p>to reverse the calculation and work out that our assessment precursor quantities </p>
<p>had fallen. But the task would not be straightforward, and would be impossible for a </p>
<p>layman. And the result would, I think, have more impact on the target audience for </p>
<p>[an] unclassified paper.”</p>
<p><b>454. </b> Mr Scarlett sent Sir David Manning a revised draft of the paper on WMD on </p>
<p>4 April.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> That “differed slightly” from the version provided the previous week, because </p>
<p>figures for CW material for which UN inspectors had been unable to account had been </p>
<p>included. Those were being “double-checked”. </p>
<p><b>455. </b> The draft made clear that the UK could not be sure whether the material the </p>
<p>inspectors could not account for had been destroyed or remained at the disposal of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>456. </b> Before the first meeting of the inter-departmental group to discuss the paper on </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD prepared by the Assessments Staff, Mr McKane wrote to colleagues stating:</p>
<p>“The only outstanding question in relation to the WMD paper of which I am aware </p>
<p>is a discrepancy between certain numbers quoted by Ministers in Parliament and </p>
<p>the latest assessment generated in the preparation of the paper for publication. The </p>
<p>issue, as I understand it, is whether it is preferable to correct the previous answers </p>
<p>to Parliament by means of an inspired PQ or to disguise the discrepancy in the new </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Mr McKane’s meeting on 12 April agreed that:</p>
<p>“… in terms of public presentation, it would be desirable to stick with the chemical </p>
<p>weapons numbers used by Ministers in Parliament. If the numbers of tonnes </p>
<p>of declared precursor chemicals was in fact seriously out of line with latest DIS </p>
<p>assessments and US assessments, then we would recommend use of the new </p>
<p>numbers. Jane Hamilton-Eddy agreed to write following receipt of further input from </p>
<p>Sebastian Wood in Washington. Thereafter [junior official] would submit advice to </p>
<p>the Foreign Secretary in the course of next week. The numbers in the paper can </p>
<p>then be finalised …”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>458. </b> The FCO review of the revised DIS estimates for Iraqi holdings of precursor </p>
<p>chemicals and special munitions which were “unaccounted for” was sent to Mr Straw </p>
<p>on 23 April.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>459. </b> Mr Straw was told that the DIS had been asked to ensure that the figures </p>
<p>previously used in public were defensible, given that they were “based on a series of </p>
<p>Iraqi declarations (some of which have altered over time) extrapolated from data in </p>
<p>UNSCOM official records” and it was “inherently difficult to arrive at precise figures </p>
<p>(a point exemplified by the fact that there is no inter-Agency agreement in Washington </p>
<p>on a definitive set of numbers)”. The DIS had “therefore produced revised estimates </p>
<p>which it judges would be readily defensible in public”. </p>
<p><b>460. </b> The revised estimates were that:</p>
<p>“UNSCOM inspectors were unable to account for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>up to 3,000 tonnes (previously 4,000) of precursor chemicals, ‘approximately </p>
<p>300 (previously 610) tonnes of which … were unique to the production of </p>
<p>VX nerve agent’;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>up to 360 tonnes of bulk CW agent including 1.5 tonnes of VX (new figures); </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>and over 30,000 (previously 31,000) special munitions for delivery of </p>
<p>chemical and biological agents; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>large quantities of growth media acquired for use in the production of </p>
<p>biological weapons – enough to produce over three times the amount of </p>
<p>anthrax Iraq admits to having manufactured.”</p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr Straw was advised to announce the revised figures to Parliament, and </p>
<p>incorporate them into the “JIC public lines document” on Iraqi capabilities, which the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office would be submitting to Mr Blair “by the end of the month”. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> An alternative to such an announcement would be “to move away from precise </p>
<p>figures and use more general terms … on the grounds that precise figures are inherently </p>

<p>unreliable”. The “major downside to this approach” was that the media would “seize on </p>
<p>the more vague formulation to suggest that the Government has misled the public for the </p>
<p>past three years in talking up the Iraqi WMD threat”. </p>
<p><b>463. </b> To defend the new figures, the FCO suggested the answer should state:</p>
<p>“These figures represent our latest assessment. This assessment is subject to </p>
<p>continual review … The changes we have made do not alter our view on the scale of </p>
<p>the Iraqi WMD threat. Indeed, they reinforce our judgement that Iraq’s chemical and </p>
<p>biological capabilities are substantial and a very real danger to the region and the </p>
<p>wider world. We shall be releasing further material about this threat in due course.” </p>
<p><b>464. </b> In a manuscript comment on the submission to Mr Straw, Mr Dowse confirmed he </p>
<p>had agreed the minute which would “clear the way for release of the ‘WMD dossier’ – </p>
<p>but whether and when to do that awaits a separate decision”.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Mr McKane’s meeting on 26 April was informed that the FCO had sought </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s views on an inspired PQ to “bring our public statements on chemical </p>
<p>weapons numbers into line with the latest DIS estimates”.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>466. </b> Mr Straw agreed the recommended approach but asked that the answer should </p>
<p>explicitly draw attention to the fact that the figures had been revised, and that he was </p>
<p>correcting the estimates in an answer he had given during oral questions on 12 March.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr Straw also asked that press notice should be issued immediately after the </p>
<p>answer, “so that no-one can accuse us of concealing this”. </p>

<p><b>469.  In April the Iraq dossier was expanded to include material on human rights </b></p>

<p>of papers”, not “simply a document about weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> These were </p>
<p>worked on until June “when it was decided to put them on ice”.</p>

<p>Mr Straw.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p> Mr McKane added that he had asked for material produced around the time </p>
<p>of Operation Desert Fox “in case” Mr Blair decided “a more comprehensive treatment of </p>
<p>Saddam’s human rights record going back to the 1980s” was needed.</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Mr McKane also asked the FCO to “produce an expanded version of the paper </p>
<p>on Iraqi Human Rights abuses to cover Saddam’s record from his accession in 1979, </p>
<p>stating that the intention was “to produce a clear picture of Saddam’s record of human </p>
<p>rights abuses throughout his career”.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>473. </b> In relation to the draft paper on Iraqi Regime Crimes and Human Rights Abuses, </p>
<p>which also drew on intelligence, the FCO would revise the paper, “including boxes </p>
<p>to highlight particularly vivid and detailed pieces which illustrated the nature of the </p>
<p>regime”.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>474.  Junior officials in the FCO questioned whether the draft WMD paper would </b></p>
<p><b>be sufficient to underpin an argument that WMD posed such a threat that action </b></p>
<p><b>should be taken to deliver Iraq’s disarmament and offered suggestions to improve </b></p>
<p><b>its impact.</b></p>
<p><b>475. </b> Mr Mark Matthews, a junior official in the FCO News Department, was critical of </p>
<p>the style of the draft WMD paper and:</p>
<p>“… the repeated efforts of the authors to emphasise what they do not know as well </p>
<p>as what they know. In some cases this is necessary for the sake of accuracy. In </p>
<p>others it is unnecessary and unhelpful.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>476. </b> After offering detailed comments, Mr Matthews added:</p>
<p>“It is important that, where unnecessary and unhelpful, these expressions of </p>
<p>the authors’ uncertainty are removed. Otherwise we risk undermining further </p>
<p>a paper which already looks a little thinner than earlier versions of evidence </p>
<p>of Iraqi wrongdoing.” </p>
<p><b>477. </b> Mr Matthews also provided a “revised version of the general briefing paper”, </p>
<p>including a draft Introduction by the Foreign Secretary. The document shows that the </p>
<p>briefing paper would set out the wider context of policy on Iraq and would be issued by </p>
<p>the FCO. The detailed papers on Iraq’s WMD and Saddam’s human rights abuses being </p>
<p>prepared under the auspices of the inter-departmental group would be published as </p>
<p>Annexes to that paper. </p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>478. </b> The points in the draft Introduction included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continued to claim that it had “no chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>We are therefore taking the important step of publishing further information </p>
<p>from Government intelligence reports about Iraq’s weapons. This shows there </p>
<p>is no doubt that Iraq has dangerous chemical, biological and nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programmes.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The concern was “heightened” by Saddam Hussein’s previous use of “these </p>
<p>horrific weapons”. That made him, and the threat he posed, “unique”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would “use these weapons again in pursuit of his aim of </p>
<p>regional domination and against the West if he thinks he can get away with it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Doing nothing about this threat” was “not an option”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That was why the Government was “devoting immense diplomatic energy to </p>
<p>pressing Iraq to comply with UN resolutions to destroy its weapons”, including </p>
<p>giving “UN weapons inspectors full and unfettered access”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government was “serious about wanting to resolve this issue through </p>
<p>compliance with UN resolutions …”</p>
<p><b>479. </b> The key points identified in the FCO briefing paper included statements that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime was “a demonstrable threat to the stability of the region as a </p>
<p>result of its continued development of weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The onus of complying with UN resolutions was on Saddam Hussein: “If Iraq </p>
<p>poses no threat, why does he continue to refuse access to UN inspectors?” </p>
<p><b>480. </b> Sending the email and FCO briefing paper to Mr McKane, Dr Tanfield wrote:</p>
<p>“I would like you to see this now because I am not convinced that NPD </p>
<p>[Non-Proliferation Department] is giving DIS/AS [Assessments Staff] a sufficiently </p>

<p>211</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>482. </b> The Assessment did not examine Iraq’s WMD capabilities but, in a concluding </p>
<p>paragraph entitled “<b>Making the case</b>”, it stated:</p>
<p>“<b>For governments expected to support a US-led attack, the justification and </b></p>
<p><b>evidence will be crucial in managing their public presentation.</b> Given that we </p>
<p>judge Iraq had no responsibility for, or foreknowledge of, the 11 September terrorist </p>
<p>attacks, Iraq’s neighbours are likely to demand stronger proof of Iraq’s development </p>

<p><b>483.  Following a meeting chaired by Mr Campbell, it was agreed that the Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>dossier should include a history of weapons inspections and an explanation of </b></p>
<p><b>the sanctions regime.</b></p>
<p><b>484. </b> Reflecting the decision recorded in Mr Rycroft’s manuscript note of 25 March, that </p>
<p>he would “retain the lead role on the timing/form of the release” of the document on Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Campbell held a meeting on 23 April.</p>
<p><b>485. </b> The meeting agreed that the Government:</p>
<p>“should aim to release …: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>the dossier on WMD: JIC will continue their work;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>a readable history of weapons inspections: FCO will compile;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>an explanatory note on sanctions to get across the message that our fight is </p>
<p>not with the Iraqi people: FCO will prepare;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>a note detailing the Iraqi regime’s human rights abuses: FCO will look again </p>
<p>at the material it has prepared for release with the WMD dossier.”</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>486. </b> The documents should be released “as a prelude to a further push on getting the </p>
<p>UN weapons inspectors back into Iraq”. That could be done through a statement by </p>
<p>Mr Straw linked to the UN Security Council’s agreement to the Goods Review List (GRL) </p>
<p>(see Section 3.3). An alternative might be publication when the GRL entered into force at </p>
<p>the end of May. </p>
<p><b>487.  Mr Straw considered that publication of the dossier on WMD should be </b></p>
<p><b>separate from action in the UN on the revised Goods Review List. </b></p>
<p><b>488. </b> Mr Ben Bradshaw, FCO Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, told the FAC on </p>
<p>23 April:</p>
<p>“We will put more evidence in the public domain and we will publish in whatever form </p>
<p>we think is most effective … When we feel the time is right.”</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>489. </b> The FCO official who attended Mr Campbell’s meeting advised Mr Straw that it </p>
<p>would be better to separate the publication of the Iraq dossier and the discussion of the </p>
<p>GRL/Oil-for-Food (OFF) resolution in the UN for a number of reasons; and proposed a </p>
<p>number of briefing exercises instead.</p>

<p>Director Middle East and North Africa, agreed. </p>
<p><b>491. </b> A letter from Mr Straw’s Private Office to Mr Campbell on 25 April recorded </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s understanding that Mr Campbell’s meeting had:</p>
<p>“… agreed that the launch of the Iraq dossier must not convey a misleading </p>
<p>impression of imminent military action, and therefore decided that new material </p>
<p>should be added to cover the record of inspections, humanitarian issues and </p>
<p>the GRL.”</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>492. </b> The letter set out the FCO preference for separating publication of the dossier from </p>
<p>activity on a GRL, including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The WMD dossier would eclipse the humanitarian message of the GRL/OFF </p>
<p>resolution.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Arab world” was “particularly unreceptive at present”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “best bet” might be for publication to coincide “with a renewed effort to get </p>
<p>weapons inspections readmitted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The release of the dossier should be co-ordinated with the US and briefing </p>
<p>“governments, notably in the Arab world, in greater detail than is possible in a </p>

<p>circulated by the Cabinet Office on 6 June.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>507. </b>  The CIC had produced a revised draft of a Foreword for the document. That </p>
<p>identified Saddam Hussein as personally responsible for Iraq’s WMD programmes and </p>
<p>defying the Security Council resolutions. It amended the previous text, which stated that </p>
<p>the papers showed “there was no doubt that Iraq has chemical, biological and nuclear </p>
<p>programmes”, to a statement that they showed “Saddam Hussein has dangerous </p>
<p>chemical, biological weapons and is nearing completion of nuclear weapons”. </p>
<p><b>508. </b> The draft Foreword also changed the statement about the UK’s diplomatic efforts </p>
<p>to resolve the issue through compliance with UN resolutions to one which stated:</p>
<p>“The world is urging Saddam Hussein to comply … giving UN weapons inspectors </p>
<p>… access to Iraq – <b>any time, any place, any where</b>.</p>
<p>“No decision has been taken to launch military action. It is up to Saddam Hussein to </p>
<p>show the world that he is serious about fulfilling Iraq’s … obligations.”</p>
<p><b>509. </b> The CIC had reformatted and reordered the text of the Summary and draft paper </p>
<p>‘Iraqi WMD Programmes’, including addressing Iraq’s nuclear capabilities first, before its </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles. The substance was, however, </p>
<p>largely unchanged. </p>
<p><b>510. </b> The CIC added summaries for the papers on the ‘History of UN Weapons </p>

<p>number of minor changes to the former, the most important of which was to correct a </p>
<p>statement that Iraq had, in 1991, been “within 1-2 years” of acquiring a nuclear weapon. </p>
<p>Consistent with the paper on Iraqi WMD programmes, that was replaced by the words </p>
<p>“within less than three years”.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> A detailed list of occasions on which UN inspectors had been harassed or denied </p>
<p>access to sites was removed. </p>

<p>understood by the public”.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>513. </b> Mr Miller reported to Mr McKane on 7 June that there was “no serious difference </p>
<p>of analysis or interpretation” between the US and UK on WMD.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> He also reported that </p>
<p>work had been commissioned on a US paper for publication on Iraqi WMD.</p>
<p><b>514. </b> The paper on Iraq produced for the Chiefs of Staff “Strategic Think Tank” on </p>
<p>18 June, stated:</p>
<p>“Although Iraq’s nuclear capability (essentially a ‘dirty’ bomb) cannot be dismissed, </p>
<p>the main threat, at the moment, is from CB weapons.”</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>515. </b> In a minute to Mr Miller on 17 June, a junior official in the Assessments Staff </p>
<p>confirmed that the CIC had attempted “to reformat the Iraqi WMD section of the </p>

<p><b>519. </b> The inter-departmental group advised:</p>
<p>“… that the drafts should now be held in readiness for an appropriate moment to </p>
<p>issue them. Choosing that moment requires careful judgement. The publication </p>
<p>of the documents will be regarded by some as an indication that the Government </p>
<p>has moved closer to decisions on military action. On the other hand, as part of </p>
<p>the carefully co-ordinated exercise, they could serve to increase the pressure on </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein.”</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Mr McKane reported that Mr Scarlett’s “strong preference” was to:</p>
<p>“… keep the WMD paper separate in order to preserve its status as a considered </p>
<p>assessment of what the intelligence says about Iraq’s existing WMD capabilities – </p>
<p>in contrast with the other two papers which are based on a mixture of historical </p>
<p>material, intelligence and reportage. Most of my group felt that this point was </p>
<p>out-weighed by the advantages of presenting the three papers as a single package, </p>
<p>in particular because of the close relationship between the WMD and the Weapons </p>
<p>Inspection papers.”</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Mr McKane also provided a copy of the separate draft paper addressing wider </p>
<p>WMD programmes of concern, stating that:</p>
<p>“The Foreign Office, in particular, have advised that this paper should not be </p>
<p>published at the same time as the Iraq dossier, because of awkward comparisons </p>
<p>which might be drawn between the threat posed by other countries of concern </p>
<p>and that posed by Iraq. More generally, the FCO have concerns about the quality </p>
<p>of the ‘evidence’ …” </p>
<p><b>522. </b> Mr McKane concluded: </p>
<p>“Despite the case for shining a spotlight on all states of WMD concern, the balance </p>
<p>of the arguments points towards delaying, at least until we are clearer about the way </p>
<p>forward on Iraq.”</p>

<p>produced by the CIC on 3 June. The key changes to the WMD paper were:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The text on nuclear weapons in the draft Foreword was amended to state the </p>
<p>papers showed only that Saddam Hussein was “still seeking to acquire nuclear </p>
<p>weapons”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>References to Iraq’s ability to produce ricin and its effect were added to the </p>
<p>section on biological agents in the paper on Iraq’s WMD programmes.</p>
<p><b>524. </b> The key points in the paper on UN inspections, which drew on published and </p>
<p>intelligence sources, including reports by UN personnel and non-Government sources, </p>
<p>are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>‘UN Weapons Inspections in Iraq’</b></p>
<p>The draft FCO paper on weapons inspections stated:</p>
<p>“The history of UN weapons inspections in Iraq has been characterised by persistent </p>
<p>Iraqi efforts to frustrate, deceive and intimidate inspectors. Despite the conduct of the </p>
<p>Iraqi authorities towards them, both UNSCOM and the IAEA … have valuable records </p>
<p>of achievement …</p>
<p>“By the end of 1998 there nevertheless remained significant uncertainties about the </p>
<p>disposition of Iraq’s prohibited WMD programmes. A series of confrontations and the </p>
<p>systematic refusal by Iraq to co-operate, left UNSCOM unable to perform its mandate </p>
<p>and the inspectors withdrew …”</p>
<p>Since December 1998, Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… refused absolutely to comply with its UN … obligations and allow access to </p>
<p>weapons inspectors. We judge that Iraq has used the intervening … period to </p>
<p>rebuild significant aspects of its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes.”</p>
<p>That was “a direct challenge to the authority of the UN”. In addition, Iraq’s actions </p>
<p>breached its commitments under:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention – which bans the development, </p>
<p>production, stockpiling, acquisition or retention of biological weapons; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – which prohibits Iraq from manufacturing or </p>
<p>otherwise acquiring nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>The paper described the setting up of two inspection teams in accordance with the </p>
<p>provisions of resolution 687 (1991) and set out an account of Iraq’s concealment of </p>
<p>its activities together with a list of “infamous examples” of Iraq’s harassment of the </p>
<p>inspectors. </p>
<p>The 20 June version of the paper acknowledged that special access to Presidential </p>
<p>sites had been negotiated in 1998. A statement in the initial draft that the sites housed </p>
<p>units “which had in the past been associated with concealing Iraq’s WMD programme” </p>
<p>was replaced by a statement that they were “an integral part of Iraqi counter-measures </p>
<p>expressly designed to hide weapons material”.</p>
<p>The initial reference to Iraq having “admitted… a large, effective, system for hiding </p>
<p>proscribed material” was replaced by a reference to Iraq’s acknowledgement that it had </p>
<p>set up a unit in April 1991 to “conceal vital aspects of its proscribed programmes”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>The paper set out in considerable detail Iraq’s “blatant” obstruction of UN inspectors in </p>
<p>relation to its biological weapons programme. Iraq did not acknowledge that biological </p>
<p>agents had been produced “on an industrial scale” until July 1995. It also “admitted </p>
<p>producing in excess of 200 biological weapons with a reserve of agent to fill considerably </p>
<p>more”. Subsequent disclosures in relation to the programme were “technically inadequate” </p>
<p>and Iraq had refused to elaborate on the details.</p>
<p>The paper also set out the inspectors’ achievements in dismantling and destroying </p>
<p>Iraq’s proscribed weapons systems, but “a series of significant unresolved disarmament </p>
<p>issues remained”.</p>
<p>The paper stated the UK believed “that Iraq has pressed ahead with its WMD </p>
<p>programmes” since 1998; and that the heads of UNSCOM and the IAEA had “declared </p>
<p>that in the absence of inspections”, it was “impossible to verify Iraq’s compliance with </p>
<p>its … obligations”.</p>
<p>The paper concluded:</p>
<p>“In the interests of regional and global security, the international community cannot </p>
<p>allow this stand off to continue indefinitely.” </p>
<p><b>525. </b>  In a report published on 20 June, the FAC recommended that the UK Government </p>
<p>should follow the precedent it had set in relation to Afghanistan, in October 2001, and:</p>
<p>“… publish the fullest possible documentation on the need for further military action, </p>
<p>before any such action is seriously contemplated. While nothing should be published </p>
<p>which might compromise sources or methods of intelligence, the Government must </p>
<p>try to secure the widest possible support in Parliament and among the British people </p>
<p>if it is proposing to risk the lives of British servicemen and women as part of a further </p>
<p>phase of the war against terrorism.”</p>
<p>227 </p>
<p><b>526.  In mid-July, No.10 officials decided that publication should be put on hold for </b></p>
<p><b>the time being.</b></p>
<p><b>527. </b> During questions on Iraq from the Liaison Committee on 16 July (see Section 3.3), </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied that “as far as he was aware there was no evidence linking Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein to the actual attack on 11 September”; and that there were “various rough </p>
<p>linkages” to Al Qaida; but the issue (on Iraq) was “weapons of mass destruction. It is not </p>
<p>what happened on 11 September or the Al Qaida terrorist network.”</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>528. </b> Asked what had changed since President Bush took office, Mr Blair replied:</p>

<p>231</p>

<p><b>531. </b> It was also agreed that the draft would not be shown to the US until closer to the </p>
<p>date of publication and that:</p>
<p>“We should keep an open mind on whether to publish the Iraq WMD paper </p>

<p>either the Foreign and Defence Secretaries, or possibly the Prime Minister.” </p>
<p><b>532. </b> Mr McKane told the Inquiry that he had “had an exchange with Sir David Manning </p>

<p>4.1  |  Iraq WMD assessments, pre-July 2002</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>534. </b> In his press conference on 25 July, Mr Blair was asked a number of questions </p>
<p>about the policy on Iraq (see Section 3.3).</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> Asked why the promised dossier laying out </p>
<p>the evidence against Saddam Hussein had not appeared, Mr Blair stated that it would be </p>
<p>published when he judged it to be the right moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>535.  The ingrained belief that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible </b></p>
<p><b>enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>capability, and was pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment, had </b></p>
<p><b>underpinned UK policy towards Iraq since the Gulf Conflict ended in 1991. </b></p>
<p><b>536.  While the detail of individual JIC Assessments on Iraq varied, this core </b></p>
<p><b>construct remained in place. </b></p>
<p><b>537.  Security Council resolutions adopted since 1991, demanded Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>disarmament and the re-admission of inspectors, and imposed sanctions in the </b></p>
<p><b>absence of Iraqi compliance with those – and other – obligations. Agreement to </b></p>
<p><b>those resolutions indicated that doubts about whether Iraq had disarmed were </b></p>
<p><b>widely shared.</b></p>
<p><b>538.  In parallel, by 2000, the wider risk of proliferation was regarded as a major </b></p>
<p><b>threat. There was heightened concern about:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the danger of proliferation, particularly that countries of concern might </b></p>
<p><b>obtain nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the potential risk that terrorist groups which were willing to use them </b></p>
<p><b>might gain access to chemical and biological agents and, possibly, nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>material, and the means to deliver them.</b></p>
<p><b>539.  These concerns were reinforced after 9/11. </b></p>
<p><b>540.  The view conveyed in JIC Assessments between December 2000 and </b></p>
<p><b>March 2002 was that, despite the considerable achievements of UNSCOM and </b></p>
<p><b>the IAEA between 1991 and December 1998, including dismantling Iraq’s nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>programme, the inspectors had been unable to account for some of the ballistic </b></p>
<p><b>missiles and chemical and biological weapons and material produced by Iraq; and </b></p>
<p><b>that it had:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>not totally destroyed all its stockpile of chemical and biological weapons;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>retained up to 360 tonnes of chemical agents and precursor chemicals </b></p>
<p><b>and growth media which would allow it to produce more chemical and </b></p>
<p><b>biological agents;</b></p>
<p>234 </p>
<p>The National Archives, <i>Prime Minister’s Press Conference, 25 July 2002</i>.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>hidden a small number of long-range Al Hussein ballistic missiles; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>retained the knowledge, documentation and personnel which would allow </b></p>
<p><b>it to reconstitute its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </b></p>
<p><b>programmes. </b></p>
<p><b>541.  The JIC also judged that, since the departure of the weapons inspectors, Iraq: </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>was actively pursuing programmes to extend the range of its existing </b></p>
<p><b>short-range ballistic missiles beyond the permitted range of 150km;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>had begun development of a ballistic missile with a range greater than </b></p>
<p><b>1,000km;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>was capable of resuming undetected production of “significant quantities” </b></p>
<p><b>of chemical and biological agents, and in the case of VX might have </b></p>
<p><b>already done so; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>was pursuing activities that could be linked to a nuclear programme.</b></p>
<p><b>542.  Iraq’s chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a </b></p>
<p><b>threat to international peace and security in the Middle East region, but Iraq was </b></p>
<p><b>viewed as a less serious proliferation threat than other key countries of concern – </b></p>
<p><b>Iran, Libya and North Korea – which had current nuclear programmes. Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>nuclear facilities had been dismantled by the weapons inspectors. The JIC </b></p>
<p><b>judged that Iraq would be unable to obtain a nuclear weapon while sanctions </b></p>
<p><b>remained effective.</b></p>
<p><b>543.  The JIC continued to judge that co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was </b></p>
<p><b>“unlikely”, and that there was no “credible evidence of Iraqi transfers of WMD-</b></p>
<p><b>related technology and expertise to terrorist groups”. </b></p>
<p><b>544.  In mid-February 2002, in preparation for Mr Blair’s planned meeting with </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush in early April 2002, No.10 commissioned the preparation of a </b></p>
<p><b>paper to inform the public about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and WMD </b></p>
<p><b>more generally in four key countries of concern, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>545.  When the preparation of this document became public knowledge, it was </b></p>
<p><b>perceived to be intended to underpin a decision on military action against Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>The content and timing became a sensitive issue.</b></p>
<p><b>546.  Reflecting the UK position that action was needed to disarm Iraq, Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>and Mr Straw began, from late February 2002, publicly to argue that Iraq was a </b></p>
<p><b>threat which had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm or be disarmed in </b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the obligations imposed by the UN; and that it was important to </b></p>
<p><b>agree to the return of UN inspectors to Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>547.  The focus on Iraq was not the result of a step change in Iraq’s capabilities </b></p>
<p><b>or intentions.</b></p>

<p><b>548.  When he saw the draft paper on WMD countries of concern on 8 March, </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Straw commented:</b></p>
<p><b>“Good, but should not Iraq be first and also have more text? The paper has </b></p>
<p><b>to show why there is an exceptional threat from Iraq. It does not quite do </b></p>
<p><b>this yet.”</b></p>
<p>235</p>
<p><b>549.  On 18 March, Mr Straw decided that a paper on Iraq should be issued before </b></p>

<p><b>550.  On 22 March, Mr Straw was advised that the evidence would not convince </b></p>

<p><b>551.  Publication was postponed. No.10 decided that the Cabinet Office Overseas </b></p>
<p><b>and Defence Secretariat should co-ordinate the production of a “public dossier” </b></p>
<p><b>on Iraq, and that Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and </b></p>
<p><b>Strategy, should “retain the lead role on the timing/form of its release”.</b></p>
<p><b>552.  The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public, </b></p>
<p><b>from late 2001 onwards, about Iraq’s proscribed activities and the potential </b></p>
<p><b>threat they posed were understandably written in more direct and less nuanced </b></p>
<p><b>language than the JIC Assessments on which they drew. </b></p>
<p><b>553.  The question is whether, in doing so, they conveyed more certainty and </b></p>
<p><b>knowledge than was justified, or created tests it would be impossible for Iraq to </b></p>
<p><b>meet. That is of particular concern in relation to the evidence in this Section on </b></p>
<p><b>two key issues.</b></p>
<p><b>554.  First, the estimates of the weapons and material related to Iraq’s chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological warfare programmes for which UNSCOM had been unable to </b></p>
<p><b>account were based on extrapolations from UNSCOM records. Officials explicitly </b></p>
<p><b>advised that it was “inherently difficult to arrive at precise figures”. In addition, it </b></p>
<p><b>was acknowledged that neither UNSCOM nor the UK could be certain about either </b></p>
<p><b>exactly what had existed or what Iraq had already destroyed.</b></p>
<p><b>555.  The revised estimates announced by Mr Straw on 2 May were increasingly </b></p>
<p><b>presented in Government statements as the benchmark against which Iraq should </b></p>
<p><b>be judged.</b></p>
<p><b>556.  Second, the expert MOD examination of issues in late March 2002 exposed </b></p>
<p><b>the difficulties Iraq would have to overcome before it could acquire a nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>weapon. That included the difficulty of acquiring suitable fissile material from the </b></p>
<p><b>“black market”. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>557.  In addition, the tendency to refer in public statements only to Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>“weapons of mass destruction” without addressing their nature (the type of </b></p>
<p><b>warhead and whether they were battlefield or strategic weapons systems) or </b></p>
<p><b>how they might be used (as a last resort against invading military forces or as a </b></p>
<p><b>weapon of terror to threaten civilian populations in other countries) was likely to </b></p>
<p><b>have created the impression that Iraq posed a greater threat than the detailed JIC </b></p>
<p><b>Assessments would have supported. </b></p>
