<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the discussions within the UK Government between </p>
<p>September 2000 and September 2001 on the UK’s Iraq strategy, in the light of questions </p>
<p>over the sustainability of the existing policy of containing Iraq, the election of a new US </p>
<p>Administration and concerns over the legal basis for the No-Fly Zones (NFZs). </p>
<p><b>2. </b> The Section follows on from Section 1.1, which addresses the UK’s Iraq strategy </p>
<p>between 1990 and September 2000, and is followed by Section 3.1, which addresses </p>
<p>the development of the UK’s Iraq strategy from September 2001. Section 3.1 also </p>
<p>summarises UK policy and thinking in September 2001.</p>
<p><b>Before September 2000</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> Iraq’s failure to comply fully with UN Security Council resolutions over a period of </p>
<p>10 years, or with international treaties to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons, was seen as a challenge to international order, the authority  </p>
<p>of the UN and the rule of law. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> On the basis of its past behaviour, and the evidence found by UN and the </p>
<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors between 1991 and 1998, it was </p>
<p>widely assumed that, although the inspections had been successful in dismantling and </p>
<p>containing Iraq’s capabilities, Saddam Hussein’s regime had the intent and much of the </p>
<p>knowledge to develop ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction if it had the </p>
<p>opportunity to do so. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> In addition, the UK Government and some others believed that, given the </p>
<p>opportunity, Saddam Hussein aspired to exercise regional power through the threat </p>
<p>or use of force, and would not be constrained by international law or decisions of the </p>
<p>Security Council. </p>
<p><b>6. </b> A policy of containing Iraq initially designed to meet short-term needs had been </p>
<p>extended for over a decade. Sanctions were hurting the population of Iraq without  </p>
<p>having a significant effect on Saddam Hussein’s regime. The Security Council was </p>
<p>divided about the benefit of maintaining sanctions and the way ahead, and there were </p>
<p>doubts about how long the existing policy could be sustained. Iraq was confident in </p>
<p>continuing to resist the return of inspectors. Internal opposition had been suppressed </p>
<p>and exile organisations had limited support. The strains within the international </p>
<p>community were clear. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> The <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction</i>, the Butler Report, </p>
<p>concluded in July 2004 that there was a “progressive reduction” in the Joint Intelligence </p>
<p>Committee’s (JIC’s) estimates of Iraq’s capabilities in the period to 1994/1995 but </p>
<p>“growing suspicions and concerns” between 1995 and 1998.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Those suspicions and </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p><i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> [“The Butler Report”], 14 July 2004, HC 898.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September 2000 to September 2001</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>concerns were “exacerbated and reinforced by Iraqi prevarication, concealment and </p>
<p>deception”. The Butler Review detected “signs that this context led to the JIC making </p>
<p>its estimates of Iraqi capabilities on an over-cautious or worst case basis (not always </p>
<p>declared as such)”. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The Butler Report concluded that the JIC Assessments would have left the </p>
<p>impression in the minds of readers “of suspicion and concern about Iraq’s break-</p>
<p>out capability” coupled with “possible possession” of chemical and biological agent </p>
<p>stockpiles in breach of Iraq’s obligations and “concern about the ability of Iraq to </p>
<p>regenerate a small number of ballistic missiles”. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The UK’s assessment of Iraq’s continued possession of weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>(WMD) in defiance of the obligations imposed by the UN is set out in Sections 4.1 to 4.3. </p>
<p>Those Sections also address the UK’s wider concerns about proliferation. The Butler </p>
<p>Report is addressed in Section 4.4.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The framework in which the UK, and other states, viewed Iraq in 2000 was </p>
<p>determined by their experience since 1990. That conditioned their positions and </p>
<p>behaviour and provided the background to the UK review of policy in autumn 2000, </p>
<p>which is the starting point of the Inquiry’s considerations. </p>
<p><b>The erosion of the sanctions regime </b></p>
<p>In his statement for the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent Representative </p>
<p>to the UN in New York from July 1998 to July 2003, wrote:</p>
<p>“In 2000, little new work was done on Iraq, with the Security Council largely </p>
<p>exhausted with the subject … Sanctions continued, but the [sanctions] regime </p>
<p>remained vulnerable to Iraqi non-co-operation and deceit and the feeling that </p>
<p>sanctions were gradually unravelling increasingly took hold internationally.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A number of reasons for the erosion of sanctions were offered to the Inquiry, including the </p>
<p>lack of consensus within the Security Council, the loss of international public support and </p>
<p>a decline in the willingness of many nations to enforce sanctions. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Of all the issues that I dealt with in the Security Council, Iraq produced the greatest </p>
<p>divisions among the Permanent Five</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>… </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The United States was at one end of the spectrum in regarding Iraq as a threat and </p>
<p>as regarding the United Nations as unable to deal with the threat in a way which was </p>
<p>required. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>“The United Kingdom was sympathetic to that view, but wanted to see the United </p>
<p>Nations operating successfully on Iraq because we regarded it as a collective </p>
<p>problem. The French, Russians and Chinese had all abstained on [resolution] 1284, </p>
<p>and were therefore not particularly on the side of just straight containment of Iraq, </p>
<p>because they also wanted to see progress towards the end of sanctions. </p>
<p>“The other members of the Security Council were mainly of that view, that they did </p>
<p>not see that the downsides of sanctions, as far as the humanitarian effects on the </p>
<p>Iraqi people were concerned, were worth the degree of containment which they </p>
<p>[sanctions] provided for an Iraq, the threat from which was not fully proven, in their </p>
<p>view, in terms either of military capability or in terms of possession of weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction.</p>
<p>… </p>
<p>“I don’t think there was a single member of the Security Council who believed </p>
<p>that Iraq was trying honestly and honourably to meet Security Council conditions. </p>
<p>I don’t think there was a single member of [the] Security Council, throughout my </p>
<p>period there, who supported Saddam Hussein or Iraq. I don’t think there was a </p>
<p>single member of the Security Council who believed that Iraq was innocent, was </p>
<p>not plotting to develop military capability, was not defying United Nations, was not </p>
<p>cheating on sanctions but … [there was a] spectrum of views about how intensely </p>
<p>that was a problem and about how it should be dealt with.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Mr Geoff Hoon, FCO Minister of State responsible for the Middle East from May 1999 </p>
<p>(and the Defence Secretary from October 1999), told the Inquiry that public leaders </p>
<p>in the Middle East: </p>
<p>“… blamed us for … starving the Iraqi people, for depriving them of medical </p>
<p>supplies … sanctions were failing … they were not delivering the benefit that we </p>
<p>anticipated politically and … worse than that, we were getting the blame for things </p>
<p>that were actually Saddam’s responsibility.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir William Patey, Head of the FCO’s Middle East Department from 1999 to March  </p>
<p>2002, told the Inquiry that Saddam Hussein had been “very good” at manipulating  </p>
<p>the sanctions regime, to create sympathy within the Arab world and to preserve  </p>
<p>his own regime.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006, told the Inquiry that, without </p>
<p>weapons inspectors on the ground in Iraq and “with a collapse in international will to </p>
<p>enforce, or even merely to sustain, a sanctions regime, ‘containing’ the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>became a challenge”.</p>

<p>1.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September 2000 to September 2001</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>The Inquiry asked Sir William Patey why it appeared that the countries neighbouring Iraq </p>
<p>were becoming less concerned about the threat from Iraq and more willing to allow trade </p>
<p>to carry on in contravention of the sanctions regime.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> Sir William told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>those countries’ attitudes to Iraq varied: </p>
<p>“… the concern was greater in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia than it was in Syria and </p>
<p>Turkey, and Jordan had a rather special relationship with Iraq, a dependency </p>
<p>relationship, it was very worried about its economy and being cut off. So there were </p>
<p>a complex set of relationships.</p>
<p>“I think I would describe the region as, if they had had faith in the policy, they would </p>
<p>have supported it more, but if it was going to fail, they didn’t want to be on the wrong </p>
<p>side of Saddam … I would say they were hedging their bets … not that … they were </p>
<p>unaware of the threat.” </p>
<p>Sir William also told the Inquiry that the complexity of the sanctions regime itself, </p>
<p>including the Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme, meant that Iraq was able to evade the </p>
<p>controls.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>While sanctions on civilian trade were eroding, the UK assessed that the arms embargo </p>
<p>on Iraq remained broadly effective. </p>
<p>Mr Simon Webb, MOD Director General Operational Policy from July 1999 to September </p>
<p>2001, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… The general impression we had … by the start of 2001 was that the arms </p>
<p>embargo was, in general, holding up well … almost all members of the United </p>
<p>Nations were abiding by it, which was preventing the Iraqis from acquiring major </p>
<p>new weapons systems … but there was some leakage still of parts and components </p>
<p>which allowed them [the Iraqi military] to be a bit more effective.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Mr Carne Ross, First Secretary responsible for the Middle East at the UK Permanent </p>
<p>Mission to the United Nations in New York (UKMIS New York) from 1997 to 2002, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“While there were serious sanctions breaches, it was not the UK judgement that </p>
<p>these permitted significant rearmament, which was our major concern.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>Review of the UK’s strategy on Iraq, autumn 2000</b></p>
<p><b>11. </b> Section 1.1 addresses the UK’s review of its strategy on Iraq in May 1999.  </p>
<p>The review concluded that, despite the difficulties in sustaining the strategy:</p>
<p>“Containment … remains the only viable option for achieving our policy objectives.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>12. </b> In April 2000, the JIC judged that it was likely that Iraq was continuing to develop </p>
<p>offensive biological and chemical warfare capabilities (see Section 4.1).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>13. </b> In June 2000, as part of a “continuing series of papers addressing Iraqi issues”,  </p>
<p>the JIC assessed Iraq’s response to the NFZs.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> The JIC stated that Iraq continued to challenge coalition patrols of the NFZs. In the </p>
<p>preceding year, Iraq had concentrated on using anti-aircraft artillery and highly mobile </p>
<p>surface-to-air missile systems and rockets to fire at US and UK aircraft “on most days </p>
<p>they flew”. The capability of Iraq’s air and air-defence forces was “limited” but there was </p>
<p>a “continuing, albeit small, risk” of losing an aircraft. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The JIC judged that if Saddam Hussein decided to co-operate with UN Security </p>
<p>Council resolution (UNSCR) 1284 (1999), he would, in return, seek the abolition  </p>
<p>of the NFZs. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> On 22 September, a French civilian aircraft flew from Paris to Baghdad without the </p>
<p>UN Sanctions Committee’s approval.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> The Box below addresses the background to and </p>
<p>implications of that flight.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The FCO set out the Government’s position in a telegram to the British Embassy </p>
<p>Moscow on 3 October:</p>
<p>“The legal position on flights is not clear but our position, based on past practice </p>
<p>relating to SCRs 661 and 670, is that approval for all flights to Iraq must be sought </p>
<p>from the Sanctions Committee and is granted on humanitarian grounds only … </p>
<p>EC [European Commission] Regulations prohibit flights from the EU [European </p>
<p>Union] which do not have Security Council approval. Others challenge this legal </p>
<p>interpretation and claim that the resolutions do not prohibit civilian flights. A number </p>
<p>of countries led by France and Russia have recently allowed aircraft to fly to </p>
<p>Baghdad without Committee approval (and in the case of France, in clear breach </p>
<p>of the EC regulation). We are likely to begin discussion in the P5 soon on a revised </p>
<p>Security Council position. It would strengthen our hand in the debate if we could </p>
<p>stem the flow of non-approved flights to Iraq. Above all, we must resist a resumption </p>
<p>of commercial flights which would be a far greater challenge to our position and to </p>
<p>the sanctions regime than the present flurry of non-commercial flights.”</p>

<p>193</p>
<p><b>Challenges to the ban on air travel </b></p>
<p>Throughout the 1990s, the UN Sanctions Committee and UN Member States had </p>
<p>interpreted the provisions of resolution 670 (1990) to require the Sanctions Committee’s </p>
<p>approval for all civilian flights to Iraq. </p>
<p>Baghdad International Airport reopened in August 2000.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An FCO official informed the Private Office of Mr Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, </p>
<p>on 22 September 2000 that a French civilian aircraft had flown from Paris to Baghdad, </p>
<p>without the Sanctions Committee’s approval.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Although the French Mission notified the </p>
<p>Committee in advance, in doing so it stated that it was not seeking approval for the flight </p>
<p>and it disregarded a request from the chairman of the Committee that the flight should be </p>
<p>delayed so that the matter might be considered by Committee members.</p>
<p>The FCO official set out the background: </p>
<p>“The French and Russians have been pressing for some time for a relaxation on </p>
<p>civilian flights to Baghdad, claiming it is time to end the cultural and intellectual </p>
<p>isolation of the Iraqi people. They challenge our interpretation of the UNSCRs and </p>
<p>claim there are no restrictions on flights which do not carry cargo, although they </p>
<p>accept that SCR 661 prohibits the financial arrangements necessary for commercial </p>
<p>flights to Iraq.”</p>
<p>The media subsequently reported that Russia intended to resume scheduled flights  </p>
<p>to Baghdad. </p>
<p>The briefing for Mr Cook’s meeting with the French Foreign Minister, at Cahors on </p>
<p>9 February 2001, stated that:</p>
<p>“Since Baghdad International Airport reopened in August 2000, there have been </p>
<p>over 150 humanitarian flights into Iraq. Although the Iraq regime has tried to portray </p>
<p>these as sanctions-breaking, all but a handful (including one French flight) have </p>
<p>received advance approval from the UN Sanctions Committee.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Straw stated that as a result of the lack of action by </p>
<p>the UN to censure the flight, Saddam Hussein demanded that other key international </p>
<p>partners begin flights into Baghdad, leading to the “total collapse” of the travel ban.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>18.  With the containment policy under pressure, and in preparation for </b></p>
<p><b>discussions with a new US Administration, the UK reviewed its policy on Iraq. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>“In Autumn 2000, ahead of the US Presidential election, the Government </p>
<p>initiated a stock-take of Iraq policy in order to be ready to engage with a new US </p>
<p>Administration, which was expected to undertake its own review, irrespective of who </p>
<p>won the election.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts, Chairman of the JIC until September 2001 and subsequently </p>
<p>FCO Political Director until July 2003, told the Inquiry that the Government’s view at this </p>
<p>time was that “containment policy was failing and the rate of failure was accelerating”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Peter set out the background to the review:</p>
<p>“We were very aware … that international support for this structure of sanctions and </p>
<p>deterrence was eroding, both in the region and in the Security Council. </p>
<p>“The net effect of that was that Saddam Hussein in Iraq was feeling pretty </p>
<p>comfortable. He had substantial illegal revenues from which he could pursue </p>
<p>patronage inside Iraq and continue the efforts to procure materials for his weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction programme. He was busy restoring his standing in the Arab </p>
<p>world by very visible support for the Palestinian intifada, which was another major </p>
<p>issue that was happening at that time.</p>
<p>“There were no inspectors in the country to inspect his weapons programme and </p>
<p>the US/UK sanctions policy was … unpopular. He was able to put the blame for the </p>
<p>suffering of the Iraqi people on the West. So our review of the policy … was really </p>
<p>designed to try to regain the initiative …”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The Inquiry heard different perspectives on the degree to which the policy of </p>
<p>containment was sustainable. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> Sir John Sawers, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs from January 1999 </p>
<p>to September 2001, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we [the UK Government] didn’t feel that our policy was failing; we felt that the </p>
<p>policy of containment we had in place was having a significant effect. That there </p>
<p>was still Iraqi activity, especially on chemical and biological elements, that was hard </p>
<p>to explain. We couldn’t get our UN inspectors in place … But the main concern was </p>
<p>the costs of our policy in the wider Arab world and international opinion and the </p>
<p>vulnerability we faced in terms of the monitoring of the No-Fly Zones.”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff from 1997 to 2007, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>“Containment was dying in 2001”, and that:</p>
<p>“The reason, in 2001, that people were looking at smart sanctions was because </p>
<p>sanctions weren’t working. They were hurting the wrong people. People were really </p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 11 October 2000: ‘Iraq after Saddam’ </b></p>
<p>On 11 October, at No.10’s request, and in the context of (unsubstantiated) reports that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was seriously ill, the JIC assessed the prospects for Iraq after Saddam’s </p>
<p>death.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The JIC stated that any new regime was unlikely to be radically different. Strategic </p>
<p>considerations and political, economic and commercial interests would produce strong </p>
<p>pressure for an early and widespread end to Iraq’s isolation. Iraq’s political rehabilitation </p>
<p>could be rapid, “overwhelming any voices of caution from London, Washington or </p>
<p>elsewhere”. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> Mr Alan Goulty, FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, sent a draft discussion </p>
<p>paper, entitled ‘Iraq: Future Strategy’, to Mr McKane on 20 October.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>26. </b> The draft paper defined the UK’s objectives as “to limit Saddam’s ability to </p>
<p>re-arm and develop WMD, and to reduce the threat Iraq poses to its neighbours”. Full </p>
<p>implementation of resolution 1284 remained the best means to achieve that, but the </p>
<p>resolution’s “shelf life” was limited. Without progress by summer 2001, it was likely to </p>
<p>lose credibility. If Iraq was to be persuaded to comply with the resolution, it needed  </p>
<p>to be convinced that the resolution offered “something new” and that, if it complied,  </p>
<p>the UN would suspend and eventually lift sanctions. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> The draft paper stated that the US had been “reluctant to contemplate lifting of </p>
<p>sanctions as long as Saddam remains in power” and that there was a “perception that </p>
<p>the US is less than wholly committed to implementation of SCR 1284 and the concept of </p>
<p>suspension of sanctions, thus undermining the credibility of the approach”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The draft paper recommended an early approach to a new US Administration. Both </p>
<p>US Presidential candidates had limited their freedom of movement by stressing that  </p>
<p>they wanted to see sanctions tightened. The UK’s “pitch” should be that implementation </p>
<p>of resolution 1284 best served US and UK interests, and that the status quo was  </p>
<p>not sustainable: </p>
<p>“Support for the UK/US approach is diminishing. Our position in the Security Council </p>
<p>is weakening over time … UK/US policy remains deeply unpopular at street level. </p>
<p>No matter how big the ‘Oil-for-Food’ programme may become, it is cumbersome </p>
<p>and bureaucratic and will never be able to redress the deterioration of Iraq’s </p>
<p>infrastructure, the impoverishment of the middle classes and the stifling of normal </p>
<p>economic activity. For as long as sanctions remain in place, responsibility for the </p>
<p>humanitarian situation will be ascribed to the US and the UK.”</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The draft paper concluded:</p>
<p>“Containment, but a looser version, remains the best option for achieving our policy </p>
<p>objectives towards Iraq. International support is vital if this is to be sustained.  </p>
<p>SCR 1284 delivered the balanced package envisaged in the May 1999 DOP paper. </p>
<p>Need for some tactical adjustments to make policy sustainable in the medium </p>
<p>term. Adjustments to the southern NFZ will be a key element. The US need to be </p>
<p>convinced that we are better served with UNMOVIC [UN Monitoring, Verification  </p>
<p>and Inspection Commission] inside Iraq with sanctions suspended than by the  </p>
<p>status quo. Other alternatives remain unattractive at this stage.”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The draft paper considered other strategic options, including “regime overthrow”. It </p>
<p>stated that this option “would command no useful international support” and commented: </p>
<p>“The US support for overthrow allows Iraq to claim with some justification that there </p>
<p>is no point in complying with the SCRs as the US will never lift sanctions while </p>
<p>Saddam remains in power.”</p>
<p><b>31. </b> The draft paper also set out the difficulties in sustaining the NFZs: </p>
<p>“Elements both here and in the US Government consider the zones largely </p>
<p>ineffective, dangerous and presentationally damaging. Our legal basis is tenuous </p>
<p>and we run the risk of a case against us at the ICJ [International Court of Justice].  </p>
<p>It is also inconceivable that Iraq will accept UNMOVIC [inspections] without a  </p>
<p>deal on the NFZs. </p>
<p>“There are grounds unconnected with implementation of [resolution] 1284 to </p>
<p>consider with the US withdrawing from the southern NFZ. But we could not avoid </p>
<p>the charge that this was a retreat, unless it could be presented as being in response </p>
<p>to a positive gesture from Iraq … Otherwise, we would justify it on the grounds that </p>
<p>UNMOVIC would not be able to operate safely and effectively in Iraq if the current </p>
<p>level of confrontation was maintained; that we had other means of monitoring the </p>

<p>1.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September 2000 to September 2001</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>situation on the ground; and that, in the event of evidence of renewed oppression </p>
<p>of the Shia, we would resume patrolling (although, in reality, this is most unlikely). </p>
<p>We should maintain enforcement of the northern NFZ as a sign of our continued </p>
<p>commitment to the Kurds … </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Abandoning the SNFZ [southern NFZ] would be unpopular with the Kuwaitis who </p>
<p>have come to regard it as vital for their defence. We would need to reassure them </p>
<p>that we had other equally effective ways to fulfil our commitment to their defence and </p>
<p>the containment of Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Simon Webb, MOD Director General Operational Policy, offered his comments </p>
<p>on the draft paper in a letter to Mr McKane on 30 October.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> He suggested that the </p>
<p>Government needed to consider whether the conclusions agreed by DOP in 1999 </p>
<p>“remained extant”. Mr Webb stated that he was “sceptical about Saddam’s susceptibility </p>
<p>to inducements” and suggested that:</p>
<p>“A surer foundation would be to re-assess our strategic objectives for Iraq in a </p>
<p>regional context, and then look imaginatively at the options – military but also  </p>
<p>others – for achieving them.” </p>
<p><b>33. </b> The Cabinet Office chaired a meeting to discuss the draft paper on 31 October.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Officials concluded that the UK’s policy objectives had not changed but that a new  </p>
<p>US Administration was likely to review its position, starting from “a blank piece of  </p>
<p>paper”. In preparing to engage with the US, the UK should itself take a fresh look  </p>
<p>at possible approaches. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> Officials commissioned a revised paper covering the wider context and the different </p>
<p>options, including their military dimensions, setting out their advantages, disadvantages, </p>
<p>opportunities and risks. The revised paper would inform discussions with the US. </p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 1 November 2000: ‘Iraq: Prospects for Co-operation’</b></p>
<p><b>35. </b> On 1 November, with the US Presidential elections imminent, the JIC assessed </p>
<p>the prospects for Iraq co-operating with resolution 1284.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> The JIC had judged in early </p>
<p>2000 that Saddam Hussein was unlikely to co-operate with resolution 1284 and allow </p>
<p>inspectors back into Iraq until after those elections.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The JIC stated that the elements of resolution 1284 which were favourable to Iraq, </p>
<p>such as abolishing the ceiling on approved oil exports and increasing the humanitarian </p>
<p>programme, had been implemented. But Iraq continued publicly to reject the resolution </p>
<p>and UNMOVIC. Unless UNMOVIC inspectors were allowed into Iraq, there could be no </p>

<p>progress towards lifting UN sanctions. The JIC stated that it had little direct intelligence </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein’s thinking. It assessed that Saddam Hussein was “content to drag </p>
<p>out any decision for as long as possible – at least until after the US election – he wants </p>
<p>to see if the West will make a better offer”. </p>
<p><b>37. </b> The JIC stated that Saddam had “<b>good reason to remain intransigent in 2001</b>”. </p>
<p><b>38. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein felt “<b>little pressure to negotiate</b>”, because the proceeds of </p>
<p>oil smuggling and illegal trade had “increased significantly this year” and more </p>
<p>countries were “increasing diplomatic contacts and trade”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein still wanted “UN sanctions lifted in due course, especially to </p>
<p>reverse the decline in Iraq’s military capability”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A message from Mr Cook on 1 September to his Arab counterparts, which </p>
<p>reminded them that if inspectors were allowed into Iraq sanctions could be </p>
<p>suspended within six months, had been interpreted by Iraqi and other officials, </p>
<p>and the UN Secretary General, “as a potential precursor to the <b>UK offering </b></p>
<p><b>fresh ideas </b>which could be put to the US after the Presidential election. Even </p>
<p>if this came to nought, Saddam would hope to see a gap open up between </p>
<p>Washington and London.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would “only contemplate co-operation with [resolution] 1284, </p>
<p>and the return of inspectors to Iraq, if it could be portrayed as a victory”. He </p>
<p>would not agree to co-operate unless: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>there was a “<b>UN-agreed timetable for the lifting of sanctions</b>. Saddam </p>
<p>suspects that the US would not agree to sanctions lift while he remained in </p>
<p>power”; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>he was “able <b>to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the </b></p>
<p><b>inspection provisions</b>. His ambitions to rebuild Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction programmes makes him hostile to intrusive inspections or any </p>
<p>other constraints likely to be effective.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Before accepting resolution 1284, Saddam Hussein would “try to obtain the </p>
<p><b>abolition of the No-Fly Zones</b>. He is also likely to demand that the US should </p>
<p>abandon its stated aim to topple the Iraqi Government.” </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Mr Blair told Parliament on 1 November:</p>
<p>“We believe that the sanctions regime has effectively contained Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>in the last 10 years. During this time he has not attacked his neighbours, nor used </p>
<p>chemical weapons against his own people.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The US Presidential election was held on 7 November. The result was not declared </p>

<p>199</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Mr Goulty sent a revised paper, entitled ‘Iraq: Options Paper’, to Mr McKane on </p>
<p>15 November.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>42. </b> The paper stated that sanctions were “fraying at the edges”. Since the breach of </p>
<p>the embargo on civilian flights on 22 September, over 40 civilian flights had landed in </p>
<p>Baghdad “signalling to some the end of Saddam’s isolation”. Saddam Hussein’s income </p>
<p>from “sanctions busting” was “an all-time high” of around US$1.5bn a year. Saddam </p>
<p>believed that the situation was developing in his favour and was under no immediate </p>
<p>pressure to resume co-operation with the UN. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> The paper considered the advantages and disadvantages of seven policy options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regime overthrow by supporting external and internal Iraqi opposition groups;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Hard” containment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing with the present policy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Soft” containment (a range of possibilities such as suspending sanctions and </p>
<p>abandoning the southern NFZ);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lifting sanctions (except those relating to arms and WMD);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lifting sanctions plus regime overthrow by supporting external and internal Iraqi </p>
<p>opposition groups; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Military action/lift sanctions”; the US and UK would conduct a bombing </p>
<p>campaign, “declare that this has achieved our disarmament objectives”, then lift </p>
<p>sanctions. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Mr Goulty advised that the paper contained no conclusions, given its primary </p>
<p>purpose of providing background for discussions with the US.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The Cabinet Office chaired a meeting to discuss the revised paper.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> Summarising </p>
<p>the main points of the discussion in a letter to Mr Goulty, Mr McKane stated that, with </p>
<p>regard to Iraqi WMD:</p>
<p>“Our current objective is to eliminate Saddam’s existing capabilities, and constrain </p>
<p>his ability to reconstitute them. Although this appears anomalous in the context of </p>
<p>our approach to other proliferators in the region, Iraq merits special treatment both </p>
<p>because of its proven willingness to use WMD, and because of the requirement that </p>
<p>the UN has placed upon it. This is the answer to the accusation of double standards.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“If UNMOVIC ever gets back into Iraq, that will not be the end of the story. If </p>
<p>UNMOVIC does its job properly, Iraq will presumably try to obstruct it and sooner or </p>
<p>later there will be an UNSCOM-style [UN Special Commission] confrontation. Unless </p>
<p>we want to leave Saddam’s finger on the trigger, we should not regard UNMOVIC as </p>
<p>a long-term solution.”</p>

<p>200</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr McKane also reported that the term “overthrow” was being interpreted in different </p>
<p>ways. The “more muscular variants” appeared impractical. At the other end of the </p>
<p>spectrum could be a “more rhetorical approach”, focusing international attention on the </p>
<p>behaviour of Saddam Hussein’s regime. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> Mr McKane set out the actions agreed at the meeting, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD would look at “military alternatives to the NFZs that still meet our </p>
<p>fundamental objectives”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the FCO would prepare briefing for Ministers and senior officials for initial </p>
<p>contacts with the new US team. That should not “prescribe options, but stress </p>
<p>that we remain shoulder to shoulder with the US in tackling the problem and are </p>
<p>willing to discuss with an open mind how best to achieve our objectives”; and</p>

<p><b>to improve, driven by trade and political factors. </b></p>
<p><b>49. </b> On 23 November, at No.10’s request, the JIC assessed developments in Iraq’s </p>
<p>regional relations.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>50. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “<b>exploiting the crisis in Israel</b> and the Occupied </p>
<p>Territories <b>to improve Iraq’s relations with the Arab and Islamic world </b>… </p>
<p>many Arab leaders now see revived relations with Iraq as a justified response  </p>
<p>to <b>perceived bias by Washington towards Israel and double standards on </b></p>
<p><b>UN resolution</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Most Arab countries now believed that “<b>economic sanctions against Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>should be lifted</b>. But the Gulf States in particular are afraid of Saddam’s </p>
<p>ambitions and will want military sanctions to continue while he remains  </p>
<p>in power.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Commercial ties between Syria and Iraq had “gathered pace this year. Oil </p>
<p>smuggling and illegal trade is likely to increase further.” Syria would “remain </p>
<p>cautious about forging closer political and military ties with Saddam”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Jordan and Egypt believed that “Iraq’s isolation … is at an end” and both were </p>
<p>“<b>likely to increase contacts and trade with Iraq</b>”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p> <b>Kuwait </b>would “not revive its relations with Baghdad while Saddam remains </p>
<p>in power”. With the exception of Kuwait, all Gulf states were “likely to face </p>
<p><b>pressure for a further warming of relations with Baghdad</b>, especially if the </p>
<p>crisis in Israel continues …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Relations between Iraq and Iran were “<b>unlikely to change dramatically</b>”. </p>

<p>1.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September 2000 to September 2001</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>51. </b> The JIC stated that “Arab rapprochement with Iraq” was “being driven by trade </p>
<p>and political factors over which the UK has little or no control”. The implication of that </p>
<p>rapprochement was that there was less pressure on Iraq to comply with UN resolutions. </p>
<p><b>52.  Mr Blair told officials that his preference was to link a shift on sanctions with </b></p>
<p><b>the return of inspectors to Iraq, and asked Mr Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, </b></p>
<p><b>for his advice on the approach to adopt with the US. </b></p>
<p><b>53. </b> On 24 November, Mr Sawers wrote to Mr Blair advising:</p>
<p>“We face problems ahead on Iraq. Among the Arabs, only Kuwait sees Saddam as a </p>
<p>real threat. Support for economic sanctions is weakening: many Arab countries see </p>
<p>it as ‘punishment’ and think ten years is enough. And Arab perceptions of US and </p>
<p>British support for Israel in the Palestinian crisis is accelerating the breakdown of the </p>
<p>sanctions regime. We have been looking at the policy options, but there are no easy </p>
<p>alternatives.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Mr Sawers listed examples of “sanctions fatigue” and stated:</p>
<p>“Whether it is Bush or Gore, the incoming US Administration will look again at Iraq </p>
<p>policy. Their first instinct will be to toughen, not weaken, the US approach and seek </p>
<p>Saddam’s ouster. But short of invading Iraq, that is unlikely … The US may also </p>
<p>choose to view Iraq in the wider proliferation context, thus linking it with Iran, rather </p>
<p>than as sui generis.”</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Mr Sawers identified the issues the UK should consider:</p>
<p>“i. </p>
<p>What is our view on continuing economic sanctions?</p>
<p>ii. </p>
<p>Should a shift on sanctions be linked with a return of the inspectors? … </p>
<p>But if UNMOVIC ever gets into Iraq, we will be back to the confrontations </p>
<p>we faced with UNSCOM, and Saddam’s finger will remain on the trigger. </p>
<p>iii. </p>
<p>Should we continue with the No-Fly Zones? … There is a tricky balance </p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>iv. </p>
<p>What posture should we adopt on these issues with the incoming </p>
<p>American Administration? … I am inclined to raise these as questions, </p>
<p>and include other alternatives such as stepping up our efforts to overthrow </p>
<p>Saddam. We should go with ideas and concerns, not with a settled, </p>
<p>revised policy. That way we can take the Americans through the pros and </p>
<p>cons of all the options.” </p>
<p><b>56. </b> Mr Sawers continued: </p>
<p>“My own view is that we ought to use the arrival of a new Administration to put Iraq </p>
<p>policy on a more sustainable footing. We do not want Saddam to develop WMD or </p>

<p>threaten his neighbours. But nor do we want sanctions to just erode away, or allow </p>
<p>Saddam to trigger recurring crises over the next five years. That argues for scaling </p>
<p>back to targeted sanctions, while suspending broader economic sanctions; keeping </p>
<p>control of oil revenues; and finding a way out of patrolling the southern NFZ.”</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Mr Sawers also sent Mr Blair the JIC Assessment on developments in Iraq’s </p>
<p>regional relations. Mr Sawers described it as providing “useful background” on how </p>
<p>events were “combining to ease the pressure on Iraq and make it more difficult for us”. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It wasn’t absolutely clear whether UNMOVIC’s return to Iraq was desirable because </p>
<p>it could have provoked another confrontation … there wasn’t any great confidence </p>
<p>that UNMOVIC would be any more successful than UNSCOM had been.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“There was no change in Iraqi attitudes, there was no readiness, really, on the Iraqi </p>
<p>side to co-operate with the United Nations and we didn’t think that we could force </p>
<p>Saddam through military action to accept an inspections regime.”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Blair commented on Mr Sawers’ minute:</p>
<p>“My<i> </i>firm view is option (ii) [linking a shift on sanctions with the return of inspectors]. </p>
<p>It puts sanctions to rest; gets inspectors back in and even if he [Saddam Hussein] </p>
<p>plays around, at least it’s obvious. But Iraq policy is going nowhere at present and </p>
<p>I am genuinely appalled by the human consequences<i>.</i>”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr McKane responded to Mr Sawers’ minute on 27 November, asking if there </p>
<p>was “one further policy option”, of “dismissing” any thought of moving UNMOVIC into </p>
<p>Iraq and instead working to enforce sanctions.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> On the question of whether a shift on </p>
<p>sanctions should be linked with the return of inspectors, Mr McKane commented that an </p>
<p>inspection regime would not be a stable, long-term solution but it would help to justify </p>
<p>publicly the suspension of sanctions.</p>

<p>“The preferred option by far would be to implement SCR 1284, enabling the inspectors </p>
<p>to return and sanctions to be suspended. But there does not seem to be much </p>
<p>prospect of that happening any time soon. Meanwhile the human consequences of </p>
<p>economic sanctions are pretty appalling, which is bad in itself and it gives critics an </p>
<p>easy point of attack; and the pressures on Saddam are not that great.” </p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Sawers stated that work was under way to review the policy options, in advance </p>
<p>of discussions with the new US Administration. Mr Blair would welcome:</p>
<p>“… the Foreign Secretary’s views on the approach we should adopt, bearing in mind </p>
<p>that the first instinct of a new [US] Administration will be to seek ways to unseat </p>
<p>Saddam rather than to accommodate him”. </p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 1 December 2000:  </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq’s Military Capabilities’</b></p>
<p>On 1 December, at the request of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec)  </p>
<p>and in response to the inter-departmental policy review on Iraq, the JIC assessed Iraq’s </p>
<p>military capabilities.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The JIC Assessment of Iraq’s ballistic missile and WMD capabilities, including whether </p>
<p>they constituted a residual threat, is set out in Section 4.1. The JIC Assessment of the </p>
<p>threat that Iraq posed to its neighbours is set out below. </p>
<p>The JIC stated that Iraq had lost nearly half its military strength as a result of the Gulf </p>
<p>Conflict and the capability of what remains had “declined since 1991”. UN sanctions </p>
<p>had<b> </b>“<b>successfully prevented the procurement of new weapons systems</b>” and had </p>
<p>constrained equipment maintenance and repair. </p>
<p>The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “<b>military offensive outside Iraq’s borders would be limited </b>by shortfalls in </p>
<p>equipment and logistics”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“While <b>US/UK forces remain </b>deployed in the region and prepared to intervene </p>
<p>militarily,<b> an attack on Kuwait is very unlikely</b>. But <b>if the southern No-Fly </b></p>
<p><b>Zone and no-drive zone became defunct</b>, warning time for an attack would </p>
<p>shorten … Should deterrence fail, US/UK forces currently in the region might be </p>
<p>insufficient to defeat an Iraqi attack.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>If US and UK forces were withdrawn from the Gulf, and Saddam perceived  </b></p>
<p><b>that the west was no longer prepared to intervene militarily, he could try to  </b></p>
<p><b>re-take Kuwait. </b>In such circumstances he would succeed, <b>even with his </b></p>
<p><b>current force levels</b>.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>To rebuild its Armed Forces, Iraq would need military sanctions lifted. </b></p>
<p>This is unlikely while Saddam remains in power. But if it happened, it would take </p>
<p>several years at least before Iraq’s capabilities increased to a level which would </p>
<p>alter significantly the military balance in the region.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>The JIC stated that, while there would be competing demands for resources if sanctions </p>
<p>were lifted, “Saddam and any likely successor are likely to give <b>high priority</b>” to </p>
<p>“<b>restoring military capability</b>”. The JIC continued: </p>
<p>“It would take comparatively less investment to revive some of Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes. Although Saddam is unlikely to use such weapons, their development </p>
<p>as a means of coercive diplomacy would give him an additional political tool to use in </p>
<p>his attempts to re-establish his regional and international standing.”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassader to the US from 1997 to 2003, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that, on 6 December 2000, he met Dr Condoleezza Rice and, separately, </p>
<p>Mr Karl Rove to discuss the priorities of the new US Administration.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> Dr Rice would </p>
<p>become President Bush’s National Security Advisor and Mr Rove would become one of </p>
<p>President Bush’s Senior Advisors. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> Sir Christopher told the Inquiry that nuclear missile defence was at the top </p>
<p>of the US list of priorities, with Iraq and the wider Middle East some way down. </p>
<p>Sir Christopher described the US position on Iraq as:</p>
<p>“We need to look at this. Things aren’t going well. The policy of sanctions is  </p>
<p>in tatters, the smuggling, Saddam is getting away with blue murder. We need  </p>
<p>to do something …”</p>
<p><b>66.  Mr Cook agreed with Mr Blair that full implementation of resolution 1284 </b></p>
<p><b>remained the UK’s best option and suggested that the UK should support  </b></p>
<p><b>efforts to clarify the ambiguities in the resolution concerning the process for </b></p>
<p><b>lifting sanctions. </b></p>
<p><b>67. </b> Mr Cook’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Sawers on 15 December, setting out </p>
<p>Mr Cook’s views.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> Mr Cook agreed that full implementation of resolution 1284 </p>
<p>remained “the best means of pursuing the UK’s policy objectives”. It would restore  </p>
<p>in-country control over Iraq’s WMD programmes, “get us off the hook of responsibility </p>
<p>for the humanitarian situation”, and provide Iraq and the UK with an exit route  </p>
<p>from sanctions. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> The “shelf life” of the resolution, however, was limited. </p>
<p><b>69. </b> If Iraq was to be persuaded to comply with resolution 1284, it was “now clear that </p>
<p>this will require the elaboration of a package of measures which is sufficiently attractive </p>
<p>to lure the Iraqis in”. France had recently proposed that the P5 should begin to clarify </p>
<p>the “ambiguities” in resolution 1284, in particular those concerning the process for </p>
<p>lifting sanctions. The timing was not ideal (between US Administrations), but a package </p>
<p>that had the support of the P5 would be hard for Iraq to ignore. Reaching agreement </p>

<p>1.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September 2000 to September 2001</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>within the P5 on a package of measures would “require some painful adjustments for </p>
<p>ourselves and, even more so, for the Americans”. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> The new US Administration was expected to carry out a full policy review.  </p>
<p>Mr Cook advised:</p>
<p>“We need to get in early and be prepared to press them hard. Their first instincts </p>
<p>will be to look at tougher measures e.g. tighter sanctions, military action, greater </p>
<p>emphasis on regime overthrow. None of these will have any credible support. Our </p>
<p>pitch should be to persuade the US of the unattractiveness of these options and </p>
<p>then convince them that SCR 1284 best serves our interests.”</p>
<p><b>71. </b> On Mr Blair’s concerns over the humanitarian situation, Mr Cook advised:</p>
<p>“With the ‘Oil-for-Food’ programme likely to be worth US$16bn this year, the </p>
<p>situation on the ground is starting to improve. This has taken some of the sting out </p>
<p>of the anti-sanctions campaign. But no matter how big the ‘Oil-for-Food’ programme </p>
<p>may become, it is cumbersome and bureaucratic and relies on Iraqi co-operation. </p>
<p>It will never be able to redress the deterioration of Iraq’s infrastructure, the </p>
<p>impoverishment of the middle classes, and the stifling of normal economic activity.” </p>
<p><b>72. </b> Mr Cook concluded: </p>
<p>“Containment through implementation of SCR 1284 remains the best option for now. </p>
<p>To make this achievable we will need to convince the US that this best serves our </p>
<p>objectives and that we should work to agree an implementation package which will </p>
<p>unite the P5. The status quo is unsustainable and other options are unattractive.”</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Mr Ross told the Inquiry that the “ambiguities” referred to by Mr Cook related to the </p>
<p>final operative paragraphs of resolution 1284, which were “very complicated and … set </p>
<p>out a really tortuous route of how the inspectors go back in”.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Ross commented that, although the UK was “quite happy with that rather </p>
<p>tortured route”, it wanted P5 unity and “if the Russians and French said they wanted … </p>
<p>clarification, then we were prepared to have that discussion”. </p>
<p><b>Initial discussions with the new US Administration</b></p>
<p><b>75. </b> According to published US accounts, Iraq was not seen as one of the highest </p>
<p>priorities for the incoming Bush Administration.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>76. </b> As Section 1.1 describes, a number of senior US politicians had been calling for </p>
<p>tougher action on Iraq since 1998. Some of those politicians became senior members  </p>
<p>of President Bush’s team. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Sir William Patey, Head of the FCO’s Middle East Department from 1999 to March </p>
<p>2002, told the Inquiry that he was aware of “drumbeats” from voices in Washington who </p>
<p>were talking about the possibility of regime change and arming Iraqi opposition groups, </p>
<p>but that the UK’s policy was “to stay away from that end of the spectrum”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that “regime overthrow was … mentioned [by US </p>
<p>interlocutors] but it was quite clear that there was no proposition being put in our </p>
<p>direction … about regime change”.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>79. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York </p>
<p>from 1998 to July 2003, wrote in his statement to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“For all the rumbling in the background, Iraq did not appear to be at the top end of </p>
<p>the new Administration’s list of priorities in those early Bush months.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell and Mr Sawers visited Washington on 14 January, where they </p>
<p>met several members of President Bush’s team, including Dr Rice.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>81. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that Dr Rice had been “critical of the Clinton </p>
<p>Administration’s policy of talking tough but actually acting rather weakly and she </p>
<p>included Iraq in that criticism”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> His impression was of a US Administration which would </p>
<p>“take a hard edged approach but would nonetheless want to work with the United </p>
<p>Kingdom”, and whose main concerns would be domestic:</p>
<p>“The issues about tax cuts and prescription drugs and social security reform were </p>
<p>very much uppermost in the minds at the top of the [US] Administration rather than </p>
<p>any specific foreign policy issue, apart from missile defence.” </p>
<p><b>82. </b> President Bush was inaugurated on 20 January. </p>
<p><b>83. </b> In late January, the FCO’s Middle East Department produced a paper which </p>
<p>reassessed the UK’s “fundamental interests” in relation to Iraq and recommended a new </p>
<p>approach to promoting them.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> The UK’s interests included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regional stability, including through the non-proliferation of WMD;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preserving the credibility and authority of the Security Council; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining the coherence of UK policy, including on human rights, adherence to </p>
<p>resolutions and non-proliferation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving the humanitarian and human rights situation in Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>avoiding a US/UK split; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reducing the UK’s isolation in the EU. </p>

<p><b>84. </b> The paper identified the UK’s aims for Iraq and the Gulf Region and concluded  </p>
<p>that a number of them were “unachievable” while Saddam Hussein’s regime remained  </p>
<p>in power. </p>
<p><b>85. </b> The paper recommended that “Plan A” should be to persuade the US that full </p>
<p>implementation of resolution 1284 best served US/UK interests. </p>
<p><b>86. </b> If Iraq rejected that, the medium-term “Plan B” should be to restrict sanctions to </p>
<p>arms, persuade Iraq’s neighbours to enforce them more rigorously, end the Oil-for-Food </p>
<p>(OFF) programme in “Baghdad-controlled Iraq”, increase support to the Iraqi opposition, </p>
<p>impose a travel ban and assets freeze on Saddam Hussein and his regime, and pursue </p>
<p>the indictment of Saddam Hussein for war crimes. That would be presented as targeting </p>
<p>policy more directly at his regime.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock called on Mr Cook on 29 January.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> On Iraq, Mr Cook  </p>
<p>stated that: </p>
<p>“… we were at stalemate, and the situation was deteriorating … We had to find </p>
<p>a means of sustaining our policy on WMD, but in a way that had a degree of </p>
<p>international support and would be adhered to in the region … A more focused form </p>
<p>of sanctions was needed.” </p>
<p><b>88. </b> Mr Cook said that he would discuss Iraq with Mr Colin Powell, the new US Secretary </p>
<p>of State, during his forthcoming visit to Washington. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> Sir Jeremy responded that the UK should try to get the US to focus on stopping oil </p>
<p>smuggling from Iraq. Mr Cook agreed. </p>
<p><b>90.  Mr Cook visited Washington from 5 to 7 February. </b></p>
<p><b>91. </b> In a briefing telegram for the visit, officials at the British Embassy Washington </p>
<p>advised that the new US Administration believed the current position on Iraq was </p>
<p>“unsustainable”.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> It wanted a “new approach to more effective containment which can </p>
<p>be sold in the region as enlightened and at home as tougher”. </p>
<p><b>92. </b> The Embassy also advised that Iraq had been “at the top of [Secretary] Powell’s </p>
<p>pile”; the State Department, Department of Defense and the White House had been </p>
<p>working intensively to put up advice on policy options.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the  </p>
<p>US Defense Secretary, and his Deputy, Mr Paul Wolfowitz, would incline towards more </p>
<p>vigorous action to topple Saddam Hussein. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>93. </b> The Embassy highlighted the scale of US scepticism about the effectiveness </p>
<p>of weapons inspectors and the concept of “narrower and deeper” sanctions.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Any </p>
<p>agreement on easing sanctions would need to retain essential controls. The UK should </p>
<p>persuade the US to agree to elaborate those controls “now, in a package that will bring </p>
<p>the P5 back on board, and thus increase pressure on Saddam”. Simultaneously  </p>
<p>cracking down on smuggling would “tighten sanctions and squeeze the regime”.  </p>
<p>That would “require a lot of political will and creative solutions”, but would show  </p>
<p>that the UK was serious. </p>
<p><b>94. </b> The FCO’s briefing for Mr Cook stated that the objectives of the visit were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“to reach broad UK/US agreement on a new joint approach and agree to early </p>
<p>talks at official level before an inter-agency approach has been agreed in </p>
<p>Washington”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“to underline the importance of reaching P5 agreement on Iraq and broadening </p>
<p>regional support for UK/US policy.”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The FCO advised:</p>
<p>“International support for our approach is fading fast. Divisions in the P5 and the </p>
<p>collapse of the MEPP [Middle East Peace Process] have made key regional allies </p>
<p>more uncomfortable with our current policy. We are increasingly isolated in the </p>
<p>EU. We are held responsible for the suffering in Iraq, while memories of Saddam’s </p>
<p>brutality fade … </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Until Saddam goes we need to work for sustainable containment, focusing  </p>
<p>on WMD, through implementation of SCR 1284. This means a mixture of stick  </p>
<p>and carrot …” </p>

<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Westmacott proposed that the UK’s aim should be to reach agreement on a “new, </p>
<p>integrated approach” which offered “additional lures to Iraq to comply with [resolution] </p>
<p>1284”, but also increased “the cost to the regime of not doing so”, while “getting the </p>

<p><b>97. </b> Devising such a package should allow P5 unity to be restored, but was likely to </p>
<p>mean persuading the US “that some of their ideas for punishing/over-throwing Saddam </p>
<p>will have to be kept in reserve for now”. </p>
<p><b>98. </b> Mr Westmacott offered a number of detailed suggestions for this package, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new, concerted effort to address oil smuggling;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>elaboration of how controls over oil revenues and imports could be relaxed after </p>
<p>the suspension of sanctions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>narrower and deeper sanctions, for as long as Iraq did not comply with </p>
<p>resolution 1284; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>incorporation of the NFZs into the package “on the basis of regional security </p>
<p>needs … as well as humanitarian protection”. That would be useful “given the </p>
<p>problems at the London end over the maintenance of NFZ aerial patrols”. </p>
<p><b>99. </b> Mr Westmacott stated that such a package would require a new resolution, and </p>
<p>commented: </p>
<p>“But the best chance of getting agreement to a new resolution would lie in </p>
<p>retaining [resolution] 1284 as the basis of the revised approach. The package itself </p>
<p>nonetheless needs to be crafted in the expectation that Saddam will not comply.  </p>
<p>So it needs to be forthcoming enough to command P5 support but firm enough  </p>
<p>to remain relevant in the likely event that the carrots it contains fail to deliver  </p>
<p>Iraqi compliance.” </p>
<p><b>100. </b> Mr Peter Gooderham, Counsellor in the British Embassy Washington, wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Westmacott on 5 February to report on Mr Cook’s “briefing supper” in Washington.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Cook had told officials that:</p>
<p>“… [resolution] 1284 was no longer sustainable. It made sense, not least in </p>
<p>UNSC-handling terms, to keep it on the table … we should accept that Saddam </p>
<p>had no intention of complying with it. We should give up, therefore, the effort to get </p>
<p>inspectors back into Iraq, and embark instead on a set of policies which did not </p>
<p>depend on Iraqi co-operation for their sustainability.” </p>
<p><b>101. </b> Mr Cook had outlined a new package, comprising:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>targeting sanctions at military and dual-use items: that would mean the  </p>
<p>US taking a less restrictive approach on contract “holds”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>keeping financial controls in place, but seeking ways of facilitating the </p>

<p><b>103. </b> In a manuscript comment on Mr Gooderham’s letter, Sir John Kerr, FCO </p>
<p>Permanent Under Secretary, suggested to Mr Westmacott that the policy outlined by  </p>
<p>Mr Cook was unlikely to “survive in the cold light of a Washington morning”.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> It seemed </p>
<p>a recipe for infuriating allies in the Gulf (due to the proposal to dispense with the </p>
<p>southern NFZ patrols) and would mean abandoning hope of P5 unity (because the </p>
<p>‘Contract with the Iraqi People’ suggested that the target was no longer the suspension </p>
<p>of sanctions if Iraq stopped developing WMD, but Saddam Hussein himself). Sir John </p>
<p>continued: “I much preferred the policy in your [Mr Westmacott’s] note. I wonder if he  </p>

<p>Washington reported that they had discussed the need to regain the initiative on Iraq </p>
<p>through a radical new approach to secure common objectives and to get the public </p>
<p>emphasis back on Iraq’s WMD, including by moving from a sanctions debate to an arms </p>
<p>control debate and narrowing the definition of dual-use items. </p>

<p>moving forward on sanctions is through ‘clarification’ of SCR 1284. An important </p>
<p>element of this would be elaboration of the post-suspension modalities. The French </p>

<p><b>Review of the No-Fly Zones (NFZs)</b></p>
<p><b>118. </b> Section 1.1 addresses the legal basis advanced by the UK for the creation and </p>
<p>continued operation of the NFZs in northern and southern Iraq, and for the response to </p>
<p>Iraqi attacks on aircraft enforcing the NFZs. </p>
<p><b>119. </b> Operations in the NFZs and the targets which UK aircraft were permitted to attack </p>
<p>were regularly reviewed and approved by Ministers. </p>
<p><b>Response Options (ROs)</b></p>
<p>The coalition established NFZs in the north and south of Iraq in 1991 and 1992 </p>
<p>respectively (see Section 1.1).</p>
<p>With the agreement of Ministers, operational commanders were allowed discretion to </p>
<p>respond in self-defence within the parameters of a number of graduated “Response </p>
<p>Options” (ROs) defined as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RO1 – immediate self-defence. An aircraft in the air responding immediately to an </p>
<p>Iraqi threat to it, or to another coalition asset, although not necessarily against the </p>
<p>specific system directly causing the threat.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RO2 – a coalition response against a pre-planned target to a threat during the </p>
<p>course of a subsequent patrol on the same day.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RO3 – a coalition response against a pre-planned target on the next </p>
<p>patrolling day.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>ROs 1 to 3 were dependent on there being a “triggering threat” in the form of a weapon </p>
<p>fired or a radar illumination. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RO5 – pre-emptive self-defence on the basis of demonstrated Iraqi hostile intent, </p>
<p>such as a pre-emptive operation against mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) </p>
<p>assets. RO5 was introduced to counter Iraqi tactics of threatening coalition aircraft </p>
<p>and then moving assets before coalition aircraft could respond. </p>
<p>Any proposal to carry out an attack that did not fall within the parameters defined within </p>
<p>ROs 1 to 3 and RO5 was classified RO4 and required Ministerial approval. </p>
<p>The agreed rules placed a limit on the number of targets that could be attacked in any </p>
<p>single response (six); and on the number of attacks that could be carried out within any </p>
<p>seven-day period (four). </p>
<p>From November 2000, the UK Commander was not authorised to commit to an RO attack </p>
<p>where civilian casualties were expected.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> By March 2001, UK forces no longer relied on </p>
<p>delegated authority in cases where the risk of collateral damage to civilian buildings was </p>
<p>considered higher than “low”.</p>

<p>213</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry that, throughout 2000, concern grew about </p>
<p>how long the NFZs could legally be sustained and about how to respond</p>
<p> </p>
<p>if an aircraft </p>
<p>was shot down.</p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 13 December 2000: ‘Impact of the NFZs on Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>Persecution’</b></p>
<p><b>121. </b> On 13 December 2000, at the request of Lord Williams of Mostyn, Attorney </p>
<p>General from 1999 to June 2001, and the FCO, the JIC assessed the persecution of </p>
<p>ethnic and religious communities in Iraq and how it was constrained by the NFZs.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>122. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime saw Iraq’s Kurds and Shia as a threat and </p>
<p>discriminated against them politically and in the allocation of resources. </p>
<p>Human rights abuses had extended to the use of military force. “Since 1991, </p>
<p><b>international monitoring and coalition enforcement of the NFZs had</b> </p>
<p><b>constrained but not prevented this persecution</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the north, Saddam Hussein wanted to regain full control of the Kurdish </p>
<p>Autonomous Zone. Iraq’s military forces were positioned to re-take the territory. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Abolition of the northern NFZ would weaken the US “red line” and have a major </p>
<p>impact on Kurdish confidence. “<b>Any resistance</b> [to a military assault by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein] <b>would be put down brutally and scores settled, inducing a refugee </b></p>
<p><b>crisis comparable to 1996</b>”. If the Kurds united to resist Saddam Hussein, a </p>
<p>full-scale attack to re-take the north would lead to a “<b>major humanitarian crisis </b></p>
<p><b>comparable to 1991</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the south, Saddam used his security forces “to destroy villages, assassinate </p>
<p>Shia clerics and execute suspects and their families”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the southern NFZ were withdrawn, Iraqi air power would be used “to enhance </p>
<p>operations now conducted by ground forces”. Such attacks would give Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein more military options and “<b>add to Shia misery</b>”. But Saddam did not </p>
<p>need to kill or injure more Shia to achieve his current objectives. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Wide international support at the creation of the NFZs in 1991-92 has faded, </p>
<p>especially since 1998. The NFZs are increasingly seen as an obstacle to </p>
<p>progress on Iraq at the UN. Iraqi propaganda is effective in falsifying and </p>
<p>exaggerating civilian casualties and collateral damage.” </p>
<p><b>123.  The JIC Assessment did not satisfactorily address all Lord Williams’ </b></p>
<p><b>questions. </b></p>

<p><b>125. </b> On 12 January 2001, in response to the November 2000 commission to look at </p>
<p>military alternatives to the NFZ (described earlier in this Section), Mr Webb wrote to </p>
<p>Mr McKane advising that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The elimination of Saddam Hussein’s WMD capabilities could not be achieved </p>
<p>without inspections. Air power alone would not be sufficient.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There might be scope for adjusting the northern NFZ, to limit patrolling to the </p>
<p>Kurdish Autonomous Zone only or to rely on patrolling within Turkish air space.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The picture was “rather different” in the South. The southern NFZ remained </p>
<p>justified on humanitarian grounds. More importantly, it was essential to the UK’s </p>
<p>objective of preventing Saddam Hussein from endangering regional stability by </p>
<p>threatening his southern neighbours.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>126. </b> On 17 January, Mr McKane chaired a meeting to discuss Iraq.</p>
<p>75 </p>
<p>Officials agreed </p>
<p>that the MOD should look at “possible options” for the southern NFZ with the US, </p>
<p>including reduced coalition patrols and responses and reliance on some form of “active </p>
<p>deterrence”. Officials also noted that Lord Williams was reviewing the legal justification </p>
<p>for the NFZs. </p>
<p><b>127. </b> Officials agreed that it would be necessary to draw together for Ministers the </p>
<p>various threads relating to Iraq, after progress had been made in discussions with  </p>
<p>the US. A further meeting was envisaged in “a month or so, subject to developments”.</p>

<p> Mr Patey advised that </p>
<p>the letter had been agreed with the MOD and the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p><b>129. </b> Mr Patey advised:</p>
<p>“Both the UK and US have made it clear to Iraq and publicly that we will take military </p>

<p>The US has in addition stated that they would take action if Iraq moved to attack the </p>
<p>Kurds. While we have not made the same explicit commitment, any Iraqi attack on </p>
<p>the Kurdish area … would be very difficult for the British Government to ignore. Our </p>
<p>interests … are likely to argue strongly in favour of a response. This would however </p>

<p>1.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September 2000 to September 2001</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>130. </b> The detailed work on whether there were alternative means of achieving UK </p>
<p>objectives in the NFZs, which had been undertaken in early 2000 and endorsed by </p>
<p>Ministers (see Section 1.1), had concluded that regular patrols of the NFZs:</p>
<p>“… afforded the most effective means of performing the mission at the lowest risk. </p>
<p>Work conducted in the context of the current review exercise has indicated that in </p>
<p>relation to the south this remains the case.” </p>
<p><b>131. </b> There might be scope for adjustment in the north but the “full implications” of the </p>
<p>options for that would “require further study”. Human rights monitors might provide a </p>
<p>means to monitor the situation on the ground. Successive resolutions had called on Iraq </p>
<p>to allow them entry but Iraq had refused. Mr Patey advised:</p>
<p>“In the longer term the best guarantee against attacks on the civilian population is a </p>
<p>change of regime and the establishment of a democratic government … It is difficult, </p>
<p>however, to envisage measures which directly lead to the overthrow of the current </p>
<p>regime which would also be consistent with international or domestic law.”</p>
<p><b>132. </b> It was “extremely difficult to verify” Iraqi claims that civilians had been killed or </p>
<p>injured as a result of coalition action in either NFZ. The UK could not “make any sensible </p>
<p>estimate of the number of people … who have been killed or injured as a result of </p>
<p>coalition action in self-defence since January 1999. What we do know is that the vast </p>
<p>majority of Iraqi claims are spurious, and that the actual number of civilians who have </p>
<p>been affected by coalition action is likely to be very much smaller than Baghdad would </p>
<p>have the world believe.”</p>
<p><b>133. </b> There was nothing to alter the JIC Assessment of 13 December 2000. Officials </p>
<p>were looking separately at whether there might be a justification for the existence of the </p>
<p>southern NFZ in terms of the defence of Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>134.  US proposals for a response to Iraqi military activity against aircraft </b></p>
<p><b>patrolling the southern NFZ highlighted the urgency of resolving the legal basis </b></p>
<p><b>for the NFZs.</b></p>
<p><b>135. </b> On 30 January, an FCO official invited Mr Cook to agree that the RAF should </p>
<p>participate in a US-led attack on five targets north of the 33rd parallel, outside the </p>
<p>southern NFZ, and a further target within the southern NFZ.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> UK aircraft were to attack </p>
<p>the target within the NFZ and provide cover for US aircraft involved in the attacks further </p>
<p>north. A UK tanker would be used to refuel US aircraft. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> The official reported the MOD’s assessment: improvements to the Iraqi air-defence </p>
<p>system (IADS), to provide secure links between early warning radars outside the </p>
<p>southern NFZ and missile and anti-aircraft artillery batteries within the NFZ, could  </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>“in a worst case scenario” reduce the warning of an approaching Iraqi missile to “as little </p>
<p>as five or six seconds”. </p>
<p><b>137. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry why the proposed attack was necessary.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> Iraqi </p>
<p>surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery contesting the NFZs had previously been </p>
<p>controlled by radars close to those weapon systems:</p>
<p>“What they [the Iraqi military] perfected was to move the radars back north of </p>
<p>33 degrees north … up around Baghdad, and then to provide information to the </p>
<p>surface-to-air missiles and the anti-aircraft artillery by fibre-optic links … </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“What that meant was that there was a risk that the aircraft would find themselves </p>
<p>patrolling, and suddenly, instead of being illuminated by a radar close to them that </p>
<p>they could identify, something much further back would be controlling a missile </p>
<p>which would suddenly come their way.</p>
<p>“This made the operation of considerably more risk …</p>
<p>“That target set was very, very carefully considered for, not only the basic legality, </p>
<p>but there were also questions about proportionality and risk to civilian casualties …”</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Lord Williams was briefed on the proposed attack by MOD and FCO officials on </p>
<p>30 January.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>139. </b> Later that day, Mr David Brummell, the Legal Secretary to the Law Officers, wrote </p>
<p>to Mr Martin Hemmings, the MOD Legal Adviser, recording that Lord Williams was </p>
<p>“satisfied that a proportionate attack on the target could … be justified in the context of </p>
<p>allied operations in the southern No-Fly Zone”.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> Mr Brummell wrote that Lord Williams </p>
<p>noted the:</p>
<p>“… assurance provided by FCO officials at today’s briefing meeting that without </p>
<p>the No-Fly Zones, they would be confident that further oppression would result </p>
<p>on a scale comparable to that which led to the grave humanitarian crisis and the </p>
<p>establishment of the Zones in 1991 and 1992. <b>In the absence of that categorical </b></p>

<p>this question.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>141. </b> On 1 February, Mr Goulty advised the Private Offices of Mr Cook and Sir John Kerr:</p>
<p>“The Attorney General has said he approves the target of a proposed US/UK attack </p>
<p>north of the southern No-Fly Zone … but only on the basis of a specific assurance </p>
<p>from the FCO, which we cannot honestly give. The JIC assessment of 13 December </p>
<p>2000 reflects our views, but the Attorney General regards this as insufficient. Our </p>
<p>failure to join in this attack would risk a major disagreement with the US on the eve </p>
<p>of the Foreign Secretary’s visit to Washington, and increase the threat to our pilots  </p>
<p>in the SNFZ. </p>
<p>“The Attorney General’s position on the target reflects his long-standing concerns </p>
<p>about the continued legality of the SNFZ, and his wish to revisit this question as </p>
<p>soon as possible.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>142. </b> Emphasising the urgency of the issue, Mr Goulty recommended:</p>
<p>“… that the Foreign Secretary speak to the Defence Secretary with the aim of a joint </p>
<p>approach to the Attorney General to persuade him to approve this target on political </p>
<p>and military grounds, without prejudice to his urgent re-examination of the legal </p>
<p>basis of the SNFZ. Legal Advisers concur.” </p>
<p><b>143. </b> Mr Goulty also advised that the Cabinet Office had been asked “to convene </p>
<p>urgently the official committee on Iraq to review what assessment might properly be </p>
<p>given to the Attorney General”. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> Sir John Kerr wrote to Mr Cook’s Private Office, endorsing Mr Goulty’s proposal </p>
<p>and commenting: </p>
<p>“I think the Dep[artmen]t, and the Legal Advisers, are right, on the wider issue of </p>
<p>the legality of the SNFZ, that we cannot allow the Attorney to put in our mouths a </p>
<p>‘categorical assurance’ … about which we can’t honestly be categorical. But he </p>
<p>knows what he’s doing: his motive is his concern to secure a real review of the basis </p>
<p>of the SNFZ. So I agree with the proposal for a Hoon/Cook approach, from which </p>
<p>he would get an undertaking that such a review would start forthwith, Hoon would </p>
<p>in exchange get the removal of an impossible condition on the AG’s authorisation of </p>
<p>the target, and the SofS [Secretary of State] would get the removal of the risk that, </p>

<p><b>147. </b> Mr Brummell concluded:</p>

<p>regarding the continuing operations by UK forces in the No-Fly Zones. He stresses </p>
<p>that in these circumstances it is absolutely imperative that he receives <b>at the very </b></p>
<p><b>earliest opportunity</b> a clear and definitive view, endorsed at the highest level, as to </p>
<p>the assessment of the humanitarian consequences that will ensue in the event that </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>152.  Mr McKane judged that the difficulty in providing the Attorney General with </b></p>
<p><b>the “clear and definitive assessment” he had requested was sufficiently important </b></p>
<p><b>to bring to the attention of the Cabinet Secretary.</b></p>
<p><b>153. </b> On 2 February, Mr McKane advised Sir Richard Wilson’s Private Office that it was </p>
<p>proving extremely difficult to provide the Attorney General with the “clear and definitive </p>
<p>assessment” that he had requested of the consequences of ceasing operations in the </p>
<p>southern NFZ.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Mr McKane stated that the consequences of having to cease operations would be </p>
<p>“very serious and far reaching, not only for the defence of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia but </p>
<p>also the transatlantic relationship”.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Hoon and Mr Brian Wilson, the newly appointed FCO Minister of State for the </p>
<p>Middle East, met Lord Williams on 5 February to discuss the issue. </p>
<p><b>156. </b> Mr Sawers advised Mr Blair on 7 February:</p>
<p>“We (including Geoff Hoon, and FCO and MOD officials) were close to satisfying the </p>
<p>Attorney’s concerns with a letter which showed that the northern and southern NFZs </p>
<p>were linked – if we stopped in the South, we would have difficulty persuading Turkey </p>
<p>to agree to continued patrols in the North; and that there was an unacceptably </p>
<p>high risk of humanitarian crisis (i.e. somewhere in Iraq) if we stopped patrolling </p>
<p>the southern NFZ. But Robin [Cook] has refused to endorse the argumentation, </p>
<p>and if the link between the two NFZs is removed, as he wishes, we are unlikely to </p>
<p>persuade Gareth [Lord Williams]. Our planes would then have to stop patrols [of the </p>
<p>southern NFZ] forthwith.”</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>157. </b> A meeting with Mr Cook and Mr Hoon had been arranged for the following day.  </p>
<p>In the meantime “enforcement action is on hold, and an already once-delayed strike  </p>
<p>has been put back a second time”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>“Given the demonstrated unpredictability of Saddam Hussein’s regime, it is </p>
<p>impossible to make definitive judgements capable of being ascribed [with] absolute </p>
<p>certainty when considering what might occur in any given hypothetical situation. The </p>
<p>recent JIC paper … [of 13 December 2000] reflects this uncertainty. But we can, </p>
<p>based on past experience and informed assessment of the nature of that regime, </p>
<p>arrive at assessments to which we attach a high degree of confidence.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Mr McKane repeated the JIC’s Assessment of the risks of withdrawing both the </p>
<p>southern and northern NFZs, and added:</p>
<p>“In the event that UK and US operations in the southern No-Fly Zone were to cease, </p>
<p>no one can predict with absolute certainty how Saddam Hussein would act or what </p>
<p>the consequences would be for the Shia population. Air power would give Saddam </p>
<p>more military options. He used air power, including helicopter gunships, against </p>
<p>the Shia population in 1991 and 1992. If the southern No-Fly Zone were lifted, he </p>
<p>would do so again. More effective persecution of the Shia would add to their misery, </p>
<p>and would risk provoking another cycle of uprising and brutal repression. A grave </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis would result …</p>
<p>“In addition, any judgement on the utility of the southern No-Fly Zone in preventing </p>
<p>a humanitarian disaster must take into account the likely impact on our ability to </p>
<p>prevent one in the north. We believe that, if UK and US operations in the southern </p>
<p>No-Fly Zone were to cease, it would be more difficult to sustain the necessary </p>
<p>political support for the northern No-Fly Zone …</p>
<p>“Our overall judgement remains that there is an unacceptably high risk that, in the </p>
<p>event that we cease patrolling the southern No-Fly Zone, extreme humanitarian </p>
<p>distress would result on a scale comparable to that which led to grave humanitarian </p>
<p>crisis and the establishment of the Zones in 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>“This assessment will be kept under review. The judgement it contains could change </p>
<p>if alternative arrangements for preventing further humanitarian catastrophe in Iraq </p>
<p>emerge from the review of policy … on which we and the US Government are now </p>
<p>embarked.” </p>
<p><b>161. </b> Lord Williams asked to see earlier drafts of the letter before responding.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>162.  The Attorney General concluded that it was still possible on balance to argue </b></p>
<p><b>that the maintenance of the NFZs was justified, although that argument was now </b></p>
<p><b>more questionable. </b></p>

<p>“… the Law Officers have previously accepted that a respectable legal argument that </p>
<p>force is justified on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity can be made if:</p>
<p>(a) there is convincing evidence, generally accepted by the international </p>
<p>community as a whole, of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale, </p>
<p>requiring immediate and urgent relief;</p>
<p>(b) it is objectively clear that there is, in all the circumstances, no practicable </p>
<p>alternative to the use of force if lives are to be saved; and</p>
<p>(c) the proposed use of force is both necessary and proportionate to the aim </p>
<p>being pursued (i.e. the relief of humanitarian need) and is strictly limited in time </p>
<p>and scope to that aim: that is to say, that it is the minimum necessary to achieve </p>
<p>that end.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>164. </b> Mr Brummell stated that Lord Williams had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted the assessments in the letters from Mr Patey and Mr McKane; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted that the assessment in relation to the southern NFZ appeared “weaker </p>
<p>than that provided in … January 2000”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted the statement in Mr McKane’s letter of 8 February, that “if UK and US </p>
<p>operations in the No-Fly Zones were to cease, it would be more difficult to </p>
<p>sustain the necessary political support for the northern No-Fly Zone”, but </p>
<p>considered it “questionable whether any weight may be attached to this in </p>
<p>considering the legal justification for the southern No-Fly Zone”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stressed that “every effort must be made to avoid incidental loss of civilian </p>
<p>life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects”. Given the difficulties in </p>
<p>assessing casualties, Lord Williams stressed that it was possible for him to </p>
<p>take a view on the legal justification of the NFZs only “on the understanding </p>
<p>that Ministers are satisfied that every effort is indeed made to avoid civilian </p>
<p>casualties”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted the “significant diminution of international support for the Zones, and </p>
<p>indeed in some cases overt criticism … in contrast to the wider consensus in </p>
<p>favour of the establishment of the Zones in 1991 and 1992”. </p>
<p><b>165. </b> Mr Brummell continued: </p>
<p>“Having regard to the above points the Attorney considers that it is now more </p>
<p>questionable whether a respectable legal argument can be maintained that force is </p>
<p>justified on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity. However, on the basis </p>
<p>of the assurances set out in your [Mr McKane’s] letter of 8 February the Attorney </p>
<p>accepts that it is still <b>possible</b> on balance to argue that the maintenance of the </p>
<p>No-Fly Zones is justified as a necessary and proportionate use of force to prevent a </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis. He stresses that the judgement as to whether such an argument </p>
<p>can still be advanced is a very fine one.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>“The Attorney reiterates that such a legal basis for the existence of the Zones cannot </p>
<p>justify military action for other, ulterior motives such as action to punish Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein, or to enforce other UK or US objectives such as the maintenance of the </p>
<p>security of neighbouring states. </p>
<p>“The Attorney also emphasises that it is vitally important to keep constantly in view </p>
<p>the precarious nature of the legal basis for UK and US action in the No-Fly Zones.  </p>
<p>It was not yet generally accepted that there is a right in international law to prevent </p>
<p>or avert a humanitarian catastrophe … there is a considerable body of legal  </p>
<p>opinion which holds that such a right was not at present clearly established in </p>
<p>international law.” </p>
<p><b>166. </b> Mr Brummell stated that Lord Williams “would be grateful for a further update of the </p>
<p>situation in the north and south of Iraq, consideration of alternatives to the maintenance </p>
<p>of the Zones, and information on any civilian casualties associated with UK and US </p>
<p>operations in relation to the Zones”, by the end of May 2001. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> Mr Sawers showed Mr Brummell’s letter to Mr Blair, and in a handwritten note </p>
<p>which accompanied it he wrote:</p>
<p>“The Attorney has finally backed down, at least for now … But it is going to be </p>
<p>difficult to sustain at least the southern NFZ for much longer – it scarcely meets  </p>
<p>the criteria.”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>168. </b> UK and US attacks on targets north of the southern NFZ took place on </p>
<p>16 February. The effect of the attacks is considered later in this Section. </p>

<p><b>170. </b> Following Mr Cook’s visit to the US in early February 2001, Mr Sawers wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Emyr Jones Parry, FCO Political Director, emphasising the need to have:</p>
<p>“… an agreed HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] approach, approved by the Prime </p>
<p>Minister before we go too far down the road of UK/US consultations … we need to </p>
<p>have a clear sense of what we want if we are to shape US thinking.”</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>171. </b> There appeared to be three important issues “on which to clear our minds”:</p>

<p>Containing the threat against Iraq’s neighbours, seen from here, should be at </p>
<p>least as important as the WMD factor. That was the original casus belli …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What do we mean by ‘narrower and deeper’ sanctions?” Mr Jones Parry’s </p>
<p>talks appeared to conceive of a two-phase approach, first focusing on enforcing </p>
<p>essential sanctions only and then (after the implementation of resolution 1284), </p>
<p>the suspension of sanctions. But what sanctions would there be left to suspend </p>
<p>if sanctions were narrowed before resolution 1284 was implemented?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How UNMOVIC inspections fitted into the policy. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Mr Sawers stated that the Cabinet Office was in the Iead in ensuring that the </p>
<p>issues he had raised, and other issues, were “worked through inter-departmentally”, and </p>
<p>suggested that a paper should be put to Ministers before the end of the month. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> On 12 February, Mr McKane circulated a draft ‘Note by Officials’ highlighting the </p>
<p>key issues on Iraq that “needed to be settled in the course of the review of Iraq policy”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The draft note stated that UK policy objectives and containment strategy remained </p>
<p>valid. The UK’s main aims were to get the US to accept that:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Even if we were to conclude that it is preferable not to deploy UNMOVIC, we need </p>
<p>to be seen to be working through the UN rather than unilaterally, and with the </p>
<p>support of the P5 and the rest of the UNSC [UN Security Council] if possible …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need to neutralise the sanctions issue and win back the moral high ground </p>
<p>… To achieve this, we need a much more targeted sanctions regime, which does </p>
<p>not affect ordinary people. We should move in this direction now, and not wait for </p>
<p>Saddam to sign up to UNSCR 1284.” </p>
<p><b>175. </b> Mr Sawers responded to Mr McKane, commenting that the approach set out in the </p>
<p>note was:</p>
<p>“… too status-quo oriented. Our shared concern is that the present policy is </p>
<p>crumbling, but the only proposal for adjusting it is to restrict the scope of sanctions. </p>
<p>The Americans are in the market for something much more radical … to sustain a </p>
<p>containment strategy, if necessary for the next eight years.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>176. </b> Mr Sawers’ view was that Ministers, including Mr Blair, would want to consider a </p>
<p>much more radical transformation of Iraqi policy. He suggested focusing on “our three </p>
<p>key objectives”:</p>
<p>“i)   The defence of Kuwait and Iraq’s neighbours from Iraqi aggression … </p>
<p>ii)  </p>
<p>Blocking WMD build-up … either an inspection regime along SCR 1284 lines …  </p>
<p>or a monitoring regime based outside Iraq …</p>
<p>iii)   Humanitarian relief …”</p>

<p>224</p>
<p><b>177. </b> Such an approach would allow the US and UK “to agree to end purely economic </p>
<p>sanctions and to stop patrolling the southern NFZ without the requirement for a  </p>
<p>quid pro quo from Saddam Hussein”. It would give the US and UK (rather than Iraq) </p>
<p>sustained control over the policy and address the threat of Iraqi aggression and the </p>
<p>plight of the Iraqi people. It was likely to entail some additional costs, possible  </p>
<p>including the deployment of additional troops to the region. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> Mr Jon Day, Chief of the Asessments Staff, responded to Mr McKane questioning </p>
<p>whether the draft note overstated the Iraqi threat to Kuwait: “The JIC has judged  </p>
<p>that Iraq would not move against Kuwait while the West maintains substantial forces  </p>
<p>in the region.”</p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 14 February 2001:  </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq: Economic Sanctions Eroding’</b></p>
<p>On 14 February, at the request of the FCO, the JIC provided an updated assessment on </p>
<p>the erosion of economic sanctions against Iraq.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein faced “<b>no economic pressure to accept UNSCR 1284</b>” </p>
<p>because he was “<b>successfully undermining the economic sanctions </b></p>
<p><b>regime</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Through “abuse of the Oil-for-Food programme and smuggling of oil and other </p>
<p>goods”, Saddam Hussein would “<b>be able to appropriate in the region of </b></p>
<p><b>US$1.5bn to US$1.8bn in cash and goods in 2001, slightly up on 2000</b>”. </p>
<p>There was scope for earning even more “if new surcharges, and commissions </p>
<p>[on contracts] became the accepted norm”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Iranian</b> interdiction efforts” had “<b>significantly reduced smuggling</b>” in the Gulf </p>
<p>but Saddam had “compensated by <b>exploiting land routes</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “apparent <b>success of the … border trade agreement</b>” had “encouraged </p>
<p>other <b>front-line states</b> to respond to Baghdad’s initiatives to improve economic </p>
<p>ties”. Those states were “<b>in the fore-front of efforts to test the enforceability </b></p>
<p><b>of the sanction regime</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Most countries believe that economic sanctions on Iraq are ineffective, </b></p>
<p><b>counterproductive and should now be lifted. </b>Without active enforcement, the </p>
<p><b>economic sanctions regime will continue to erode </b>as the front-line states </p>
<p>increase their trade links with Iraq and as Saddam’s officials devise more ways </p>
<p>to capture the revenue from OFF [programme] oil sales.”</p>
<p>The JIC assessed that, encouraged by the success of the Iraq/Turkey border agreement, </p>
<p>there had been a “significant increase in the erosion of sanctions over the last six months”.</p>
<p>The JIC estimated that, in 2001, oil smuggling could generate up to US$650m and abuse </p>
<p>of the OFF programme through bribes, surcharges and “commissions” up to US$600m. </p>

<p>225</p>
<p>The Jordan/Iraq trade protocol was worth around US$400m. Smuggling of non-oil goods </p>
<p>could produce up to US$150m. </p>
<p>The JIC stated that, since December 2000, OFF programme exports had halved as </p>
<p>Baghdad tried to force oil buyers to pay surcharges of up to US$0.5 a barrel into </p>
<p>unsupervised accounts. Most oil companies had refused to pay. The surcharge had then </p>
<p>been halved and oil sales had increased. </p>
<p>The JIC stated that the Iraqi leadership believed that the new US Administration would be </p>
<p>“unable to prevent further deterioration” of the UN embargo.</p>
<p>The JIC stated that there was “broad international consensus to <b>maintain the arms </b></p>
<p><b>embargo</b> at least as long as he [Saddam Hussein] remains in power”. While there </p>
<p>had been “some leakage” of air-defence equipment, spares for military equipment and </p>
<p>armoured vehicles and dual-use goods, there was “no evidence that major equipment, </p>
<p>such as complete weapon systems” had been imported. Saddam Hussein wanted </p>
<p>“sanctions lifted because the UN arms embargo has severely limited Iraq’s capacity to </p>
<p>re-build and re-equip its military”. </p>
<p><b>179. </b> Mr McKane sent a final version of the note to Mr Sawers on 15 February.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>180. </b> The note stated that, since the 1991 Gulf Conflict, the UK’s policy objectives </p>
<p>towards Iraq had been “in the short term to reduce the threat Saddam poses to the </p>
<p>region, including by eliminating his WMD programmes; and, in the longer term, to </p>
<p>reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law abiding member of the international </p>
<p>community”. Those objectives remained valid, although the UK “should recognise  </p>
<p>that we are unlikely to rid Iraq completely of WMD and avoid presenting this as  </p>
<p>our main aim”. </p>
<p><b>181. </b> The note summarised the key elements of the policy of containment as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>WMD disarmament</b>, through inspections and monitoring. Since Operation </p>
<p>Desert Fox and the withdrawal of UNSCOM, this has been on ice …</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Sanctions</b>, which have become increasingly controversial. There is still </p>
<p>widespread support for the arms embargo, and for controls on dual use </p>
<p>materials with plausible application to WMD programmes … But there is </p>
<p>an increasing sense that economic sanctions are unfair to the Iraqi people, </p>
<p>ineffective as a means of pressuring the regime, and indeed counter-productive </p>
<p>because Saddam and his cronies benefit disproportionately from the smuggling </p>
<p>which undermines the sanctions …</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Controls on Iraq’s oil revenues</b>, through the UN escrow account and the </p>
<p>Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme. These are important in preventing Saddam from </p>
<p>diverting revenue to conventional or WMD re-armament …</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Military containment</b>, including through the No-Fly Zones (NFZs).”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>182. </b> On WMD, the note stated that:</p>
<p>“<b>Neither UNMOVIC nor any other arrangement (including bombing) will provide </b></p>
<p><b>a guaranteed way of ridding Iraq completely of WMD.</b> A robust UNMOVIC </p>
<p>presence in-country would undoubtedly constrain Iraqi WMD activity but not  </p>
<p>prevent it …</p>
<p>“… <b>Departments do not agree whether UNMOVIC entry [in]to Iraq would be, on </b></p>
<p><b>balance, desirable or undesirable</b>.” </p>
<p><b>183. </b> On the outcome of the review of the military need for the NFZs, the note stated that </p>
<p>they had become a “target for criticism” and a “double-edged weapon”, and that: </p>
<p>“The humanitarian role for the NFZs remains valid but this is increasingly disputed. </p>
<p>The southern NFZ also plays a key role in current contingency plans for the defence </p>
<p>of Kuwait, providing tactical intelligence of Iraqi moves and a chance to counter them </p>
<p>from the air, buying time to reinforce Kuwait itself … Some are tempted to cease </p>
<p>patrolling the NFZs and focus more on other means of deterring Iraq and defending </p>
<p>its neighbours. Departments disagree on the implications of this. But the UK and </p>
<p>US military assessment is that – <b>if Ministers still wanted to defend Kuwait rather </b></p>
<p><b>than planning on ejecting an Iraqi force which had succeeded in occupying it – </b></p>
<p><b>without the southern NFZ, the US and UK collectively would need to station up </b></p>
<p><b>to three additional armoured brigades in Kuwait</b>, and augment the current land- </p>
<p>and sea-based strike capability (i.e. aircraft and cruise missiles).”</p>
<p><b>184. </b> On the possibility of regime change, the note stated that:</p>
<p>“Most US officials, to widely varying degrees, believe that their Iraq policy should </p>
<p>include the promotion of change in the country’s Government …</p>
<p>“… aggressive rhetoric on this subject tends to be counter-productive in the region, </p>
<p>particularly when it cannot be backed up by practical success. </p>
<p>“<b>But there is a case for including the promotion of change as part of our  </b></p>
<p><b>policy rather than simply assuming an indefinite stalemate. Some movement </b></p>
<p><b>in this direction is likely to be essential to keep the US on board.</b> We could </p>
<p>certainly do more to hold out to the Iraqi people the prospect of a brighter future </p>
<p>post-Saddam – a sort of contract with Iraq. This could include a better co-ordinated </p>
<p>US/UK information campaign, and more work with the Iraqi opposition in exile </p>
<p>(though there is some scepticism over their credibility and usefulness). We could </p>
<p>also consider more support for INDICT’s campaign</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> to bring Saddam and some of </p>
<p>his cronies to justice for war crimes.”</p>
<p>101 </p>
<p>INDICT was established in 1996 to campaign for the creation of an ad hoc International Criminal </p>
<p>Tribunal – similar to those established for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda – to try leading members of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide and </p>
<p>torture.</p>

<p>227</p>
<p><b>185. </b> The note concluded:</p>
<p>“Whatever we do, we need to move to ‘smarter’ (but better enforced) sanctions and </p>
<p>recapture the moral high ground. We cannot achieve complete WMD disarmament, </p>
<p>but we should aim to contain Iraqi activity: UNMOVIC may be the best way of doing </p>
<p>this, but there are downsides to having UNMOVIC in Iraq and, anyway, Saddam is </p>
<p>unlikely to agree to their presence on Iraqi territory.”</p>
<p><b>186. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that, in relation to regime change:</p>
<p>“A lot of these ideas were modelled on the successful policy that we had been </p>
<p>pursuing in relation to Serbia and President Milosevic. All these elements, a contract </p>
<p>with the Serbian people, information flows, indictments of the leader and support for </p>
<p>the opposition had brought down President Milosevic a few months earlier, it was </p>
<p>successful regime change policy.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Cook’s Private Office wrote to No.10 on 20 February, advising that Mr Cook </p>
<p>agreed with much of the Cabinet Office note of 15 February but that he was “concerned </p>
<p>that it reflected military priorities at the expense of broader diplomatic and political </p>
<p>issues”.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> In his view, the Iraqi risk to Kuwait if patrolling ceased in the southern NFZ </p>
<p>was overstated: “Saddam should be in no doubt that should he move against Kuwait, </p>
<p>the US/UK response would be massive.” Mr Cook also questioned the suggestion in </p>
<p>the note that the alternative to the southern NFZ would be a need to station up to three </p>
<p>additional armoured brigades in Kuwait. He believed the UK should strongly discourage </p>
<p>the US from more active patrolling and advised that the UK should keep its distance </p>
<p>from the US policy of supporting Iraqi opposition groups in exile. </p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Cook concluded: “Ultimately, however robust our military planning, our policy </p>
<p>can succeed only if there is a degree of international consensus.” </p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Cook also asked to speak to Mr Blair to discuss the line he would take at </p>
<p>Camp David. </p>
<p><b>190. </b> The Inquiry has not seen a record of a conversation between Mr Blair and Mr Cook </p>
<p>on Iraq at this time.</p>
<p><b>No.10’s advice</b></p>
<p><b>191. </b> Mr Sawers advised Mr Blair on 16 February that there was “one piece of hard </p>
<p>policy to discuss with President Bush and Colin Powell”: Iraq.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> The US had started a </p>
<p>policy review and wanted to “get a new policy in place in the next month”. No decisions </p>
<p>were yet needed, but Mr Sawers suggested Mr Blair would want to familiarise himself </p>
<p>with the subject as President Bush would ask for his views. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Mr Sawers set out the main issues and posed a number of questions, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Do we really want UN inspectors to go back into Iraq while Saddam remains in </p>
<p>power?” They might constrain Iraq’s WMD programme but their presence would </p>
<p>allow Saddam Hussein to provoke regular crises. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Could we stop enforcing the southern NFZ?” Military views differed, and it was </p>
<p>not just a military judgement.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“How can we play up the prospects for Iraq once they get rid of Saddam?” </p>
<p>Mr Sawers advised that: “A Contract with Iraq (like the one we offered to Serbia) </p>
<p>is possible. But I think we have to resist those Americans who want to fund a </p>
<p>1980s Afghanistan-style insurgency, as that will only trigger a humanitarian </p>
<p>catastrophe through Iraqi repression.” </p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Sawers advised that, in his view, the Security Council should maintain a strong </p>
<p>grip on Iraqi oil revenues while moving to substantially lighter sanctions, ease up on </p>
<p>the pressure to get inspections back into Iraq, while making it “more explicit” that there </p>
<p>would be a military response if Iraq attacked a neighbour or reconstituted its WMD. </p>
<p><b>Attacks by coalition aircraft north of the southern NFZ, 16 February 2001</b></p>
<p><b>194. </b> On 16 February, US and UK aircraft attacked elements of the Iraqi air-defence </p>
<p>system. Six targets were engaged; five were north of the boundary of the southern NFZ. </p>
<p><b>195. </b> The attacks were controversial. Mr Tony Benn, in his capacity as President of </p>
<p>Labour Action for Peace, wrote to Mr Blair seeking the recall of Parliament.</p>

<p><b>Government statements on the 16 February attacks </b></p>
<p>On 16 February 2001, US and UK aircraft attacked elements of the Iraqi air-defence </p>
<p>system. Six targets were engaged; five were north of the boundary of the southern NFZ. </p>
<p>Mr Blair issued a statement on the attacks the following day.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> He stated that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was pursuing a policy of “total control” over the people of Iraq, and was “ready </p>
<p>to engage in systematic repression”, in particular of the Kurds in the north of Iraq and </p>
<p>the Shia in the south. The NFZs were part of a wider effort to contain the threat posed by </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein. Without them, he would be able to move his troops freely and “repress </p>
<p>his own people mercilessly, including by using helicopter gunships as he did in 1991 and </p>
<p>1992”. The attack by coalition aircraft had been “a limited operation” with the sole purpose </p>
<p>of defending the aircrew patrolling the NFZs.</p>

<p>1.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September 2000 to September 2001</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>An MOD press statement on the same day stated that the attacks were conducted in </p>
<p>self-defence in response to repeated Iraqi threats to coalition aircraft.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> Iraqi air defences </p>
<p>had been increasing the frequency of their attacks using sophisticated command and </p>
<p>control arrangements, posing an increasing threat to coalition aircraft. </p>
<p>Mr Hoon told the House of Commons on 26 February:</p>
<p>“Since January 1999, Saddam’s air defence units have made sustained and </p>
<p>concerted efforts to shoot down United Kingdom and United States aircraft. During </p>
<p>that period there have been more than 1,200 attempts to target them, using surface-</p>
<p>to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. Coalition aircraft are legally authorised to </p>
<p>respond to those attacks in self-defence. They do so entirely in accordance with </p>
<p>international law, attacking only those military facilities that contribute, as part of the </p>
<p>Iraqi integrated air defence system, to the threat to coalition aircraft … Over recent </p>
<p>weeks, the Iraqis have significantly increased their efforts, amounting to a qualitative </p>
<p>and quantitative increase in the threat. In January, there were more surface-to-air </p>
<p>missile attacks than in the whole of 2000. The Iraqis have used new tactics, including </p>
<p>the use of radars and command centres located outside the southern zone to cue </p>
<p>offensive systems within it. That threat to our Service Personnel is real and present. </p>
<p>The operation on the evening of 16 February was therefore planned and carried </p>
<p>out against that background. It was a proportionate response in self-defence, taken </p>
<p>solely to reduce the risk to our aircrew carrying out routine humanitarian patrols of the </p>
<p>southern No-Fly Zone.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Sawers advised Mr Blair that as a result of the attacks there was now more </p>
<p>attention on Iraq, and that having to defend the NFZs so publicly made it more difficult  </p>
<p>to move back from them.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Sawers proposed developing benchmarks against which to gauge the present </p>
<p>policy. Those were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Effectiveness, in containing the threat from Iraq against its neighbours;  </p>
<p>in preventing Saddam building up his WMD; and in preventing a new </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sustainability, so that we have a policy which we can keep going for as long as </p>
<p>Saddam remains in power, if necessary the next six to eight years. That entails </p>
<p>having and retaining the support of both the countries of the region and our own </p>
<p>public. A new P5 consensus would also help; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Control, so that Saddam cannot dictate each step. We have had better control  </p>
<p>in the last two years than we had before, and we should be careful not to give  </p>
<p>it up.” </p>
<p><b>199. </b> An internal FCO minute on the 16 February attack, which was produced later </p>
<p>that month, stated that the Pentagon’s decision to play up the operation was a serious </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>misjudgement that had fuelled international criticism, particularly from key allies such as </p>
<p>Turkey and Saudi Arabia:</p>
<p>“By trailing a full-scale live briefing once the operation was under way, they [the </p>
<p>Pentagon] fuelled media hype and speculation that this was a major change in our </p>
<p>military posture and, possibly, a repeat of Operation Desert Fox … The Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary [Mr Cook] is also concerned that while we have emphasised that the </p>
<p>operation had been solely to protect our pilots, President Bush took the line that </p>
<p>the primary aim of the attack was to send a message to the Iraqi regime. This is </p>
<p>unhelpful from both a presentational and legal point of view.”</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>200. </b> In her memoir, Dr Rice wrote that, although she had been briefed on the operation </p>
<p>in advance, she had not appreciated the scale and nature of the attack.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> The operation </p>
<p>had coincided with – and disrupted – President Bush’s first meeting with President </p>
<p>Vicente Fox of Mexico. Dr Rice wrote that the reaction to the attack in the US media had </p>
<p>been positive, including comments that the attacks had “sent a timely signal” to Iraq that </p>
<p>the new US Administration would “not shy away from using force to contain any new </p>
<p>Iraqi military threat”. </p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I don’t think we [the UK Government] did a very good job of explaining what was </p>
<p>going on, in public. We certainly probably didn’t help … the new US Administration to </p>
<p>do a very good job of explaining it … </p>
<p>“… what it looked like from the point of view of people … particularly in the region, </p>
<p>was that suddenly, we [the US and UK] pushed the campaign north, we were up </p>
<p>around Baghdad and it appeared something had happened and was that presaging </p>
<p>something they … had been reading about, regime change.”</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>202. </b> Sir William Patey accepted that there was a risk of misinterpretation: </p>
<p>“I think when the MOD first proposed this operation, there was really the odd </p>
<p>frisson in the Foreign Office, not because of its legality … We were worried [that] </p>
<p>… the scale of the operation could be misinterpreted. Here we had a new American </p>
<p>Administration coming in that at least had a history of a more aggressive stance </p>
<p>towards [Iraq] … </p>
<p>“So I think in the Foreign Office we were worried that this might be misinterpreted as </p>
<p>a sort of military assault on Iraq, and that was not the intention.”</p>

<p>231</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that No.10 had, perhaps, not been as involved as </p>
<p>it might have been in discussion of the 16 February attack: </p>
<p>“This was briefed to the Prime Minister but both we and the White House were a bit </p>
<p>surprised … because we weren’t fully involved in the discussions of the timing and it </p>
<p>happened at short notice on a Friday night … a week or so before the Prime Minister </p>
<p>went off to Camp David. </p>
<p>“The timing was coincidental … It did in many ways serve to underline the difficulty </p>
<p>of maintaining the policy on No-Fly Zones.”</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Sir John Sawers agreed with the Inquiry that there had been uproar in the Middle </p>
<p>East about the intensity and location of the attacks. He continued: </p>
<p>“And I think that was very much on Vice President Cheney and President Bush’s </p>
<p>minds, that there had been a sharp reaction. And in a sense it gave force to the </p>
<p>argument that we needed to move to a better targeted policy.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Lord Williams of Baglan, a Special Adviser to Mr Cook from 2000 to 2001 (and </p>
<p>subsequently to Mr Straw until July 2005), told the Inquiry that Mr Cook had been </p>
<p>“concerned that the attack had not merited Ministerial authorisation”; and that he feared </p>
<p>“it was the harbinger of a more assertive US stance on Iraq”.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Camp David</b></p>
<p><b>206. </b> At his first White House press conference in February 2001, President Bush said </p>
<p>that he would “review options as to how to make the sanctions work”.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>207. </b> On 23 February, before travelling to Camp David, Mr Blair met Vice President </p>
<p>Cheney in Washington.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> Mr Blair argued that the sanctions regime was not perfect, but </p>
<p>that it had restrained Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p><b>208. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that Iraq was not a top priority for his meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush at Camp David.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>209. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry that the two foreign policy issues at the top </p>
<p>of the agenda were the anti-ballistic missile treaty and nuclear missile defence.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>210. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that Iraq had been the first subject discussed at </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>that Colin Powell who was in charge of reviewing policy could be there and take </p>
<p>part in discussions. President Bush … was concerned about our policy, that we had </p>
<p>sanctions that the regime was evading but which were impacting on Iraqi children. </p>
<p>He was concerned about the vulnerability of US pilots monitoring the No-Fly </p>
<p>Zones and he wanted to get to a more realistic policy, as he described it. And Colin </p>
<p>Powell set out some elements which were very close to our own thinking, that the </p>
<p>widespread sanctions should be replaced by controls on weapons, [and] that we </p>
<p>should tighten the border monitoring around Iraq with a view to ensuring that those </p>
<p>controls we retained were effective. But once we were confident that they were </p>
<p>effective … the wider sanctions could be suspended and in due course lifted.</p>
<p>“There was a debate about the No-Fly Zones that he wanted to pursue, and some </p>
<p>of the Condoleezza Rice ideas on regime change, i.e. political elements, not military </p>
<p>elements, also featured in the discussion, but the fundamental one was to narrow </p>
<p>down sanctions to those that were most important.</p>
<p>“… Prime Minister Blair welcomed these thoughts and this approach, agreed that we </p>
<p>should retain control on Iraq’s oil revenues, but that our broad approach should be to </p>
<p>narrow the scope of sanctions to those elements which were really most important </p>
<p>to us and at the same time ensure that information about what life would be like – if </p>
<p>Saddam were to be removed by the Iraqi people – what would that look like, [was </p>
<p>available] … </p>
<p>“So actually that was quite close alignment of thinking between President Bush </p>
<p>and Prime Minister Blair. They agreed that the Foreign Ministers should work more </p>
<p>closely together … and that they would stay in touch on the development of policy </p>
<p>thinking but there was broad common ground established on Iraq at the meeting. </p>
<p>There were very few issues of difference at Camp David and that certainly wasn’t </p>
<p>one of them.”</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Sir John went on to clarify his reference to “controls on weapons”:</p>
<p>“… what the Americans were thinking which was in line with our own thinking … was </p>
<p>that sanctions should be narrowed to an arms embargo and dual-use goods that </p>
<p>could be used in a weapons of mass destruction programme. [Secretary] Powell </p>
<p>made clear that he was most concerned about Iraq’s activities on chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons and that there was a range of dual use goods here that should </p>
<p>be properly controlled and should be subject to sanctions but the wider range of </p>
<p>trade sanctions should be removed.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>212. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir John whether the policy that developed later, to threaten the </p>
<p>use of force to secure entry for UNMOVIC inspection teams, was a “gleam in anybody’s </p>
<p>eye” at this time. Sir John told the Inquiry:</p>

<p>233</p>
<p>“Not really because there wasn’t any great confidence that UNMOVIC would be any </p>
<p>more successful than UNSCOM had been … and we didn’t think that we could force </p>
<p>Saddam through military action to accept an inspections regime.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>213. </b> The record of the Camp David meeting, produced by Mr Sawers, stated that the </p>
<p>US and UK agreed on the need for a policy on Iraq which was more widely supported in </p>
<p>the Middle East region.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>214. </b> As a result of the policy of the previous 10 years, Iraq was not as large a threat as </p>
<p>it could have been (including to Kuwait); but Saddam Hussein was still pursuing WMD </p>
<p>(he had done little on the nuclear side). </p>
<p><b>215. </b> In Mr Blair’s view, the approach should be to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>refocus sanctions on those items which Saddam Hussein really needed; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>control his money supply but allow him to use it for non-military economic </p>
<p>advancement; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>retain the capacity for military action.</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr Blair stated that we should not say that we were relaxing our policy because </p>
<p>sanctions had not worked. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> Mr Blair concluded that we must improve our public presentation. He suggested </p>
<p>that the approach should be presented as a “deal” comprising four elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>do the right thing by the Iraqi people, with whom we have no quarrel;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tighten weapons controls on Saddam Hussein;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>retain financial control on Saddam Hussein; and </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>Dr Rice. Dr Rice had agreed with Mr Sawers’ assessment that “we were still a long </p>
<p>way from having a new policy on Iraq”. Mr Sawers commended the work of INDICT </p>
<p>and stated that the UK favoured charging Saddam Hussein and a few others with war </p>
<p>crimes; but the indictments should not go too wide as others needed an incentive to </p>
<p>move against Saddam Hussein. Mr Sawers also set out Mr Cook’s idea of a ‘Contract </p>
<p>with the Iraqi People’, in which there was some interest. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> On the follow-up to the talks, Mr Sawers suggested:</p>

<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>223. </b> Mr McKane reported the conclusions of the meeting:</p>
<p>“The message for Ministers which comes out of all of this is that, provided US and </p>
<p>UK forces remain in theatre, it is unlikely that Saddam would seek to exploit the </p>
<p>abolition of the southern No-Fly Zone by attacking Kuwait. However, there remains </p>
<p>a slight possibility that Saddam would order an attack and the southern No-Fly Zone </p>
<p>plays an important part in our plans for defending Kuwait in such circumstances … </p>
<p>“In judging whether the risk of an attack by Saddam would be so small that we could </p>
<p>afford to abolish the southern No-Fly Zone, Ministers would have to keep in mind </p>
<p>that, in the absence of the No-Fly Zone, it might be impracticable to maintain our </p>
<p>existing air forces in the region.” </p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that the MOD was concerned about the greater cost of </p>
<p>alternative methods to protect Kuwait: </p>
<p>“… the No-Fly Zones … had a side benefit of risk reduction. Because we were flying </p>
<p>over southern Iraq most of the time, we knew what the military situation was on the </p>
<p>ground, and that gave us some time, if there had started to be a build-up of another </p>
<p>repeated attack on Kuwait … it would have given us the opportunity to interdict any </p>
<p>ground force movements which were the start of an attack on Kuwait and some time </p>
<p>to reinforce, but those two things together actually allowed us to be in the rather </p>
<p>comfortable position of having a not very expensive military operation … It allowed </p>
<p>us to manage without big ground force deployments …”</p>

<p>235</p>
<p><b>Defining the new UK policy framework</b></p>
<p><b>225. </b> According to published US accounts, on 1 March Secretary Powell was “given the </p>
<p>task of devising a plan and strategy to refocus the UN economic sanctions on weapons </p>
<p>control” at a meeting of National Security Council “Principals”.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> President Bush also </p>
<p>asked for “a better military plan in the event that a pilot was shot down” over Iraq. </p>
<p><b>The National Security Council and Principals Committee</b></p>
<p>The US National Security Council (NSC) was established in accordance with the </p>
<p>provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 to “advise the President with respect to the </p>
<p>integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security so as </p>
<p>to enable the military services and the other departments and agencies of the Government </p>
<p>to cooperate more effectively in matters involving the national security.”</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In March 2001, President Bush directed that attendees should include the President, the </p>
<p>Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of </p>
<p>Defense, and the National Security Advisor.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> The Director of Central Intelligence and the </p>
<p>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were required to attend as statutory advisers.</p>
<p>Others who were directed to attend, as required, included: the Chief of Staff to the </p>
<p>President; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; Counsel to the President; </p>
<p>the Attorney General; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and the </p>
<p>heads and senior officials of other executive departments and agencies.</p>
<p>The NSC Principals Committee was established in 1989 as a forum for consideration </p>
<p>of policy issues affecting national security. President Bush directed that its membership </p>
<p>should have as regular attendees the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, </p>
<p>the Secretary of Defense, the Chief of Staff to the President, and the National  </p>
<p>Security Advisor. </p>
<p>The Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, the National </p>
<p>Security Advisor and the Deputy National Security Advisor were required to attend all </p>
<p>meetings of the NSC/PC. </p>
<p>Others who were directed to attend, as required, included: the Director of Central </p>
<p>Intelligence; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Attorney General; the Director </p>
<p>of the Office of Management and Budget; Counsel to the President; the Secretary of </p>
<p>Commerce; the United States Trade Representative; the Assistant to the President for </p>
<p>Economic Policy; the Secretary of Agriculture; and the heads and senior officials of other </p>
<p>executive departments and agencies.</p>

<p><b>228.  The new framework would require a new UN resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>229. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“The US and the UK … began to revise their policy approach to concentrate on </p>
<p>four elements: narrowing and deepening sanctions so that they applied much </p>
<p>more directly to weapons systems; making it clear publicly that WMD were the </p>
<p>priority and that inspectors needed to return (but with sufficient powers to avoid </p>
<p>Iraqi manipulation of them); tightening controls on Iraqi oil revenues; and otherwise </p>
<p>ensuring the best possible containment of Iraq through the No-Fly Zones, control of </p>
<p>smuggling and eventually the full implementation of SCR 1284.”</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>230. </b> On 7 March, Mr Sawers sent out a revised version of “the proposed new policy </p>
<p>framework on Iraq”, incorporating comments from the FCO, the MOD and the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office.</p>

<p> Mr Sawers advised that the paper should be submitted to Mr Cook, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>and Mr Blair in advance of discussions between US and UK officials in Washington. </p>
<p><b>231. </b> Mr Sawers’ covering letter highlighted the fact that the paper included a number of </p>
<p>“implicit deals”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>sanctions on civilian trade would be ended in return for co-operation from Iraq’s </p>
<p>neighbours to bring all Iraqi oil revenues under UN control;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France and Russia would secure more efficient approval procedures, with </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government having more freedom to buy civilian goods, in return for </p>
<p>agreement on continued UN control of oil revenues;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>civilian flights would be regularised in return for UN inspection of cargoes at </p>
<p>the borders; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assets of “non-regime” Iraqis would be unfrozen and private sector trade </p>
<p>permitted in return for targeted sanctions on those around Saddam Hussein; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new consensus would be sought on the need for fundamental change inside </p>
<p>Iraq, while respecting Iraq’s territorial integrity; “pending such change, military </p>
<p>measures (including the No-Fly Zones) would have to be at least tolerated”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>resolution 1284 would remain part of the policy and “many of the benefits for Iraq </p>
<p>would be brought forward without the need for Iraqi compliance”. </p>
<p><b>232. </b> The paper set out a number of “headlines”:</p>
<p>“A revised set of controls would be introduced as soon as possible, focused on Iraq’s </p>

<p>237</p>
<p>Iraq’s neighbours would bring an end to illegal oil exports and give practical support </p>
<p>to enforce the revised controls. UN control of oil revenues would be retained. </p>
<p>SCR 1284 would remain on the table with modest incentives for Iraqi compliance. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, UNMOVIC would retain a role outside Iraq.</p>
<p>“The NFZs would continue with patrolling patterns that minimise risk and possibly </p>

<p><b>234. </b> The paper set out the “New arrangements to be introduced straight away”, </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi oil revenues to remain under UN control and illegal trade to be brought </p>

<p><b>235. </b> Those arrangements would require a new resolution. </p>
<p><b>236. </b> On “regime change”, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“The US and UK would re-make the case against Saddam Hussein. We would issue </p>
<p>a Contract with the Iraqi People, setting out our goal of a peaceful law-abiding Iraq, </p>
<p>fully reintegrated into the international community, with its people free to live in a </p>
<p>society based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and economic freedom, </p>
<p>and without threat of repression, torture and arbitrary arrest. The Contract would </p>
<p>make clear that the Iraqi regime’s record and behaviour made it impossible for Iraq </p>
<p>to meet the criteria for rejoining the international community without fundamental </p>
<p>change …”</p>
<p><b>237. </b> On “military measures”, the paper stated: </p>
<p>“(i) We would be prepared to reduce the territory covered by the NFZs, e.g. by </p>
<p>restricting the Northern NFZ to the Kurdish controlled areas and removing low </p>
<p>priority areas from the Southern NFZ;</p>
<p>(ii) Red lines would be set out and if Iraq were in material breach of them, </p>
<p>e.g. by reconstituting its military capacity to threaten its neighbours, or developing its </p>
<p>WMD/missile capabilities, it would be clear that we would take direct action, at a time </p>
<p>of our choosing, once the necessary regional support and legal base were in place.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 8 March 2001: ‘Impact of Smarter Sanctions’</b></p>
<p><b>238. </b> On 8 March, the JIC reviewed existing sanctions on Iraq and assessed the likely </p>
<p>impact of “smarter sanctions”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>239. </b> The review of existing sanctions covered much the same ground as the February </p>
<p>assessment. </p>
<p><b>240. </b> On smarter sanctions, the JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was envisaged that smarter sanctions would: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>focus on military and dual-use items, and allow all civil trade; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>retain UN control over oil revenue and bring oil smuggling under those </p>
<p>controls; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>enhance border controls against prohibited trade.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“By allowing all civil trade, smarter sanctions would give the US and UK the </p>
<p>opportunity to <b>shift the political debate</b> away from the humanitarian issue.” Iraq </p>
<p>argued for “control of revenues as an issue of sovereignty”. Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>would “still seek to blame sanctions [for humanitarian problems] and popular </p>
<p>Arab opinion will remain susceptible to his propaganda. But he will find it <b>harder </b></p>
<p><b>to persuade Arab governments and the wider international community that </b></p>
<p><b>smarter sanctions are to blame for the suffering of the Iraqi people</b>.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The <b>greatest potential gains</b> in terms of cutting Saddam’s illicit revenue would </p>
<p>come from <b>curbing oil smuggling</b>.” Neighbouring states would be likely to </p>
<p>demand compensation for bringing trade under UN control. The income lost </p>
<p>could be in excess of US$1bn per year. Unless all routes were closed off, a </p>
<p>reduction in oil smuggling via one route was likely to be made up, at least in part, </p>
<p>via another. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Governments in the region were “<b>likely to agree in principle to inspection of </b></p>
<p><b>border crossings</b> and trade in return for free civil trade”. But this would be “hard </p>
<p>to sell” and border controls would be difficult to implement effectively. </p>
<p><b>241. </b> The JIC stated that, if a smarter sanctions policy was adopted, Iraq would still </p>
<p>try to smuggle oil, evade the controls on military and dual-use imports, and abuse the </p>
<p>OFF programme. The “<b>key battle would be over political perceptions</b> and hence the </p>
<p>willingness of regional governments to co-operate with other aspects of a revised policy”.</p>
<p><b>242. </b> The JIC stated that whatever agreements on inspections of border crossings and </p>
<p>trade were reached in principle, it was:</p>
<p>“… <b>unlikely that border controls would be effective in practice.  </b></p>
<p><b>A comprehensive international border monitoring presence</b> would be  </p>
<p>required … such monitoring <b>would be heavy on manpower and resources</b>,  </p>

<p>239</p>
<p>and frontline states would be reluctant to agree an intrusive regime. Moreover as </p>
<p>general trade increased, there would be a growing risk that military components  </p>
<p>and WMD dual-use items would be smuggled to Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>243. </b> The arms embargo remained “largely intact”. Some dual use goods had “slipped </p>
<p>through the net”. The introduction of a more widely accepted sanctions regime would </p>
<p>enhance the prospects of the arms embargo holding.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> If Saddam Hussein judged that he could no longer deflect blame for Iraq’s </p>
<p>humanitarian plight or maintain his sources of income, he might be forced to reassess </p>
<p>his policy of non-co-operation with resolution 1284. The JIC judged that “the effect of </p>
<p>smart sanctions is likely to fall short of this”. There were indications that Russia, France </p>
<p>and China would feel obliged to welcome the concept of smarter sanctions, but would </p>
<p>take account of Iraqi pressure and other political factors. Rebuilding P5 consensus </p>
<p>would be difficult; but a resolution passed with P5 unanimity would significantly increase </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq, and help rebuild UK public support for the UK’s policy.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Saddam Hussein was “more likely for now to use <b>renewed discussions at the UN</b> </p>
<p>as a means <b>to delay both progress on UNSCR 1284 and the introduction of smarter </b></p>
<p><b>sanctions</b>. If Saddam were forced to consider re-admitting UN weapons inspectors, he </p>
<p>would still seek to weaken the inspections provisions, an agreed timetable for the lifting </p>
<p>of sanctions and abolition of the NFZs.” </p>
<p><b>246. </b> Mr Ricketts wrote to Mr Sawers on 9 March, identifying the “main implications for </p>
<p>policy” of the analysis:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… the <b>arms embargo</b> remains crucial. It has stopped Saddam getting new </p>
<p>major weapons systems. We judge that state suppliers will continue to deny Iraq </p>
<p>such systems whilst Saddam remains in power … There is some leaking of </p>
<p>dual use items and spare parts. This would probably grow if all civil trade </p>
<p>was freed up …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… <b>ending sanctions on civil trade</b> would give us and the US an opportunity to </p>
<p>change perceptions in the Arab world and beyond on humanitarian issues …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… <b>bringing the revenues from oil smuggling back under UN control</b> would </p>
<p>have the biggest impact on the cash reaching Saddam’s pocket …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… <b>on inspection of border crossings</b>, we judged that neighbouring states </p>
<p>would be likely to agree in principle, although getting them to implement them </p>
<p>effectively will be much more difficult; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… the neighbours would want guarantees of compensation for income they lost </p>
<p>as a result of their co-operation on smuggling/border trade.”</p>

<p><b>247. </b> Mr Blair wrote on the minute from Mr Ricketts: “We must press on.”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>248. </b> In response to the policy framework circulated by Mr Sawers on 7 March, FCO </p>
<p>officials prepared a draft letter for Mr Cook to send to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> The draft letter stated: </p>
<p>“The key to progress is smarter sanctions, which focus on tougher controls on military </p>
<p>and dual-use goods, while improving the scope for normal civilian economic activity.” </p>
<p>Resolution 1284 would “remain on the table and we can offer some further modest </p>
<p>concessions along the lines discussed by officials … should Iraq comply (most unlikely)”. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Implementation of those measures would require a new resolution: “We should </p>
<p>pursue a technical resolution which rebalances the controls on Iraq but does not alter </p>
<p>the central provisions of existing SCRs.” </p>
<p><b>250. </b> The draft letter stated that the UK should continue to steer clear of “the various </p>
<p>American projects to overthrow Saddam”. </p>
<p><b>251. </b> The letter was not sent by Mr Cook.</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Senior US and UK officials met in Washington on 12 March to discuss Iraq.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Westmacott advised Mr Cook’s Private Secretary the following day that the talks had </p>
<p>been “pretty discouraging”. Mr Westmacott’s “tentative conclusions” from the talks were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>on sanctions, there appeared to be “some backtracking” within the State </p>
<p>Department from the “near identity” of views articulated by Secretary Powell </p>
<p>and Mr Cook at their recent meeting. On both oil smuggling and border controls, </p>
<p>the US appeared to favour “bilateral fixes” with the countries neighbouring Iraq </p>
<p>rather than action in the UN; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US appeared to be “a good deal more relaxed” than the UK about the need </p>
<p>to restore P5 unity; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>despite showing some interest in the idea of a ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’, </p>
<p>the State Department appeared to be more relaxed than the UK on the </p>
<p>presentational aspects of policy. </p>
<p><b>253. </b> Mr Sawers briefly discussed Iraq with a senior US official on 14 March.</p>
<p>138</p>

<p>Mr Sawers advised that US officials appeared to be retreating from the broad policy </p>
<p>goals set out by Secretary Powell. Mr Sawers stated that although negotiations on </p>
<p>smarter sanctions in the Security Council would be tricky, “it would be difficult to  </p>
<p>re-establish political consensus on Iraq without it”. </p>

<p> She welcomed the thrust of the new policy, but </p>

<p>She also asked that, if the sanctions regime changed, any revised strategy should take </p>
<p>into account that: the UK could not “shrug off… responsibility” to relieve the suffering that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had caused; the UN might continue to have “an important role”; and </p>
<p>that provisions should be made for humanitarian assistance for the Kurds.</p>

<p>“Although the operation of 16 February helped to reduce the qualitative threat level, </p>
<p>coalition aircraft have been threatened by AAA [anti-aircraft artillery] (and less often, </p>
<p>SAMs [surface-to-air missiles]) on almost every occasion that they have taken to </p>
<p>the air. It was against this background that US aircraft responded to Iraqi AAA this </p>
<p>morning. They released two weapons aimed at an air defence site in the southern </p>
<p>No-Fly Zone. Both missed their intended targets, landing in open ground without </p>
<p>causing collateral damage. </p>
<p>“The Defence Secretary is satisfied that action remains necessary to ensure that </p>
<p>the threat to our aircrew remains acceptable. Given that Saddam’s intent to attack </p>
<p>our aircraft appears unchanged, we can expect – provided that targets can be </p>
<p>identified and that the weather permits their engagement – to see further coalition </p>
<p>bombing activity. Any such action will, of course, be conducted within the existing </p>
<p>RO framework, with the authority for UK participation – within the carefully defined </p>
<p>parameters approved collectively by Ministers – delegated to military commanders. </p>

<p><b>259. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that, with regard to planned action to degrade Iraq’s </p>
<p>air-defence system:</p>
<p>“… a degree of caution … set in during the spring of 2001 … sensing that there </p>
<p>had been this reaction in the region, I think the senior commanders didn’t want </p>
<p>to propose more of that if they didn’t have to. As a result, some of the patrolling </p>
<p>reduced; in other words, a decision was taken that if we didn’t know where we  </p>
<p>might face this risk over part of the southern No-Fly Zone, we wouldn’t patrol there </p>
<p>for a while.</p>
<p>“So the operational commanders reduced the scope of the operation under their </p>
<p>discretionary authority and with our support, rather than proposing a repeat of those </p>
<p>situations. And that went on for a few months.”</p>

<p>arrangements by which it would be enforced. </p>
<p><b>264. </b> In his covering letter, Mr Sawers stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was common ground between the US and UK on the NFZs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had suggested that the question of regime change should be addressed </p>
<p>through a ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Efforts to chart a way forward on sanctions at a working level had got “bogged </p>
<p>down”. Sticking to the present arrangements while loosening some of the holds </p>
<p>that the US and UK had placed on OFF programme contracts, combined with a </p>
<p>renewed diplomatic effort, would be an advance but would “fall a good way short </p>
<p>of the goals the Prime Minister and President agreed”. Mr Sawers concluded: </p>
<p>“So our strong preference is to be more ambitious, and be prepared to agree </p>
<p>changes to the sanctions regime in the Security Council, and put real pressure </p>
<p>on Iraq’s neighbours to implement the agreed controls vigorously.”</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr McKane reported to Mr Sawers on 6 April that useful progress was being made </p>
<p>“to put flesh on the bones” of the policy framework attached to Mr Sawers’ letter of </p>
<p>7 March.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> The UK and the US appeared “to be in agreement on the broad direction, </p>
<p>but there is still some way to go not least in working out the details of a deal under which </p>
<p>Iraq’s neighbours would agree to bring all Iraqi oil revenues under UN control”. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> On sanctions, Mr McKane advised that the UK and US agreed on the case for </p>
<p>moving towards a single list of goods subject to UN controls (thereby freeing up the </p>
<p>import of other goods). Discussions still had to take place on the composition of that </p>
<p>list. Further talks with US State Department officials on 17 April would be followed by </p>
<p>talks with the French and “in due course” the Russians. The aim was to obtain UN </p>
<p>endorsement of a more targeted sanctions package in the OFF roll-over resolution  </p>
<p>due in June. </p>
<p><b>267. </b> On bringing illegal Iraqi oil exports under UN control, Mr McKane advised that it </p>
<p>was “not yet clear what concessions might have to be offered to the neighbouring states </p>
<p>to persuade them to co-operate”. Increased investment in border controls would “only </p>
<p>make sense if Iraq’s neighbours can be persuaded to co-operate – enforcement would </p>
<p>be carried out by their customs personnel”. The UK paper on border controls had been </p>
<p>passed to the US. </p>
<p><b>268. </b> Mr McKane advised that the UK paper on the controls that should remain in place </p>
<p>after the suspension of sanctions had been passed to the US. An essential feature was </p>
<p>maintaining the UN escrow account (see Section 1.1) “so that Iraq’s oil revenue (or other </p>
<p>significant sources of foreign exchange revenue) cannot be used to purchase either </p>
<p>conventional or unconventional arms or dual use items”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Mr McKane reported that there had been several discussions with the US on the </p>
<p>NFZs, and that: </p>
<p>“We are agreed that we need to retain the No-Fly Zones. Not only do they serve </p>
<p>a humanitarian purpose, but the southern No-Fly Zone is also necessary for the </p>
<p>defence of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia … We think it may be possible to reduce the </p>
<p>size of the No-Fly Zones … there has not been a positive US reaction. Defence </p>
<p>officials continue to discuss the scope for adjusting the pattern of patrolling but the </p>
<p>military advice, which the Defence Secretary has endorsed, is that there is only </p>
<p>modest scope to do so without placing our air crew at greater risk. We need to keep </p>
<p>the legal position under review (the Attorney General has asked for a further report </p>
<p>by the end of May) but any deterrent option which did not rely on the Southern </p>
<p>No-Fly Zone would entail a greater risk that Kuwait could be overrun before an </p>
<p>effective military response could be put in place.” </p>
<p><b>270. </b> Mr McKane reported that a draft ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’, which reflected </p>
<p>Ms Short’s concerns about a continuing key role for international agencies, had been </p>
<p>shared with the US. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> Mr Blair responded that getting a deal under which Iraq’s neighbours agreed to </p>
<p>bring all Iraqi oil revenues under UN control was the “essential quid pro quo” for better </p>
<p>targeted sanctions.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>272. </b> In response to a number of diplomatic telegrams which had described the NFZs </p>
<p>as necessary for the defence of Kuwait, Mr Iain Macleod, FCO Legal Counsellor, asked </p>
<p>colleagues on 6 April to remind diplomatic posts “of the need to ensure that the legal </p>
<p>justification for the zones (the prevention of a humanitarian catastrophe) is kept distinct </p>
<p>from other policy advantages which they may bring”.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>273. </b> Reviewing the Treasury/Bank of England paper on the options for amending </p>
<p>financial sanctions in early May, Mr McKane concluded that there were options for </p>
<p>easing sanctions without legislation, but that should be kept under review “until we </p>
<p>have thought through the full implications and seen the effect of other changes under </p>
<p>consideration”.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> The possibility of replacing the comprehensive regime with a targeted </p>
<p>asset freeze would require amendment to resolution 661(1990). That was not seen as a </p>
<p>“near-term option”.</p>

<p>245</p>
<p><b>275. </b> On 10 May, at the request of the MOD, the JIC assessed “what we know of Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD programmes, their future direction, our level of confidence in the intelligence, </p>
<p>our confidence in being able to identify the location of Iraq’s WMD facilities accurately </p>
<p>and the potential impact of direct military action against them”.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> The Assessment is </p>
<p>considered in detail in Section 4.1.</p>
<p><b>276. </b> The JIC stated that its “<b>knowledge of developments</b>” in Iraq’s WMD and ballistic </p>
<p>missile programmes since December 1998 was “<b>patchy</b>”, but judged that “<b>intelligence </b></p>
<p><b>gives grounds</b> <b>for concern</b> and suggests that Iraq is becoming bolder in conducting </p>
<p>activities prohibited by UNSCR 687”. </p>
<p><b>277. </b> The JIC knew most about Iraq’s ballistic missile programme, where there had been </p>
<p>a step change in progress over the previous two years.</p>
<p><b>278. </b> The JIC continued to “assess that while sanctions remain in place, Iraq cannot </p>
<p>indigenously develop and produce nuclear weapons. Were sanctions lifted, it would <b>take </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq at least five years to produce a nuclear device </b>and a<b> further two to produce  </b></p>
<p><b>a warhead</b>.” </p>
<p><b>279. </b> The JIC assessed the vulnerability of Iraq’s WMD programmes, and judged that:</p>
<p>“Although some WMD facilities could be destroyed by direct military action, this </p>
<p>would be <b>unlikely to have a significant impact on Iraq’s WMD programmes </b>…”</p>
<p><b>280. </b> The JIC stated:</p>
<p>“… <b>our ability to constrain Iraqi development of its WMD through other means </b></p>
<p>[other than military action] <b>is limited</b>. The development of Iraq’s WMD has been </p>
<p>helped in recent years by <b>the absence of UN inspectors, the increase in illegal </b></p>
<p><b>border trade and hard currency available to Iraq</b>. There have been an increasing </p>
<p>number of […] reports on orders for illegal imports of missile related components and </p>
<p>materials […] Because of the need for raw materials and components from abroad, </p>
<p>sanctions remain an obstacle to the development of all Iraq’s WMD programmes.”</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Under the heading “Implications”, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“This assessment underlines the importance of pursuing vigorously work on the </p>
<p>proposed UN controlled goods list, which would help sustain effective controls on </p>
<p>Iraqi WMD development.” </p>
<p><b>282.  Mr Cook reported that there had been good progress in agreeing a proposal </b></p>
<p><b>for a new sanctions regime with the US, but less on securing an agreement with </b></p>
<p><b>regional states to reduce oil smuggling. </b></p>
<p><b>283.  Mr Cook repeated his view that the UK should consider ending patrols of the </b></p>
<p><b>southern NFZ. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>284. </b> On 4 May, Mr Cook wrote to Mr Blair reporting that:</p>
<p>“We have made good progress on the review of sanctions, with UK/US now in </p>
<p>agreement on a new approach with the objective of turning the focus away from </p>
<p>sanctions and onto controls on WMD. Work is in hand to tie down the detail and </p>
<p>build up support in the region and in the P5, but we need to move quickly if we are  </p>
<p>to meet our deadline of 4 June, the date of the next ‘Oil-for-Food’ resolution.”</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Mr Cook reported on the debate within the US Administration. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> Mr Cook detailed the progress that had been made on sanctions:</p>
<p>“… we have now persuaded the US that, while the UN will continue to control Iraq’s </p>
<p>oil revenue, procedures should be adjusted so that only contracts containing items </p>
<p>on an agreed list of controlled goods require scrutiny by the Sanctions Committee. </p>
<p>This relaxation of UN controls will be balanced by new measures to reduce </p>
<p>sanctions-breaking and tighten up on dual-use goods. The new approach will reduce </p>
<p>the role of the UN, enable the US to vastly reduce the number of contracts on hold, </p>
<p>and allow us to deflect responsibility for the humanitarian situation away from us and </p>
<p>on to the Iraqi government. At the same time, by reducing the regime’s access to </p>
<p>hard cash, it will reduce Iraq’s room for manoeuvre.” </p>
<p><b>287. </b> Progress on confirming arrangements with “front-line states” to reduce oil </p>
<p>smuggling had been “slow”. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> There had been “less progress” on the US review of operations in the NFZs. </p>
<p>Mr Cook advised that:</p>
<p>“I believe we should look again at options for reducing patrols in the southern NFZ, </p>
<p>or even ending them. The legal difficulties remain, and I am also concerned that </p>
<p>operations in the southern NFZ will undo the advances we achieve through making </p>
<p>changes on sanctions and undermine hard won P5 and regional backing for our  </p>
<p>new approach.” </p>
<p><b>289. </b> On regime change, Mr Cook reported that: “No one in the [US] Administration </p>
<p>believes they can deliver Saddam’s overthrow”. The UK’s ‘Contract with the Iraqi </p>
<p>People’ fell short of calling for Saddam Hussein’s departure but set out the steps that </p>
<p>the international community would take to restore and rehabilitate Iraq in the event of his </p>
<p>departure. As regime change moved up the US agenda, the UK should encourage the </p>
<p>US to “sign up to this more credible and defensible approach”. There might soon be an </p>
<p>opportunity to garner wider international support for the idea of the contract, capitalising </p>
<p>on Iraq’s mishandling of the recent Arab Summit. </p>

<p>247</p>
<p><b>290. </b> Mr Hoon responded to Mr Cook’s letter on 14 May, stating that the: </p>
<p>“Proposed strategy [of 7 March] offers best prospect of retaining maximum control </p>
<p>over Iraqi revenues, impeding Baghdad’s ability to threaten its neighbours, and </p>
<p>regaining international support. But need to be realistic about chances of speedy </p>
<p>implementation. Difficulties of winning Russian and French support, and that of front </p>
<p>line states, very real.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Mr Hoon stated that there were only “limited grounds for optimism” that front line </p>
<p>states would implement new measures to clamp down on oil smuggling, particularly in </p>
<p>the context of regional attitudes to the intifada in the Palestinian Occupied Territories.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> Mr Hoon recognised Mr Cook’s “frustration with the No-Fly Zones”, but disagreed </p>
<p>with his position. In Mr Hoon’s view, the arguments for the NFZs, both humanitarian and </p>
<p>defensive, remained powerful and no less risky means of achieving those objectives had </p>
<p>been identified:</p>
<p>“Military commanders are already charged with conducting the mission we have </p>
<p>laid upon them with minimum profile and risk. We have made progress over the </p>
<p>past two years bearing down on patrolling rates, reducing responses to Iraqi </p>
<p>threats, and making increased use of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for tactical </p>
<p>reconnaissance. But I do not think that looking yet again at patrolling, with a view </p>
<p>to reducing or even ending it, would be productive. The arguments for maintaining </p>
<p>the No-Fly Zones are based on the assessed continued humanitarian requirement, </p>
<p>the importance of the southern Zone for the defence of Kuwait, and the desire </p>
<p>to avoid handing Saddam a victory which might undermine containment. These </p>
<p>remain powerful. While I accept that our view is not universally shared, it remains </p>
<p>that the Zones continue to be legally justified. We have asked officials to identify </p>
<p>a better (and less risky) means of achieving our objectives. Despite exhaustive </p>
<p>scrutiny, they have not found one: their consistent advice is that regular patrols are </p>
<p>required both to achieve the task and in order effectively – and safely – to monitor </p>
<p>the threat. Decisions about patrolling rates must remain the preserve of the military </p>
<p>commander, who must balance risk against exposure to the threat.” </p>
<p><b>293. </b> Mr Hoon expressed his concern that the US Administration might pick up “mixed </p>
<p>messages about our commitment to continued military co-operation in this area”, which </p>
<p>he believed would be “very damaging” to the UK’s ability to influence US thinking and </p>
<p>“unhelpful” if it encouraged other P5 members to “introduce the future of the Zones into </p>
<p>the package”. </p>

<p><b>Early negotiations on a smarter sanctions resolution</b></p>
<p><b>294.  UK officials continued to work on a draft resolution (known informally as the </b></p>
<p><b>“Smart Sanctions” resolution) to reflect the new policy framework, based on a </b></p>
<p><b>new Goods Review List. </b></p>
<p><b>295. </b> The UK prepared a draft resolution for the P5 Political Directors meeting in New </p>
<p>York on 21 May.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> The UK intended that the draft resolution would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allow the export to Iraq of all goods other than WMD and military items through </p>
<p>fast-track procedures; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>introduce more tightly focused controls on “Iraq weapons” through agreement </p>
<p>on a “Controlled Goods List” of arms and items of WMD concern: the UK was </p>
<p>pressing the US not to insist on an “unreasonably long list”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>through agreement with Iraq’s neighbours, bring Iraq’s illegal oil exports within </p>
<p>the OFF programme; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>introduce strengthened monitoring of Iraq’s land, sea and air borders.</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“The Council remained deeply divided between those states which remained highly </p>
<p>suspicious of Iraqi activity, with intelligence showing evidence of continued Iraqi </p>
<p>interest in materials for sophisticated weapons programmes (the US, the UK and </p>
<p>one or two other western or western-oriented members of the Security Council), and </p>
<p>Russia, France, China and many developing world or middle-ground members of </p>
<p>the Council, who opposed the continuation of sanctions short of convincing evidence </p>
<p>that Iraq was continuing to breach Security Council resolutions in a way which </p>
<p>threatened international peace and security.”</p>

<p> It would be surprising if an agreement could be reached in the Security </p>

<p>throughout this period, believed the Iraqi line that the United States in particular was </p>
<p>trying to impose a punishment on Iraq by any means possible, that this continued </p>
<p>punishment was unjustified in the absence of clear evidence that WMD programmes </p>
<p>were being pursued and that the whole sanctions regime could be knocked aside, </p>
<p>under the force of international concern about the humanitarian situation, if the </p>
<p>Russians persisted with their tactics.”</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>307. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“The Russians were just not prepared, I think, in mid-2001 with a new American </p>
<p>administration, to be carried along into a recasting of the sanctions regime on Iraq </p>
<p>which would extend it without any clear measures, stepping stones, if you like, for </p>
<p>how Iraq could get out of the sanctions regime. They regarded it as one-sided in that </p>
<p>respect, whereas [resolution] 1284 had been comprehensive.”</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Sir Jeremy continued: </p>
<p>“They [the Russians] held out in July, they held out in November, and we wondered </p>
<p>whether we would ever get a sanctions regime.”</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry why he thought the Russians had maintained their </p>
<p>opposition to a “Smart Sanctions” regime: </p>
<p>“The real reason … conveyed … by senior Russians authoritatively, was that they </p>
<p>were concerned about their commercial position in Iraq and the Iraqis actually didn’t </p>
<p>want any change to the sanctions regime. The Iraqi regime was comfortable … we </p>
<p>understood that the Iraqis actually threatened to cut off all Russia’s contracts if they </p>
<p>agreed to the modification of sanctions, and the Russians were fairly open with us </p>
<p>about that.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>310. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Ross if the Russian attitude had affected US policy.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> He told </p>
<p>the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I think it did … I think it built US suspicions of the Security Council as a place to do </p>
<p>business … which undermined at a critical period the US intention to use the Council </p>
<p>and to use UNMOVIC as an avenue for its policy of containing Iraq. </p>
<p>“I think they [the US] felt that … even when they were easing sanctions, they hit a </p>
<p>Russian blockage in the Security Council and that caused considerable frustration in </p>
<p>Washington, but also provided a lot of ammunition to the neo-cons and other people </p>

<p>252</p>
<p><b>320. </b> The FCO briefing advised that gaining the co-operation of some of Iraq’s </p>

<p>working … and should be replaced”, and that there was momentum behind the policy.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>323. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock gave the Inquiry a more pessimistic view:</p>
<p>“The Oil-for-Food regime was … rolled over for six months at the beginning of  </p>
<p>July 2001 with no prospect of this stalemate being ended even in the following  </p>
<p>six-month period.</p>
<p>“… this was quite a low point in the saga of the Security Council’s activities on Iraq, </p>
<p>since it seemed that there was no way forward on any of the potential tracks.</p>
<p>“The UK concluded from this experience that it was going to be extremely difficult to </p>
<p>end the fundamental stalemate at the Security Council over Iraqi sanctions … with </p>
<p>the failure of the Security Council to reach any form of agreement on Iraq’s future, </p>
<p>we were looking at the prospect of a continued unravelling of the sanctions regime, </p>
<p>of growing confidence in Baghdad that they could outwit the international community </p>
<p>and of a real prospect that, over time, Iraq would be able to reconstitute some of  </p>
<p>the programmes which had been destroyed after 1991. In the summer of 2001,  </p>

<p><b>326. </b> The record of Mr Blair’s discussions with President Putin in the margins of the </p>
<p>G8 meeting in Genoa on 21 July verifies Mr Blair’s and Mr Sawers’ accounts.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>priority was to stop Iraq acquiring nuclear weapons. Mr Blair observed that Iraq had </p>
<p>rejected proposals to allow UN observers to return as a first step to lifting sanctions, </p>
<p>and that the proposals on the table were to move to interim arrangements before UN </p>
<p>inspectors returned and sanctions were lifted. In addition, the issue of whether an </p>
<p>“outside enemy” led to people “rallying round and allowed Saddam to justify his strict </p>
<p>internal regime” was raised. Mr Blair was concerned about the humanitarian impact of </p>
<p>sanctions; and that the situation in Iraq made stabilising the Middle East more difficult. </p>
<p>Mr Sawers concluded that Russia was looking for a way out of the impasse. </p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 25 July 2001</b></p>
<p><b>327. </b> On 25 May, the JIC assessed Saddam Hussein’s strategy and “the continuing </p>
<p>erosion of sanctions”.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> That Assessment is addressed in the Box below. </p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 25 July 2001:  </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq: Continuing Erosion of Sanctions’ </b></p>
<p>The JIC assumed, for the purposes of its Assessment, that there would be no change to </p>
<p>the existing sanctions regime until the end of the year. It did not assess the prospects for </p>
<p>achieving P5 unity and the UK’s “new approach” in that timescale. </p>
<p>The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Most Governments around the world still respect UN sanctions</b>. Around </p>
<p>80 percent of Iraq’s overall revenues are controlled through [the] Oil-for-Food </p>
<p>[programme] … There is broad international consensus to maintain the <b>arms </b></p>
<p><b>embargo</b> at least as long as Saddam [Hussein] remains in power. This severely  </p>
<p>limits Iraq’s ability to re-build its military threat.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Nevertheless, the effectiveness of sanctions continues to erode</b> … Iraq’s </p>
<p>illicit earnings are likely to exceed US$3bn this year …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Syria, Jordan and Turkey benefited “from cheap Iraqi oil and associated trade </p>
<p>with Iraq. In the absence of compensation or P5 unity, they will remain <b>reluctant </b></p>
<p><b>to support revised sanctions or allow closer monitoring of trade</b>.” Regional </p>
<p>support for revising sanctions would be “increasingly difficult to achieve” as </p>
<p>Iraq extended “trade benefits to more Arab states” and the Palestinian crisis </p>
<p>continued.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… <b>Russia </b>blocked a revised UN sanctions regime because it believed its trade </p>
<p>prospects would be severely curtailed. But Russia may not feel able to stand in </p>
<p>the way of a further resolution on sanctions.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Iraq’s isolation has diminished</b> … Wider Arab sympathy for Iraq is bolstered </p>
<p>by Saddam’s championing of Palestinian rights, the widespread Arab perception  </p>

<p>254</p>
<p>that the US is compromised by its support for Israel, and false propaganda about </p>
<p>incidents in the No-Fly Zones.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam would only accept the return of UN weapons inspectors if it were </p>
<p>accompanied by the <b>immediate suspension of sanctions</b>, with a clear </p>
<p>timetable for their lift. He would also demand access to oil revenues and try </p>
<p>to obtain abolition of the No-Fly Zones.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“For now, Saddam will avoid measures that would unite the wider Arab world </p>
<p>against him and undermine his efforts to build regional economic ties. This will </p>
<p>further reduce the risk of military threats to Kuwait or Saudi Arabia. But he will </p>
<p>seek to shoot down coalition aircraft in the No-Fly Zones.”</p>
<p>The JIC stated that while Iraq’s illegal income was increasing, its income under the OFF </p>
<p>programme was likely to fall from US$17bn in 2000 to US$14bn in 2001, largely as a </p>
<p>result of Iraq’s temporary suspension of oil deliveries under the OFF programme. </p>
<p>Syria was now “<b>the largest purchaser of illicit Iraqi oil</b>” and was “becoming a more </p>
<p>favoured route for the supply of military spare parts, telecommunications equipment </p>
<p>and chemicals to Iraq”. There was “scope for the illegal trade … to grow further … in the </p>
<p>medium term there are plans for a new pipeline and additional road and rail links”. </p>
<p>Most of those who dealt with Iraq had not changed their minds about Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>He had “no friends in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait” and he distrusted “both King Abdullah of </p>
<p>Jordan and President Bashar [al-Assad] of Syria”. But his strategy was “<b>to place Syria </b></p>
<p><b>and Jordan under greater obligation than the west or Gulf States will be willing to </b></p>
<p><b>buy out</b>”. </p>
<p>The “widespread renewal of Iraq’s diplomatic contacts” in 2000 had been extended in </p>
<p>2001 “by a variety of bilateral and multilateral meetings mainly to develop economic </p>
<p>relations”. International flights were continuing with Iraq-based civil aircraft flying between </p>
<p>Baghdad and Damascus “three or four times a week” with “a similar number of foreign </p>
<p>aircraft” flying “into Baghdad mainly from Russia, Turkey and other Arab countries”. </p>
<p>“Three ferries a week” operated “between the UAE, Bahrain and Iraq” which were “largely </p>
<p>unregulated”. </p>
<p>The JIC stated that: </p>
<p>“The regime feels stronger for having an external enemy and the elite is profiting. All </p>
<p>of Saddam’s close associates have become $ millionaires through sanctions breaking </p>
<p>trade … </p>
<p>“… Saddam judges his position to be the strongest since the Gulf War. Although </p>
<p>much of this is based on regional dependence on illicit oil, the regime is secure …”</p>

<p>confirming that Lord Williams accepted “that it is still <b>possible</b> on balance to </p>
<p>argue that the maintenance of the No-Fly Zones is justified as a necessary and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>emphasising “that it is vitally important to keep constantly in view the precarious </p>
<p>nature of the legal basis for UK and US action in the No-Fly Zones”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asking for an “update of the situation in the north and south of Iraq, </p>
<p>consideration of alternatives to the maintenance of the Zones, and information </p>
<p>on any civilian casualties associated with UK and US operations in relation to </p>
<p>the Zones”, by the end of May 2001. </p>

<p>provided on 8 February (and which had been endorsed by Mr Cook and Mr Straw), but </p>
<p>offered an update on the points made in that letter: </p>
<p>“Although we cannot predict with absolute certainty how Saddam would react in </p>
<p>the event of a cessation of coalition operations in the southern No-Fly Zone, our </p>
<p>judgement remains that he would revert to the use of air power against the  </p>
<p>Shia population …</p>
<p>“… more effective persecution of the Shia would add to their misery and would risk </p>
<p>provoking another cycle of uprising and brutal repression. A grave humanitarian </p>
<p>crisis would result … </p>
<p>“There is no reason to call into question the JIC judgement … that abolition of the </p>
<p>northern No-Fly Zone would be likely to lead to a refugee crisis at least comparable </p>
<p>to 1996 (nor that, in the event that Saddam faced widespread opposition to an </p>
<p>assault to recover the north, a humanitarian refugee crisis similar to that in 1991 </p>
<p>would follow).</p>

<p>“Our judgement in February was that a decision to move away from patrolling the </p>
<p>south would make it more difficult to sustain the necessary political support for the </p>
<p>northern No-Fly Zone. That remains our view.</p>
<p>“Overall, our continued collective judgement is that there remains an unacceptably </p>
<p>high risk that, in the event that we ceased patrolling the southern No-Fly Zone, </p>
<p>extreme humanitarian distress would result on a scale comparable to that which  </p>
<p>led to a grave humanitarian crisis and the establishment of the Zones in 1991  </p>
<p>and 1992.”</p>
<p><b>334. </b> Addressing Lord Williams’ request that officials “should continue to seek to </p>
<p>establish whether alternatives methods [to the NFZs] to achieve our objectives could be </p>
<p>identified”, Mr McKane stated:</p>
<p>“… the MOD has conducted a comprehensive review to inform the policy dialogue </p>
<p>we have been engaged in with the new US Administration. After our own careful </p>
<p>and detailed scrutiny, no other arrangements that would obviate the need to conduct </p>
<p>regular patrols over Iraqi territory have been identified.”</p>
<p><b>335. </b> Mr McKane confirmed that the need “to avoid incidental loss of civilian life, </p>
<p>injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects” remained a key concern for coalition </p>
<p>commanders in the planning and implementation of attacks.</p>
<p><b>336. </b> Mr Brummell responded on 25 July.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> Noting that there was no change to the </p>
<p>assessment of 8 June, he wrote:</p>
<p>“As discussed, the new Attorney General will wish to consider in the near future the </p>

<p> The advice stated that the MOD was not yet in a position </p>

<p><b>339. </b> Reports of a “planned large-scale military response to recent events in the </p>
<p>southern No-Fly Zone”, “sourced to the Pentagon”, appeared in the media on 27 July.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>340. </b> Mr McKane wrote to No.10 on 1 August, advising that military planners within the </p>
<p>Pentagon and the MOD had discussed options. The Pentagon option was for a raid </p>
<p>involving attacks on 30 targets, two-thirds of which were north of the southern No-Fly </p>
<p>Zone and within 20 miles of Baghdad. The UK preference was to attack 20 targets,  </p>
<p>12 of which lay within 20 miles of Baghdad. Each of the proposed targets was connected </p>
<p>with the Iraqi air-defence system though two were in the vicinity of the civilian airports  </p>
<p>at Baghdad and Basra which had civilian as well as military roles.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>341. </b> Lord Goldsmith was provided with written briefing on the US proposals and met </p>
<p>MOD officials on 1 and 8 August.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>342. </b> An official in Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to No.10 on 2 August setting out  </p>
<p>the issues: </p>
<p>“Whilst coalition aircraft have continued to come under regular attack by the Iraqi </p>
<p>air defences, the military assessment was until very recently that the overall risk </p>
<p>remained manageable. Events over recent weeks have, however, brought this into </p>
<p>question, with July seeing an alarming increase in the number of occasions on which </p>
<p>coalition aircraft have narrowly avoided being shot down (ten separate incidents in </p>
<p>the south alone, compared to eleven in the previous four months combined).”</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>343. </b> The increased risk reflected greater Iraqi capability and “coalition restraint over the </p>
<p>past three months”. </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Decisions on the operation were likely to be delayed by US concern about the </p>
<p>reaction of “moderate Arab governments” which were “already under pressure as a </p>
<p>result of developments in Israel and Palestine”, and by the US appreciation of the likely </p>
<p>propaganda benefits to Saddam Hussein from such attacks. The debate within the US </p>
<p>Administration on how to respond to the attacks on coalition aircraft had broadened into </p>
<p>a wider one about the direction of US policy, “with advocates of hitting Saddam harder </p>
<p>using this as an opportunity to move the argument in that direction”.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office concluded: </p>
<p>“The Defence Secretary is convinced of the need, in the face of the substantially </p>
<p>increased threat, to take action to reduce the risk to the Service Personnel </p>
<p>conducting this task [patrolling the Zones]. Whilst he understands the political </p>
<p>and presentational arguments for delay, his preference would have been for a </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>substantial operation designed to achieve this (indeed, he has asked for the views </p>
<p>of the Attorney General on a UK-prepared plan to attack 21 targets). He accepts the </p>
<p>military advice that only by conducting such an operation, including against targets </p>
<p>north of the 33rd parallel, can we expect to reduce the threat substantially in the </p>
<p>medium term. But he accepts that, just as in the US, time will be required to afford </p>
<p>collective consideration of such a proposal. He believes that this is an issue to which </p>
<p>we will need to return in the future.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, he is clear that the status quo is not an option, and that a robust </p>
<p>return to the existing agreed concept of operations is essential … to enable the </p>
<p>coalition to manage the enhanced risk in the immediate term.” </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Mr Patey reported on 3 August that the US had decided not to carry out the </p>
<p>proposed operation, pending consideration of its wider implications.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> He described it as </p>
<p>“welcome news”. </p>
<p><b>347. </b> The MOD proposed to return to the level of operations within the NFZs before the </p>
<p>constraints imposed following the February attack. That would raise the profile of the </p>
<p>NFZs, but the FCO believed that the UK should be able to portray that as a legitimate </p>
<p>and proportionate response to the increased threat to air crew. </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office wrote to No.10 later that day, acknowledging the increase </p>
<p>in the threat and that military commanders should use their delegated authority to take </p>
<p>actions within the NFZs to minimise the risk to air crews.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> Mr Straw was concerned that </p>
<p>a major attack should not be initiated:</p>
<p>“… without considering carefully the implications for our wider interests.</p>
<p>“… A more substantial operation … would bring into stark relief arguments about </p>
<p>double standards and inflame Arab public opinion. We might face attacks on UK … </p>
<p>Embassies and other interests in the region. We owe a duty of care to our staff and </p>
<p>to British citizens in the region, as well as to our aircrews. </p>
<p>“Politically, a major operation north of the southern NFZ would play straight into </p>
<p>Saddam’s hands … UK domestic and international reaction following the February </p>
<p>attacks was hostile …</p>
<p>“Such an operation could also prove fatal to our current Iraq policy … a major </p>
<p>operation would be interpreted as a get-tough policy by the US in frustration at the </p>
<p>failure to get our revised sanctions approach agreed … The collapse of our current </p>
<p>policy, which has been carefully considered and agreed in Whitehall and with the </p>
<p>US, would leave us in a policy vacuum in which we would risk getting sucked into </p>
<p>adopting a more militaristic posture.</p>

<p>“… the balance of advantage to maintaining the NFZs would require the most careful </p>
<p>consideration.” </p>
<p><b>349. </b> On 3 August, an official in the British Embassy Washington reported that one </p>
<p>senior US official had said that the debate over the proposed attacks had “given greater </p>
<p>impetus” to the need to develop the overall US strategy on Iraq; and that substantive </p>
<p>outcomes were “unlikely in days, but possible in weeks”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>350. </b> Mr Brummell wrote to the MOD on 9 August, setting out Lord Goldsmith’s views.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had concluded “that proportionate attacks by UK forces on the … two </p>
<p>targets could be justified in the context of Allied operations in the southern No-Fly Zone”. </p>
<p><b>351. </b> Mr Brummell also set out Lord Goldsmith’s views on proposed attacks by US </p>
<p>forces. Referring to earlier correspondence with the FCO, Mr Brummell noted the UK’s </p>
<p>“potential international legal responsibility” for attacks carried out by the US in the NFZs, </p>
<p>and, with regard to the planned action, “the assurances provided by the US that, in </p>
<p>relation to all three proposed targets, no civilian casualties may be expected to result </p>
<p>from the attacks and that there may be expected no more than minor damage to civilian </p>
<p>buildings and facilities”. On that basis, the Attorney General had advised: “Provided the </p>
<p>responsible senior Ministers are satisfied that these US projections are reliable, and that </p>
<p>the US Government are satisfied as to the lawfulness of the proposed attacks”, he saw </p>
<p>no reason to question that “proportionate attacks by US forces on the … targets … could </p>
<p>be justified in the context of Allied operations in the southern No-Fly Zone”. </p>
<p><b>352. </b> A number of attacks were carried out on 10 August, including an attack by the  </p>
<p>US on a target previously assigned to UK forces. That attack was carried out during </p>
<p>daylight hours. </p>
<p><b>353. </b> Mr Brummell wrote to the MOD on 15 August referring to the concerns the Attorney </p>
<p>General had expressed in giving his consent, regarding the importance he had attached </p>
<p>to the MOD’s assurance that the attack would be carried out at night to avoid the risk of </p>
<p>harm to people working in the vicinity of the buildings.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> MOD officials had also made </p>
<p>clear that any change in circumstances would be brought to the Attorney General’s </p>
<p>attention. Mr Brummell recorded that Lord Goldsmith had asked that the written report </p>
<p>on the attacks should address the points he had raised; and that his concerns should be </p>
<p>drawn to Mr Hoon’s attention. </p>
<p><b>354. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office replied to Mr Brummell on 3 September.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> The letter </p>
<p>stressed the importance that Mr Hoon attached to the Law Officers’ advice and that </p>
<p>he was fully aware of the need to ensure that the actions of coalition partners were </p>
<p>“governed by similar principles”. Mr Hoon was “confident that US commanders are very </p>

<p>modelling and have the benefit of a much greater range of weaponeering solutions </p>
<p>than assessments made by the UK targeting staff in respect of RAF targets”. The letter </p>
<p>concluded that: “In circumstances … where there is … no clear reason to challenge </p>
<p>US targeting judgements, he [Mr Hoon] takes the view that we should take on trust </p>
<p>assurances provided by … our closest ally.”</p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s review</b></p>
<p><b>355. </b> Mr Brummell wrote to Mr McKane on 24 August informing him that Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>intended to carry out his review of the legal justification for the maintenance of the </p>
<p>NFZs during September; and that he had asked whether there was any additional </p>
<p>information which departments wished to draw to his attention, and whether there were </p>
<p>any developments subsequent to Mr McKane’s update of 28 June.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> Copies of the letter </p>
<p>were sent to the MOD, the FCO and No.10 officials.</p>
<p><b>356. </b> Mr Brummell also asked for clarification on a number of specific points:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether departments could “expand on the assessment that a decision to </p>
<p>move away from patrolling the south would make it more difficult to sustain the </p>
<p>necessary political support for the northern No-Fly Zone”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether it was possible to expand the assessment of the “<i>likelihood</i>” of a “grave </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis” occurring as a result of persecution of the Shia. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether departments could direct him “to the precise materials and/or </p>
<p>passages” in “the MOD’s comprehensive review of the Zones” on which the </p>
<p>conclusion that “no other arrangements have been identified which would </p>
<p>obviate the need to conduct regular patrols over Iraqi territory” had been based. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether the assessment in Mr Patey’s letter of 29 January that there might </p>
<p>be “scope for adjustment” in relation to the northern NFZ remained valid, and </p>
<p>if it did whether it affected “the assessment of whether there are any practical </p>
<p>alternatives to patrolling the northern No-Fly Zone if lives are to be saved”. </p>
<p><b>357. </b> Mr McKane forwarded a copy of the letter to Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Foreign Policy Adviser, with the comment:</p>
<p>“You need to be aware of this correspondence. I’ve got the matter in hand – </p>
<p>I’ll probably ask the MOD to produce a draft reply for discussion with them and FCO </p>
<p>– but I may need to ask you to weigh in if the Attorney is unconvinced by  </p>
<p>our arguments.”</p>

<p><b>Discussions on a new contingency plan for the loss of an aircraft  </b></p>
<p><b>in Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>360. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that, in the event of a coalition plane being shot down in </p>
<p>the NFZs:</p>
<p>“We had a contingency plan … which was run from the joint headquarters in Saudi </p>
<p>Arabia. The objective would have been the safety of the air crew … to basically go </p>
<p>and get them back if wounded on the ground inside Iraq, whether or not the Iraqis </p>
<p>tried to stop us doing it … it is called ‘combat search and rescue’ … it was on stand </p>
<p>by all the time these [NFZ] operations were being flown and it didn’t need Ministerial </p>
<p>authorisation to go out and do that, and, as I’m implying, as well as just getting in </p>
<p>there and picking up the air crew and looking after them medically, if necessary, we </p>
<p>would have kept the Iraqi forces away … there was a debate to be had … of what’s </p>
<p>necessary to keep the – if I might put it like this – Iraqi forces’ head[s] down while </p>
<p>we went and recovered the crew, as opposed to also signalling that we wished they </p>
<p>would not do it again.”</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>361.  In late summer 2001, reports on US contingency planning for the loss of </b></p>
<p><b>aircraft caused concern within the UK Government. </b></p>
<p><b>362. </b> On 29 August, Mr Webb advised Mr Robert Cooper, Head of the Overseas and </p>
<p>Defence Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, that the US Central Command (CENTCOM) </p>
<p>had reviewed its contingency plans for the loss of a coalition aircraft in the NFZs.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The revised plan, understood to have been endorsed in principle, “provides for a major </p>
<p>offensive operation, distinct from measures taken to recover downed aircrew, against a </p>
<p>wide range of targets across Iraq within four hours of a shoot-down being confirmed”. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Mr Webb described the US proposals as “of a piece with DoD [US Department </p>
<p>of Defense] ideas on future responses to Iraqi threats (‘more savage, less often’)”. The </p>
<p>main legal concern was the breadth of the list of targets within Baghdad included in the </p>
<p>revised plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>364. </b> In a manuscript note on his copy of Mr Webb’s letter, Mr Stephen Wright,  </p>
<p>FCO Deputy Under Secretary of State (Defence and Intelligence), asked Mr Patey for </p>
<p>advice, adding: </p>
<p>“On the substance, I think we should strongly advise the US against their proposed </p>
<p>strategy: it is politically and legally all wrong for both the US and the UK.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Wright responded to Mr Webb’s letter on 5 September, emphasising the </p>
<p>importance of understanding how any operation “might impact not only on our Iraq policy </p>
<p>but on the region as a whole”.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>366. </b> Discussions between the UK and US on the proposed contingency plans continued </p>
<p>for some months, and at the highest levels. The UK’s objective was to moderate the  </p>
<p>US proposals. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> The matter was not resolved until July 2002. </p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary reported to Sir David Manning on 22 July 2002 that </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had agreed to UK participation in attacking the target set, with the </p>
<p>exception of three regime targets which would be attacked by the US.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> In the event of </p>
<p>a legal challenge, the Attorney General had advised that there would be a need for the </p>
<p>UK to disassociate itself from that part of the action. That could damage US/UK bilateral </p>
<p>relations. Mr Hoon proposed that the UK should agree a joint US/UK plan on that basis. </p>
<p><b>369. </b> Mr Blair agreed.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>370. </b> The circumstances in which the plan needed to be implemented did not arise.</p>
<p><b>Developments in the US</b></p>
<p><b>371. </b> In early August, the British Embassy Washington reported that it appeared that a </p>
<p>debate was heating up in Washington on the balance between different strands of US </p>
<p>policy (sanctions, military containment and regime change).</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>372. </b> In a discussion with Mr Webb in mid-August, a senior Pentagon official stated that </p>
<p>regime change was needed to prevent Iraq from acquiring a credible WMD capacity and </p>
<p>becoming the dominant regional power.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>373. </b> In early September, a senior State Department official advised the British Embassy </p>
<p>Washington that activity on ideas for regime change was “much ado about nothing”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Published American accounts described this debate. On 1 August, a paper entitled </p>
<p>‘A Liberation Strategy’ was presented to the National Security Council.</p>

<p><b>375. </b> Mr George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, described in his memoir </p>
<p>how a CIA analysis before 9/11 concluded that it would be difficult to remove Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein because of the layers of security around him and that: “Even if we had </p>
<p>managed to take Saddam out, the beneficiary was likely to have been another Sunni </p>
<p>general no better than the man he replaced.”</p>
<p>207</p>
<p><b>376. </b> General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief CENTCOM, told the </p>
<p>9/11 Commission that in the summer before 9/11 he had been pushing to do more </p>
<p>robust planning on military responses in Iraq, but that President Bush had denied his </p>
<p>request, arguing that the time was not right.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> Gen Franks also told the Commission that </p>
<p>CENTCOM had begun to dust off plans for a full invasion of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> The then Head of Policy Planning in the US State Department, Mr Richard Haass, </p>
<p>recorded that he submitted a memo to Secretary Powell arguing that “Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was a nuisance, not a mortal threat”, and that the only sure way of ousting him would be </p>
<p>through prolonged military occupation and nation-building.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>378. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised on 6 September that “our goals are to contain Iraqi </p>
<p>military/WMD potential and constrict Baghdad’s financial flexibility, without excessively </p>
<p>harming the Iraqi people”.</p>

<p> He argued that the issue needed to be given a higher </p>
<p>priority in the US/Russian agenda and noted that Mr Goulty was due to hold talks in </p>
<p>Moscow later that month.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> The talks took place on 11 September 2001. Just after they had finished, the news </p>
<p>reached Moscow of the terrorist attacks in the US. </p>
<p><b>380. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir Peter Ricketts if the failure to secure agreement to a new </p>
<p>resolution in July changed US policy. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Yes, I think it probably did. I don’t think it helped Colin Powell’s position in </p>
<p>Washington, frankly, that he had … not been able to give this containment policy </p>
<p>a refresh through the sanctions resolution. I don’t think it led to an immediate shift </p>
<p>in American policy because I remember, as 9/11 happened, we and the Americans </p>
<p>were still working on further pushes with the Russians to see whether we could get </p>
<p>a Goods Review List resolution through in the autumn, but I think it didn’t help the </p>
<p>cause of the State Department that the flagship of this strengthened containment </p>
<p>policy had not succeeded by July.”</p>
