<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section contains the Inquiry’s analysis, conclusions and lessons in relation to the </p>
<p>deployment of civilian personnel in Iraq, the evidence for which is set out in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the recruitment, deployment or impact of UK police officers in Iraq, addressed in </p>
<p>Section 12;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether sufficient civilian personnel were deployed to achieve the UK’s </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq, or the contribution that civilian personnel made to Iraq’s </p>
<p>reconstruction, both addressed in Section 10;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the funding of civilian deployments, including the cost of protective security </p>
<p>measures, addressed in Section 13; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s reviews of the UK approach to post-conflict reconstruction and </p>
<p>stabilisation, and the creation of a deployable UK civilian stand-by capability, </p>
<p>addressed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Before the invasion of Iraq, the Government had made only minimal preparations for </p>
<p>the deployment of civilian personnel.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was an enduring gap between the Government’s civilian capacity and the level </p>
<p>of its ambition in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no overarching consideration by the Government of the extent to which </p>
<p>civilians could be effective in a highly insecure environment, or of the security assets </p>
<p>needed for civilians to do their jobs effectively.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that the Government recognised its duty </p>
<p>of care to UK-based and locally engaged civilians in Iraq. A significant effort was </p>
<p>made to keep civilians safe in a dangerous environment.</p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> Between 2003 and 2009, UK and Iraqi civilian personnel made an essential </p>
<p>contribution to the UK’s efforts to help rebuild Iraq. They often did so in extremely </p>
<p>dangerous circumstances. Some locally engaged (LE) staff and UK-based contractors </p>
<p>lost their lives.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The initial deployment of only a handful of civilian personnel reflected pre-invasion </p>
<p>assumptions about the limited extent of the likely UK contribution to the post-conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction and administration of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> Soon after the invasion, Mr Blair called for a significant increase in the UK civilian </p>
<p>effort. Further calls to strengthen the UK civilian presence in Iraq followed.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>15.2  |  Conclusions: Civilian personnel</p>
<p>413</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The Government had no pre-existing machinery for recruiting and deploying at speed </p>
<p>large numbers of civilians with the appropriate skills. As a result, efforts to deploy larger </p>
<p>numbers of civilians to Iraq fell well short of targets.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> There was a particular shortage of Arabic speakers and reconstruction expertise.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> From late summer 2003, concern about staff safety led to the progressive </p>
<p>introduction of protective security measures for civilian personnel in Iraq and placed </p>
<p>additional constraints on civilian deployments.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Government departments recognised their duty of care obligations to personnel </p>
<p>working in Iraq. Significant effort and resources went into keeping staff safe.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> In the absence of a government-wide approach to risk or an effective framework </p>
<p>for assessing the value of civilian personnel in a highly insecure environment, the </p>
<p>Government struggled to establish a co-ordinated approach to the deployment </p>
<p>of civilians.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> The Iraq Reconstruction Service Medal and the Locally Engaged Staff Assistance </p>
<p>Scheme were appropriate responses to the issues they addressed.</p>
<p><b>Pre-invasion planning and preparation</b></p>
<p><b>12. </b> Sections 6.4 and 6.5 address the UK’s pre-invasion planning and preparation </p>
<p>for its role in the Occupation of Iraq. In the absence of effective cross-government </p>
<p>machinery for drawing together all aspects of planning and preparation, the Foreign and </p>
<p>Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Department for </p>
<p>International Development (DFID) pursued broadly complementary objectives, but did so </p>
<p>separately. This left significant gaps in UK civilian capabilities that were overlooked.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The UK did not plan or prepare for the deployment of more than a handful of </p>
<p>civilians to Iraq, other than in direct support of military operations.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The FCO was not equipped by past experience or practice, or by its limited human </p>
<p>and financial resources, to prepare for nation-building of the scale required in Iraq, and </p>
<p>did not expect to do so.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> The FCO did make effective preparations, however, for resuming diplomatic </p>
<p>representation in Baghdad. The British Office Baghdad opened, on schedule, on </p>
<p>5 May 2003.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> DFID was reluctant, before the invasion, to engage in planning and preparation for </p>
<p>anything other than the immediate humanitarian response to conflict.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> DFID did, however, make pre-conflict preparations to support those multilateral </p>
<p>institutions providing humanitarian assistance in Iraq and the region.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>18. </b> The MOD made provision for civilian support to military operations in Iraq, as it </p>
<p>would for any military operation. Military planners identified and drew attention to the </p>
<p>gap in those UK civilian capabilities that would be needed for post-conflict reconstruction </p>
<p>and administration.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Neither the FCO nor DFID took responsibility for addressing that gap.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> The shortage of the requisite civilian expertise within government was a significant </p>
<p>constraint on the planning and preparation for post-conflict operations and on the </p>
<p>eventual scale of the UK civilian contribution.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The review of the UK’s approach to post-conflict reconstruction, begun in September </p>
<p>2003, addressed the management of the UK’s contribution, including “the identification </p>
<p>and training of civilian personnel and the maintenance of databases, with deployable </p>
<p>capability”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>22. </b> Although successive reviews changed significantly the UK’s approach to </p>
<p>reconstruction and stabilisation, they had limited impact on the UK’s civilian deployment </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Meeting the initial demand for civilian personnel in Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>23. </b> The Inquiry estimates that, on the eve of the invasion, the UK had between </p>
<p>10 and 16 non-MOD civilians ready to deploy to Iraq. That very small number reflected </p>
<p>the assumptions underpinning UK planning and preparation for post-conflict Iraq, </p>
<p>including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>after a short period of US-led, UN-authorised military occupation, the UN would </p>
<p>administer and provide a framework for the reconstruction of post-conflict Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>substantial international support would follow UN authorisation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reconstruction and the political transition to Iraqi rule would proceed in a secure </p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> Between April and October 2003, Ministers and officials pressed for an increase in </p>
<p>the UK civilian deployments to the US-led Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p>
<p>Assistance (ORHA) and its successor, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), in </p>
<p>Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Government departments were not equipped to respond to those demands.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> On 17 April, Mr Blair agreed that the UK should “increase significantly the level of … </p>
<p>political and practical support to ORHA, including the secondment of significant numbers </p>
<p>of staff in priority areas”.</p>

<p>15.2  |  Conclusions: Civilian personnel</p>
<p>415</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The FCO, under the direction of Sir Michael Jay, the Permanent Under Secretary, </p>
<p>co-ordinated the Whitehall response.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The FCO’s approach was ad hoc, reflecting the absence of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adequate pre-invasion planning;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a Whitehall mechanism for co-ordinating the urgent recruitment of volunteers; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clear US job descriptions for the vacant ORHA/CPA posts in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> On 22 April, with no clear job descriptions to draw on, Sir Michael Jay called on </p>
<p>departments to “take a broad view in looking for volunteers”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> He stated that “enthusiasm </p>
<p>and personal qualities are likely to be just as important as specific expertise”.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Officials informed the 22 May meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>Rehabilitation (AHMGIR) that 61 UK officials had been seconded to ORHA, five of them </p>
<p>in Basra. Officials were able to provide Ministers with only very basic information on </p>
<p>the functions of 35 of the 61, explaining: “Some secondees have yet to be allocated </p>
<p>specific roles.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>31. </b> On 25 July, Sir Michael Jay described the training and deployment since April of </p>
<p>“over 100 civilian staff from sixteen different branches of government” as an exercise </p>
<p>having “no modern precedent”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>32. </b> While recognising that some of the difficulties faced by the UK reflected </p>
<p>shortcomings in US plans, the Inquiry considers the deployment to have been </p>
<p>unsatisfactory. Volunteers appear to have been recruited in a hasty and haphazard </p>
<p>manner, without procedures to assess their suitability for a very challenging task. </p>
<p>Civilians arrived in Iraq more slowly than required, with inadequate preparation and </p>
<p>to fill positions that were ill defined.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> As early as June 2003, concerns emerged that some civilians deployed to Iraq </p>
<p>were not capable of meeting the physical requirements of working in such a difficult </p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> Ms Emma Sky, CPA Governorate Co-ordinator for Kirkuk from June 2003 to </p>
<p>February 2004, told the Inquiry that she was not given a briefing by the FCO before </p>
<p>travelling to Iraq. Instead she had received a phone call telling her “You’ve spent a </p>
<p>lot of time in the Middle East. You will be fine.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Between June and August 2003, Ministers and officials pressed for a more </p>
<p>ambitious response to the demand for civilian personnel. The UK sought to deploy </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p>individuals with the right skills and appropriate levels of seniority, and to provide </p>
<p>leadership by appointing a UK Head of CPA(South):</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 3 June, Mr Blair called for Whitehall to return to a “war footing”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>needed to be “a strong civilian team in the South. In general, there needed to be </p>
<p>a much stronger civilian grip”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 2 July, Baroness Amos, the International Development Secretary, </p>
<p>recommended the deployment of additional staff with the right skills and </p>
<p>seniority.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 10 July, Ministers agreed that the UK effort in the South should be increased </p>
<p>and that a UK figure should be made Head of CPA(South).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 28 August, the AHMGIR agreed, “subject to security concerns”, that </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott, Head of CPA(South), should be given “such assistance and </p>
<p>staff as he deemed necessary”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Departments did not rise to the challenge:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry that, on his arrival in Basra on 30 July: </p>
<p>“The phones didn’t work ... and nobody had thought to provide me with any form </p>
<p>of computer.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 5 September, Mr Neil Crompton, Head of the Iraq Policy Unit (IPU), reported </p>
<p>that the view in Iraq was that the job there was “doable”, but the UK needed </p>
<p>to “throw massive resources at the problem now”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> CPA(South) was “woefully </p>
<p>under-staffed”. It was clear that the UK would have to fill the positions itself </p>
<p>rather than rely on third-country nationals or CPA Baghdad.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 23 September, Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister’s Deputy Special </p>
<p>Representative on Iraq, reported that UK “influence in CPA Baghdad is limited; </p>
<p>we supply only 100 out of its 1,000 staff there”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry: “One of my key requests was at the end of </p>
<p>August when I asked for, I think, 37 additional expert staff ... By 1 January, </p>
<p>18 out of 37 had arrived.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Departments’ weak response to the instruction to strengthen the UK civilian </p>
<p>presence in Iraq represented a missed opportunity to alleviate some of the problems </p>
<p>created by the failures of pre-invasion planning and preparation.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> It is not possible to assert that the rapid deployment of all the additional personnel </p>
<p>requested would have materially altered the situation in Iraq. It is, however, the Inquiry’s </p>

<p>15.2  |  Conclusions: Civilian personnel</p>
<p>417</p>
<p>view that the UK’s ability to influence developments in Iraq was diminished by their </p>
<p>absence (see Section 9.8).</p>
<p><b>Duty of care and risk management</b></p>
<p><b>39. </b> Between 2003 and 2009, decisions on civilian deployment were closely linked to </p>
<p>assessments of the security threat in Iraq and departments’ interpretation of their duty of </p>
<p>care to staff.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Steps taken by departments to manage the threat to staff included the provision of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pre-deployment security training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>secure transport;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>close protection teams; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hardened accommodation.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Protective security could not eliminate the risk of death or injury. A number of </p>
<p>LE staff and UK-based contractors working for the UK Government were killed in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> The evidence available to the Inquiry shows that the Government made serious </p>
<p>efforts to mitigate the risk of injury and death. In addition to protective security measures:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO and DFID carried out frequent reviews of security in Baghdad, Basra </p>
<p>and other locations in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>During 2004, the FCO introduced improved structures for managing security </p>
<p>issues at its posts in Iraq, with responsibility shared between named </p>
<p>decision-makers in London and Iraq. Those arrangements were kept </p>
<p>under review.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When the threat was assessed to exceed the protection afforded by the security </p>
<p>measures in place, officials and, where appropriate, Ministers, took quick </p>
<p>decisions to lock down buildings or to withdraw staff temporarily.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> The number of civilian personnel in Baghdad and Basra fluctuated as Ministers and </p>
<p>officials sought to reconcile departments’ duty of care to staff with operational needs </p>
<p>and the finite resources available for enhanced security in the face of a constantly </p>
<p>evolving threat:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 27 May 2004, Mr Stuart Jack, Head of the FCO Iraq Operations Unit (IOU) </p>
<p>advised Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary: “we are currently at the limit of </p>
<p>technical measures we can apply to protect staff in Iraq”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 8 October 2004, officials advised Mr Straw that the FCO was “reaching the </p>
<p>limits” of its ability to increase effective protection.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>418</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 6 June 2006, Mr Andrew Noble, FCO Director of Security, stated: “we </p>
<p>are operating at the limits of what can be achieved, consistent with running a </p>
<p>diplomatic mission”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 22 January 2007, Dr Rosalind Marsden, the British Consul General in Basra, </p>
<p>reported that she had been advised by her Overseas Security Manager that “we </p>
<p>are beginning to push our luck”.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>44. </b> The critical contribution of some of the protective measures introduced in Iraq is </p>
<p>reflected in comments by Mr Robert Tinline, Head of the Basra Provincial Reconstruction </p>
<p>Team (PRT) in 2007 and 2008. In April 2007, he informed the FCO that more than </p>
<p>1,200 rockets and mortars had been fired at the Basra Palace site since September </p>
<p>2006.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> Although the BPC had been hit 70 times:</p>
<p>“We were fortunate that none of our staff were killed or injured ... But we also made </p>
<p>our own good fortune. Four accommodation ‘pods’, the bar, the gym and both the </p>
<p>main office buildings received direct hits – but because they were hardened, no </p>
<p>serious injuries resulted.”</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The progressive introduction of protective security measures between 2003 and </p>
<p>2008 placed growing constraints on civilians’ ability to carry out their jobs effectively.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> LE staff and contractors became critically important to the UK reconstruction effort.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> The limited availability of secure transport had particular consequences for the way </p>
<p>civilians operated.</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Martin Dinham, DFID Director Europe, Middle East and Americas from 2005 to </p>
<p>2007, told the Inquiry that, during 2006 and 2007, access to a number of infrastructure </p>
<p>projects was so difficult that “we had to arrange to work through local contractors … </p>
<p>taking videos, taking digital images, contacting us by email, meeting them in safe </p>
<p>locations so we could actually supervise at one remove”.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>49. </b> From mid-2003, officials had recognised that measures to protect civilians from </p>
<p>the security threat could have implications for the UK’s ability to achieve its strategic </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Despite the warnings, the Government failed to establish a strategic framework </p>
<p>for assessing the impact of the security threat and protective security measures on UK </p>
<p>objectives or to agree an appropriate response.</p>

<p>15.2  |  Conclusions: Civilian personnel</p>
<p>419</p>
<p><b>51. </b> In July 2003, Mr Peter Collecott, FCO Director General Corporate Affairs, </p>
<p>commented on the tension between achieving UK objectives in Iraq and duty of care </p>
<p>to staff. He advised Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“We will inevitably be faced with some very difficult prioritisation decisions: </p>
<p>activity v. security in Iraq; activity in Iraq v. priorities elsewhere.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Concerns increased after the attacks on the UN headquarters in Baghdad in </p>
<p>August 2003.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Mr Crompton advised Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“Resources for security assets are an issue. But the principle should be that we </p>
<p>provide the number of security assets we need for people to do their jobs properly, </p>
<p>rather than limit the number of tasks we take on to the number of security assets </p>
<p>we have on the ground (as some around Whitehall have been suggesting). This will </p>
<p>be expensive.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Over time, the tasks that UK civilians were able to carry out in Iraq became </p>
<p>increasingly limited. In June 2006, the IPU characterised the FCO approach to security </p>
<p>as “risk averse”.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> It stated that, where officials judged that a particular task exposed </p>
<p>personnel to greater risk than the mitigating measures in place to deal with that risk, the </p>
<p>task would not be undertaken.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The withdrawal of the majority of civilian staff from the Basra Palace site to Basra Air </p>
<p>Station and Kuwait in response to a rapid deterioration in security in late 2006 followed </p>
<p>that pattern.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry that he was clear that the British Embassy Office </p>
<p>would have to leave Basra Palace once it was known that the UK military would be </p>
<p>moving out.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Officials reported in December 2006 that the rapid withdrawal had raised concerns </p>
<p>among the UK’s partners about its commitment to civilian operations.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The Government did not assess to what extent civilians could be effective in a </p>
<p>highly insecure environment. Nor did the principal government departments concerned </p>
<p>reach agreement on a cross-government framework for managing risk in such </p>
<p>circumstances.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> By late 2006, UK civilian activity in Iraq, particularly in Basra and the South, had </p>
<p>become severely constrained by the security situation. Only after the change in the </p>

<p>operation in March 2008 to drive Shia militias out of Basra, was there a strategic context </p>
<p>in which the effectiveness of UK civilians in the South was no longer determined by the </p>
<p>security threat and the availability of protective measures.</p>
<p><b>Civilian-military co-ordination</b></p>
<p><b>60. </b> In the absence of a cross-government framework for managing risk, there was no </p>
<p>overarching consideration of the security assets needed for civilians to do their jobs </p>
<p>effectively, which UK military assets should be assigned to protect civilians and what </p>
<p>constituted an appropriate level of expenditure on protective security in the particular </p>
<p>circumstances of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Sections 6.4 and 6.5 address the shortcomings in UK civilian–military co-ordination </p>
<p>during pre-invasion planning and preparation for post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Those shortcomings persisted after the invasion.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> On 11 April 2003, shortly before the opening of the British Office Baghdad, officials </p>
<p>advised Mr Straw that no decision had been taken on how to guard the compound </p>
<p>perimeter. The MOD was considering the issue, but would “take some persuasion to </p>
<p>redeploy to Baghdad from the South”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>64. </b> On 15 July 2005, the Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) discussed the first draft of a paper </p>
<p>to be signed by Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, on the planned drawdown of UK </p>
<p>military forces from southern Iraq. The ISG concluded that the draft, which made no </p>
<p>reference to the potential consequences of the drawdown for civilian activities, needed to </p>
<p>cover more clearly the implications for other government departments and international </p>
<p>actors.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> In the revised paper, Dr Reid stated that, although the drawdown was likely to result </p>
<p>in a significant cost saving to the military, other departments operating in Iraq might face </p>
<p>increased security costs as they were “forced to seek commercial alternatives to military </p>
<p>force protection”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> No alternatives were proposed.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> On 30 September 2005, a joint FCO/MOD/DFID paper recommended the </p>
<p>allocation of additional resources to security, including UK military resources. </p>
<p>A No.10 official told Mr Blair that Dr Reid did not support the proposal.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> In October 2005, Dr Reid sought approval to procure a counter-measure to the </p>
<p>threat posed to UK troops by Improvised Explosive Devices.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> Ten days later, Mr Hilary </p>
<p>Benn, the International Development Secretary, expressed support for the proposal, </p>
<p>pointing out that it would also “significantly reduce the current threat against UK forces </p>
<p>and DFID staff”.</p>

<p>15.2  |  Conclusions: Civilian personnel</p>
<p>421</p>
<p><b>Locally engaged staff</b></p>
<p><b>68. </b> LE staff played an essential role in the UK effort in Iraq. They became increasingly </p>
<p>important as security deteriorated and the mobility of UK personnel became constrained.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Officials recognised in 2003 the critical role of LE staff and the personal risk they </p>
<p>took in working for the UK Government. The issue came into sharper focus in Basra </p>
<p>in April 2006, when the British Consul General reported that most LE staff in the city </p>
<p>considered it too dangerous to come into work.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> On 18 June 2006, an LE member of staff at the British Embassy Office Basra was </p>
<p>murdered. His wife, also an LE member of staff, was seriously injured.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> The visibility of LE staff in the local community made them particularly vulnerable </p>
<p>to attack. UK officials in Iraq took steps to manage the risk, including the introduction </p>
<p>of flexible shift patterns. DFID local staff in Basra, who were particularly exposed to the </p>
<p>threat because of the extent of their work outside the Basra Palace site, had standing </p>
<p>permission not to come to work if they felt unsafe.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Only in August 2007, faced with a further deterioration in security and growing press </p>
<p>interest in LE staff, did officials try, with some difficulty, to reconcile FCO, DFID, MOD </p>
<p>and, as the department responsible for immigration, Home Office views to establish “a </p>
<p>coherent cross-Whitehall approach”.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>73. </b> The design and implementation of the Locally Engaged Staff Assistance Scheme, </p>
<p>announced in Parliament in October 2007, was further hindered by shortcomings in the </p>
<p>data on LE staff held by the FCO and the MOD.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> The evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that the UK did not fail in its duty of care to </p>
<p>LE staff, but the Inquiry concludes that the Government should have recognised sooner that </p>
<p>LE staff were uniquely exposed to the security threat and vital to the UK effort in Iraq, and </p>
<p>that this was an issue requiring a co-ordinated and agreed approach across departments.</p>
<p><b>Language skills</b></p>
<p><b>75. </b> Several witnesses to the Inquiry commented on the shortage of Arabic speakers </p>
<p>among civilians deployed to Iraq throughout the period covered by the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> There was also a shortage of Arabic speakers available to support the UK military.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> The deployment of more Arabic speakers would have provided the opportunity to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase UK access to Iraqi institutions and society;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>build greater trust between the UK Government and influential Iraqis; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve UK understanding of political and social undercurrents in Iraq.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>422</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Two main factors appear to have contributed to the failure to meet the demand for </p>
<p>Arabic speakers in Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the finite number of Arabic speakers in the FCO; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of a mechanism for redeploying Arabic speakers from other FCO </p>
<p>jobs at short notice.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The Inquiry welcomes the steps taken by the FCO since 2010 to increase the </p>
<p>number of Arabic speaker positions at FCO posts in the Middle East and North Africa, </p>
<p>and Mr William Hague’s decision as Foreign Secretary to open a new FCO language </p>
<p>school in 2013 and to prioritise Arabic language training.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The Inquiry fully endorses Mr Hague’s view that expertise in a foreign language </p>
<p>makes UK diplomats:</p>
<p>“... vastly more effective at communicating the viewpoint of the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>And it is vital to understanding the political mood in different countries and to </p>
<p>spotting trends or anticipating crises.”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>81. </b> There is little evidence, however, that the Government has considered how to </p>
<p>respond effectively to a sudden surge in demand for particular language skills, especially </p>
<p>where demand may be unforeseen.</p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>82. </b> The Inquiry recognises that, since 2003, significant changes have been made to </p>
<p>the UK’s strategic and operational approach to reconstruction and stabilisation. Some </p>
<p>of those changes, including the establishment of a deployable UK civilian stand-by </p>
<p>capability, are the direct result of lessons learned from serious shortcomings in the </p>
<p>deployment of civilian personnel in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> The lessons identified in this Section remain relevant to the UK’s evolving </p>
<p>approach to reconstruction and stabilisation.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Other lessons relating to the strategic role of civilians in post-conflict reconstruction </p>
<p>and stabilisation operations, the relationship between civilian and military deployments, </p>
<p>and the impact of the UK’s civilian-led programmes in Iraq are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 10.4.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> The effectiveness of the UK civilian effort in post-conflict Iraq was compromised by </p>
<p>a range of factors, including the absence of effective cross-government co-ordination on </p>
<p>risk, duty of care and the terms and conditions applicable to personnel serving in Iraq.</p>

<p>15.2  |  Conclusions: Civilian personnel</p>
<p>423</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The difficult working conditions for civilians in Iraq were reflected in short tour lengths </p>
<p>and frequent leave breaks. Different departments adopted different arrangements </p>
<p>throughout the Iraq campaign, leading to concerns about breaks in continuity, loss of </p>
<p>momentum, lack of institutional memory and insufficient local knowledge.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Different departments will continue to deploy civilian staff in different roles. </p>
<p>Standardisation of all aspects of those deployments may not be appropriate, but greater </p>
<p>harmonisation of departmental policies should be considered wherever possible. </p>
<p>The same approach should be applied to LE staff.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> At all stages, including planning, departments must give full consideration to their </p>
<p>responsibilities and duty of care towards LE staff, who have an essential contribution to </p>
<p>make and will face particular risks in insecure environments.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> All civilian deployments should be assessed and reviewed against a single, </p>
<p>rigorous, cross-government framework for risk management. The framework should </p>
<p>provide the means for the Government as a whole to strike an effective balance between </p>
<p>security and operational effectiveness, and to take timely decisions on the provision of </p>
<p>appropriate security measures.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Standardising tour lengths for civilians deployed by different departments would </p>
<p>have eased the overall administrative burden and, perhaps, some of the tensions </p>
<p>between individuals from different government departments serving in Iraq. But the </p>
<p>environment was difficult and individuals’ resilience and circumstances varied. The </p>
<p>introduction of the option to extend a tour of duty was an appropriate response.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> Throughout any operation of this kind, departments should maintain two </p>
<p>procedures for the systematic debriefing of staff returning to the UK: one to meet duty of </p>
<p>care obligations, the other to learn lessons from their experience.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> It is difficult to separate the issue of the seniority or personal impact of individual </p>
<p>civilians from the wider question of UK influence on the US, which is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> In order to identify individuals with the right skills, there must be clarity about the </p>
<p>roles they are to perform. Wherever possible, individuals should be recruited for and </p>
<p>deployed to clearly defined roles appropriate to their skills and seniority. They must be </p>
<p>provided with the equipment needed to perform those roles to a high standard.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> The Government should consider the introduction of a mechanism for responding </p>
<p>to a surge in demand for a particular language capability.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The Inquiry views the inability of the FCO, the MOD and DFID to confirm how many </p>
<p>civilian personnel were deployed to or employed in Iraq, in which locations and in what </p>
<p>roles, as a serious failure. Data management systems must provide accurate information </p>
<p>on the names, roles and locations of all staff for whom departments have duty of </p>
<p>care responsibilities.</p>
