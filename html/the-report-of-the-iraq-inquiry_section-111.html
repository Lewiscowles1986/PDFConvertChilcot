<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decision to remove some members of the Ba’ath Party from public office </p>
<p>after May 2003, a process known as de&#8209;Ba’athification;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the implementation of that decision; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact it had on Iraq. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pre&#8209;invasion analysis of, and planning for, de&#8209;Ba’athification, which is addressed </p>
<p>in Sections 6.4 and 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decision to disband the Iraqi Army, which is described in Section 12.1; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the creation of the Coalition Provisional Authority, which is covered in </p>
<p>Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can be </p>
<p>read in Section 11.2.</p>
<p><b>The Ba’ath Party</b></p>
<p>The Arab Socialist Party or Ba’ath Party was founded in Damascus in 1947 by </p>
<p>Michael Aflaq and Salah al&#8209;Din al&#8209;Bitar.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Its core objective was the creation of a single, </p>
<p>united Arab State. </p>
<p>Having established itself in Syria, the Ba’ath Party then spread to other Arab countries. </p>
<p>The Iraqi Ba’ath Party was formally established in 1952. </p>
<p>The Ba’ath Party took power in Syria through a coup in 1963, where it was enshrined </p>
<p>in the Constitution as “the leading party of society and state”. The party seized power </p>
<p>in Iraq after a revolution in the same year but was manoeuvred out by the military a few </p>
<p>months later. </p>
<p>The Ba’ath Party returned to power in Iraq in 1968 in a coup led by Ahmad Hasan al&#8209;Bakr, </p>
<p>supported by Saddam Hussein. Ba’ath members and party organisations were imposed </p>
<p>on the Iraqi military shortly after. </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein succeeded President al&#8209;Bakr in 1979, after which point the party was </p>
<p>increasingly dominated by individuals linked to him by family or tribal ties.</p>
<p>An ideological split in 1966 led to the Syrian and Iraqi parties becoming estranged and </p>
<p>bitterly antagonistic toward each other. The Syrian Ba’ath Party maintained a focus on </p>
<p>Arab unity while Iraqi Ba’athists focused on Iraqi nationalism. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>11.1  |  De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In early 2002, the Defence Intelligence Staff estimated Ba’ath Party membership within </p>
<p>Iraq at between 600,000 and 700,000 individuals, which represented 4 percent of the </p>
<p>population. There were several tiers of membership, reflecting individual members’ roles </p>
<p>within the party hierarchy. Membership was essential to reach senior positions in the </p>
<p>military, the government or in professional life. </p>
<p><b>The development of de-Ba’athification policy</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> As described in Section 6.5, although it was widely assumed that a process for </p>
<p>removing senior members of the Ba’ath Party from positions of power would be required </p>
<p>after the invasion, no clear plan for the de&#8209;Ba’athification of Iraq’s public sector had been </p>
<p>agreed between the US and UK at the point the invasion was launched.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>5. </b> Because of the extent to which the Ba’ath Party was intertwined with Iraq’s </p>
<p>bureaucracy, the failure of the US and UK to agree an approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>compounded uncertainty about how the bureaucracy might perform after Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s departure.</p>
<p><b>Post-invasion</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> As Coalition Forces entered Iraq in March 2003, Ministers were supplied with a </p>
<p>‘script’ to use in media and Parliamentary discussion which set out the UK vision for </p>
<p>“Phase IV”, the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> The script said:</p>
<p>“When conditions in Iraq permit, the US Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p>
<p>Affairs (ORHA) will move to Baghdad and take on the supervision of the civil </p>
<p>administration of Iraq … We hope that the vast majority of the Iraqi public sector will </p>
<p>remain in place and be able to carry on its work …”</p>
<p><b>7. </b> On 4 April, a Private Secretary to Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, supplied </p>
<p>Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, with six papers </p>
<p>on post&#8209;conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> One covered the Iraqi civil service, and stated:</p>
<p>“We do not have any deep knowledge about which levels of the administration are </p>
<p>so highly politicised as to need immediate reform, nor which individuals might have </p>
<p>to be retired or stood down. This in any case cannot realistically be assessed until </p>
<p>after liberation.”</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The question of what future strength and support the Ba’ath Party would command </p>
<p>within Iraq was raised by Mr Colin Burgon in a House of Commons debate on 7 April.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>9. </b> In reply Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, explained:</p>
<p>“It is a very difficult question to answer at this stage, not least because the only way </p>
<p>of assuring success in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was to be a member of the Ba’ath </p>
<p>party and to operate under his rule. On the other hand, there may well be decent </p>
<p>people who had no part in the excesses of the regime and who will, in turn, return </p>
<p>to rebuild their country. I suspect that it will depend on their ability to persuade </p>
<p>people in their own areas that they have not been involved with the regime and that </p>
<p>they can therefore be relied on and trusted.”</p>
<p><b>10. </b> Mr Hoon’s reply was consistent with a briefing produced on the same date by the </p>
<p>Defence Intelligence Service (DIS) Red Team on Iraq.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> The Red Team judged:</p>
<p>“To be a Ba’athist does not necessarily mean an individual is a hard core supporter </p>
<p>of the regime. Most joined to advance their careers or under duress (mostly </p>
<p>government employees). In every government department there is a hard core who </p>
<p>have been responsible for security. They are responsible for the ‘disappeared’; are </p>
<p>known by everybody and will be nervous. </p>
<p>“It will require detailed inside knowledge to identify the ‘bad apples’ in any </p>
<p>organisation …”</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Similar points were made by Ms Clare Short, the International Development </p>
<p>Secretary, on 10 April.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> In response to a Parliamentary Question from Ms Helen </p>
<p>Southworth, Ms Short said:</p>
<p>“… Iraq is like the former Soviet Union, where people had to join the Communist </p>
<p>party if they wanted to be a teacher. Many members of the Ba’ath Party are not </p>
<p>the real leaders of the regime, and they will need to remain in their jobs so as to </p>
<p>continue to run their country.”</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The first formal public statement by the Coalition about the treatment of the Ba’ath </p>
<p>Party was made when General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief US Central </p>
<p>Command (CENTCOM), issued his Freedom Message to the Iraqi People on 16 April </p>
<p>(see Section 9.1). </p>
<p><b>13. </b> As described in Section 9.1, Mr Huw Llewellyn from FCO Legal Advisers provided </p>
<p>advice to the Iraq Policy Unit (IPU) on the draft text of the Message on 28 March.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> In relation to de&#8209;Ba’athification, Mr Llewellyn was concerned that the practical </p>
<p>effect of disestablishing the Ba’ath Party was not implemented in the Directive to the </p>
<p>Civilian Population that Gen Franks intended to issue in parallel. He also suggested </p>
<p>5 </p>
<p>Briefing DIS Red Team, 7 April 2003, ‘What Will Happen in Baghdad?’</p>

<p>Minute Llewellyn to Chilcott, 28 March 2003, ‘Proposed US “Freedom Message” to the People of Iraq’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>11.1  |  De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>that the word “disestablished” should be replaced with “dissolved” or something with </p>
<p>the same meaning. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Commenting on a subsequent draft of the text on 10 April, Mr Llewellyn explained:</p>
<p>“The paragraph dissolving the Ba’ath party is clearly important. But the word </p>
<p>‘disestablished’ does not really do the trick. That word is something to do with </p>
<p>removing an institution from the structure of the state, as I understand it. We should </p>
<p>say ‘dissolved’.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>16. </b> On 11 April, during a video conference between UK, US and Australian legal </p>
<p>advisers, the US lawyers explained that they saw a need to disestablish the Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>and deprive it of all authority “in order for other things to happen as a result from the </p>
<p>legal and policy point of view”.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>17. </b> On 11 April, Mr Llewellyn circulated a first draft of guidelines for UK personnel, </p>
<p>in particular those seconded to ORHA, on the relevant provisions of International </p>
<p>Humanitarian Law (IHL).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> Under the heading “Removal of Officials”, it stated:</p>
<p>“Officials may be removed, although this should not be done arbitrarily. Clearly, the </p>
<p>Coalition will remove from office those who were members of Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>regime, and senior members of the Ba’ath Party if any remain. Other officials may </p>
<p>be removed where they represent an obstacle to administration by the Coalition, for </p>
<p>example because they pose a threat to security, are corrupt, unwilling to act under </p>
<p>Coalition administration, or will be intimidating for the population.” </p>
<p><b>18. </b> A senior MOD legal adviser to whom the draft guidelines were sent for comment </p>
<p>suggested that the guidelines should be more precise about what was meant by </p>
<p>“members of Saddam Hussein’s regime” and “senior members of the Ba’ath Party”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She asked whether it was likely there would be anyone who would fall into the first </p>
<p>category who did not also fall within the second. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> The Inquiry has not seen evidence that any discussion of the degree to which former </p>
<p>members of the Ba’ath Party might be entitled to participate in the Iraqi Interim Authority </p>
<p>(IIA) took place at the conference held in Nasiriyah on 15 April and attended for the UK </p>
<p>by Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> There is a mention in one of the supporting papers, produced by the FCO’s </p>
<p>Research Analysts, of the need to establish whether members of Iraq’s popular councils </p>
<p>could be used in the selection of members for the IIA given that they had previously </p>

<p>been “approved” by the Ba’ath Party which might mean they were considered to be </p>
<p>“tainted”.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> In his memoir, Mr Douglas Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, </p>
<p>describes re&#8209;writing the first draft of Gen Franks’ message produced by CENTCOM.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Feith’s re&#8209;written version included the reference to the disestablishment of the Ba’ath </p>
<p>Party. His view was that disestablishing the Ba’ath Party was a separate issue from the </p>
<p>fate of individual members, which was still under discussion at the time of Gen Franks’ </p>
<p>statement. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> In a paper for the Pentagon Public Affairs Office on 16 April, Mr Feith’s Office </p>
<p>suggested that the answer to questions about what would happen to members of the </p>
<p>Ba’ath Party should be:</p>
<p>“… its [the Ba’ath Party’s] property and records will be considered by the CPA as the </p>
<p>property of the Iraqi people. Absent exceptional circumstances, top&#8209;tier members </p>
<p>of the Ba’ath Party will not be eligible to hold any positions of responsibility under </p>
<p>the CPA. Lower ranking members of the Ba’ath Party will not necessarily be barred </p>
<p>from such employment. No one will be punished merely for membership in the </p>
<p>Ba’ath Party.”</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Gen Franks’ Freedom Message was issued on 16 April.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“The Arab Socialist Renaissance Party of Iraq (Hiz al&#8209;Ba’ath al&#8209;Arabi al&#8209;Istiraki </p>
<p>al&#8209;Iraqi) is hereby disestablished. Property of the Ba’ath Party should be turned </p>
<p>over to the Coalition Provisional Authority. The records of the Ba’ath Party are an </p>
<p>important part of the records of the Government of Iraq and should be preserved … </p>
<p>and turn[ed] … over to the Coalition Provisional Authority.” </p>
<p><b>24. </b> On 17 April, a discussion between Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy </p>
<p>Adviser, and Dr Condoleezza Rice, US National Security Advisor, suggested that the </p>
<p>announcement about the Ba’ath Party had come as a surprise to her.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that he had discussed the question of de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>with Gen Franks in Kuwait in mid&#8209;April:</p>
<p>“… and he had said to me that his view was you should take anybody apart from </p>
<p>those who were obviously bad into the system, and then vet them subsequently, </p>
<p>and if they – and I remember him saying – if they didn’t pass muster, didn’t pass </p>
<p>the vetting, then you’d kick them out. But what you didn’t do was wholly to degrade </p>
<p>the administration in advance, and I thought, not least because he was the senior </p>

<p>17</p>
<p> He asked the Government to: </p>
<p>“… explain the status of important political groups such as the Ba’ath party, the </p>
<p>Communist party and the Islamic fundamentalists? Will they be allowed to compete </p>
<p>freely and democratically in those elections and if they won would they be allowed </p>
<p>to win?”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> In reply, Mr Mike O’Brien, FCO Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, explained:</p>
<p>“We hope that the Ba’ath Party will not be able to involve itself in that election, and </p>
<p>certainly not in the form that it took under Saddam Hussein. It is not envisaged, </p>
<p>therefore, that it would be allowed to operate.”</p>
<p><b>The CPA approach</b></p>
<p><b>28. </b> The creation of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), led by Ambassador L Paul </p>
<p>Bremer, and the appointment in early May of Mr John Sawers as the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>Special Representative to Iraq are described in Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Ambassador Bremer, in his account of leading the CPA, describes being given his </p>
<p>instructions:</p>
<p>“On May 9, my last day of preparation at the Pentagon, Don Rumsfeld had given me </p>
<p>my marching orders in a memo. Among all my other instructions, Rumsfeld’s memo </p>
<p>emphasized: ‘The Coalition will actively oppose Saddam Hussein’s old enforcers – </p>
<p>the Ba’ath Party, the Fedayeen Saddam … We will make clear that the Coalition will </p>
<p>eliminate the remnants of Saddam’s regime.’”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>30. </b> In his memoir, Mr Feith wrote that Ambassador Bremer “wanted his arrival in </p>
<p>Baghdad to have a theme: The Ba’athists are not coming back.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Mr Feith wrote:</p>
<p>“Bremer had considered his point carefully. Our forces had not yet captured </p>
<p>Saddam, and many Iraqis remained fearful of the Ba’athists – and therefore unwilling </p>
<p>to cooperate with U.S. officials – on security, political reconstruction, and other </p>
<p>matters. Bremer saw it as his first task to offer assurance … I thought Bremer had </p>
<p>selected his “arrival theme” wisely, and I told him so.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Feith recorded that a draft de&#8209;Ba’athification policy had been considered by </p>
<p>the US National Security Council on 10 March. At Ambassador Bremer’s request, </p>
<p>implementation of the policy, which would “rid the Iraqi Government of the small group of </p>
<p>true believers at the top of the party and those who had committed crimes in its name”, </p>
<p>was delayed until his arrival in Iraq.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Ambassador Bremer wrote:</p>
<p>“Our concern was only the top four levels of the party membership, which the [draft] </p>
<p>order officially excluded from public life. These were the Ba’athist loyalists who, </p>
<p>by virtue of their positions of power in the regime, had been active instruments of </p>
<p>Saddam’s repression. Our intelligence community estimated that they amounted </p>
<p>to only about 1 percent of all party members or approximately 20,000 people, </p>
<p>overwhelmingly Sunni Arabs.”</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Four days after arriving in Iraq, Mr Sawers reported that there was a fear among </p>
<p>“ordinary people in Baghdad” that the Ba’athists could return.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> He assessed:</p>
<p>“ORHA have made mistakes here, appointing quite senior party figures as their </p>
<p>main partners in the trade and health ministries, at Baghdad University and so on. </p>
<p>Several political leaders I have seen say a line should be drawn at the ‘firqa’ level of </p>
<p>the Ba’ath Party and all those at that level and the three above should be excluded, </p>
<p>about 30,000 in all. This would represent between five and ten per cent of total party </p>
<p>membership. But it is still a lot of people and may be one level too many, at least </p>
<p>for now.”</p>
<p><b>34. </b> In one of his earliest reports to London, on 12 May Mr Sawers reported that </p>
<p>Dr Ahmed Chalabi’s “strong message on de&#8209;Ba’athification strikes a chord” with the </p>
<p>Shia population “and will become even more potent if we don’t deal with re&#8209;emerging </p>
<p>Ba’athists”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Dr Chalabi was a founding member of the Iraqi National Congress Party </p>
<p>who had formed strong links with several US Administrations.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> After his first meeting with Ambassador Bremer, Mr Sawers reported: “Bremer, rightly, </p>
<p>plans to move quickly to set out a policy on ‘de&#8209;Ba’athification’ or ‘De&#8209;Saddam&#8209;isation’ as </p>
<p>it may now be called.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>36. </b> Mr Sawers judged:</p>
<p>“… the issue needs addressing quickly. The question is how to define the scope </p>
<p>of those excluded. All agree that the top three levels of the Ba’ath … should be </p>
<p>banned. Our rough estimate suggests that should cover up to 5,000 people. Added </p>

<p>to that will have to be the top levels of the instruments of repression – the security, </p>
<p>intelligence organisations etc. </p>
<p>“Some politicians … are arguing that the fourth level of the party … should also </p>
<p>be included. This would extend the numbers to some 30,000 possibly more. The </p>
<p>argument in favour is that this is the level where party officials began to receive </p>
<p>privileges such as free housing and thus were identified popularly as beneficiaries </p>
<p>of the regime. Against that is the danger that too wide a list will be hard to </p>
<p>administer; that we should not exclude too large a group from the new system; </p>
<p>and it would increase the risk of false accusations against innocent people …</p>
<p>“Grateful for early views on this issue. My own instinct is we should not throw the net </p>
<p>wider than necessary, and that for now we could settle on the top three tiers … But </p>
<p>I frankly don’t have sufficient feel for the Iraqi Ba’ath Party to know the level at which </p>
<p>real evil began.”</p>
<p><b>37. </b> The following day, Mr Sawers reported that Ambassador Bremer’s staff in the CPA </p>
<p>had a “similar [approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification] to ours, and they share our uncertainty </p>
<p>over how wide to cast the net”.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> In particular, “banning all party members from any of </p>
<p>the top three tiers in ministries” could inadvertently exclude “many of the technocrats we </p>
<p>will want to re&#8209;employ”. Ambassador Bremer had explained that the steer he was getting </p>
<p>from Mr Donald Rumsfeld, US Defense Secretary, and President Bush was to “spread </p>
<p>the net widely initially, and then to allow exceptions without too many obstacles”. </p>
<p><b>38. </b> On 13 May, Sir David Manning met Dr Rice and other National Security Council </p>

<p>25</p>
<p> A report of the meeting by Mr Rycroft said that Sir David had </p>
<p>gone through the points raised by Mr Sawers on de&#8209;Ba’athification, and the NSC team </p>
<p>had agreed with them. They told Sir David that the US had agreed a de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>strategy the previous week. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> The following day, the FCO in London sent Mr Sawers the instructions he had </p>
<p>requested.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> The FCO wrote:</p>
<p>“… there should be a [de&#8209;Ba’athification] process, but its scope should be limited, </p>
<p>and there needs to be room for discretion. </p>
<p>“We agree that the net should not be cast too wide. Excluding the top three ranks </p>
<p>from public service … is probably the most practical approach … In certain cases, </p>
<p>particularly in the security services, Ba’ath members may have to be moved aside </p>
<p>in order to provide … reassurance, whatever their position in the party. But we do </p>
<p>not want to create a large underground of disaffected Ba’athists who see no possible </p>
<p>future for themselves in post&#8209;Saddam Iraq … So the short answer to the question </p>

<p>about the fourth level of the Ba’ath is that there will be a vetting process … to ensure </p>
<p>no rotten apples are kept on … One of the leading academic Iraq&#8209;watchers, Toby </p>
<p>Dodge, has remarked to us that membership of the Ba’ath was less significant </p>
<p>latterly than less formal networks of control and influence. There is a danger, in </p>
<p>focusing on the Ba’ath, of overlooking potentially more malign elements.”</p>
<p><b>40. </b> The message from the FCO also re&#8209;stated the legal position that Occupying Powers </p>
<p>could remove public officials from their posts but that “for both policy and legal reasons, </p>
<p>we should stick to what is necessary”. Occupying Powers could not “regulate or prohibit </p>
<p>political expression or activity except to the extent that is necessary on grounds of </p>
<p>security or public order”. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> The message ended:</p>
<p>“The longer&#8209;term process of de&#8209;Ba’athification is for a future government of Iraq </p>

<p><b>42. </b> On 13 May, Mr Walt Slocombe, CPA Senior Adviser on National Security and </p>
<p>Defense, met Mr Hoon in London.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> In his record of the meeting, Mr Hoon’s Assistant </p>
<p>Private Secretary wrote that Mr Slocombe had said “a visible and functioning police </p>
<p>force … might require some compromise on de&#8209;Ba’athification”. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> Mr Simon Webb, MOD Policy Director, was also present at Mr Hoon’s meeting with </p>
<p>Mr Slocombe. Mr Webb told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We had certainly accepted … the need for de&#8209;Ba’athification … So we had bought </p>
<p>that by that stage … I don’t recall having a specific conversation about how far that </p>
<p>was going to go. But … I think we were probably content for this to be decided by </p>
<p>those in Baghdad. If the policy is partial de&#8209;Ba’athification, and everybody seems </p>
<p>to understand the issues … I wouldn’t have tried to press a particular level in the </p>
<p>command structure on Walt. … There was a judgement which you couldn’t really </p>
<p>make until you got on the ground about what level you went down to … at some </p>
<p>stage, you hit the school teacher who just joined the party because they wanted </p>
<p>a job. But where in that spectrum you cut it off, recognising that you, implicitly </p>
<p>at least … wanted to remove the possibility of an early reassertion of power by </p>
<p>Ba’ath Party …”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Ambassador Bremer told the Inquiry that “Slocombe reported that the British officials </p>

<p>11.1  |  De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>45. </b> On 14 May, Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, </p>
<p>was shown a draft diplomatic cable setting out Washington’s guidance to Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer on the implementation of the de&#8209;Ba’athification policy.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Brenton reported to the FCO that the cable proposed that full Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>members (group, section and branch members) would be banned from public office, </p>
<p>including teaching positions. They would also be interviewed and an evaluation made </p>
<p>of whether they may have committed criminal acts or continued to pose a risk to the </p>
<p>security of the Coalition.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> To implement this, all individuals in the top three layers of management in each </p>
<p>government Ministry would be evaluated to establish the extent of their Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>involvement. Those proven to be members would be removed. For junior employees </p>
<p>below the top three layers, evaluation would not be automatic but the discovery of any </p>
<p>“adverse information” would lead to their investigation.</p>
<p><b>48. </b> The Annotated Agenda prepared by the Cabinet Office for a meeting of the Ad Hoc </p>
<p>Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation (AHMGIR) the following day asked Ministers to:</p>
<p>“… agree that we press in principle for the removal from public service and politics </p>
<p>[of] only the top three tiers of the Ba’ath Party.”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>49. </b> The Annotated Agenda stated that extending the ban to the fourth tier of the Ba’ath </p>
<p>Party (and so to 30,000 people) would be “excessive and detrimental to public service </p>
<p>provision”. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> At the meeting of the AHMGIR on 15 May, Mr Straw stated that the Coalition should </p>
<p>be “flexible” in its approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification, “for example excluding many who </p>
<p>had been part of Saddam Hussein’s security apparatus, but fewer from more technical </p>
<p>positions”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>51. </b> The Group amended the objective proposed by officials to:</p>
<p>“… press for the removal from public service and politics of those members of the </p>
<p>Ba’ath Party judged to have played a malign role.”</p>
<p><b>52. </b> On 15 May, Mr Sawers reported that the de&#8209;Ba’athification policy had been agreed </p>
<p>along the lines reported earlier by Mr Brenton.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>53. </b> On the question of whether the bar should extend to the fourth level of party </p>
<p>membership, Mr Sawers reported that he had “warned of the danger of overkill” but, like </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>Ambassador Bremer, had been persuaded by those arguing that “the recommended </p>
<p>policy of covering all four levels was pitched right”. Mr Sawers commented:</p>
<p>“This new policy is tougher than your advice preferred … But I advise against any </p>
<p>action in Washington. The new policy is badly needed, and it corresponds with the </p>
<p>preferences of all the members of the Leadership Group bar Allawi.”</p>
<p><b>54. </b> On the same day, Mr Llewellyn provided advice to IPU on a draft Order removing </p>
<p>the Ba’ath Party leadership.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> It is clear from his comments that this was the final draft </p>
<p>of what became CPA Order No.1 and he noted that it was probably on the point of being </p>
<p>issued. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> In Mr Llewellyn’s view, the main question was whether the UK was satisfied </p>
<p>that displaying images or likenesses of Saddam Hussein (or other readily identifiable </p>
<p>members of the former regime or symbols of the Ba’ath Party) was of sufficient concern </p>
<p>that it necessitated prohibition on the grounds of security and/or public order, the only </p>
<p>grounds that would be permitted under international humanitarian law. </p>
<p><b>CPA Order No.1</b></p>
<p><b>56. </b> CPA Order No.1, “De&#8209;Ba’athification of Iraqi Society”, was issued on 16 May 2003.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was Ambassador Bremer’s first formal act as head of the CPA. </p>
<p><b>57. </b> The Order stated that it was implementing General Franks’ disestablishment of the </p>
<p>Ba’ath Party in his 16 April message: </p>
<p>“… by eliminating the party’s structures and removing its leadership from positions </p>
<p>of authority and responsibility in Iraqi society. By this means, the Coalition </p>
<p>Provisional Authority will ensure that representative government in Iraq is not </p>
<p>threatened by Ba’athist elements returning to power and that those in positions </p>
<p>of authority in the future are acceptable to the people of Iraq.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>58. </b> The Order stated that disestablishment was to be achieved by removing “full” </p>
<p>members of the Ba’ath party (defined as the top four ranks of party membership)</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>from public sector jobs and banning them from future employment in the public sector.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Individuals holding senior management positions (the top three layers of </p>
<p>management) in all public sector organisations would be interviewed and assessed </p>
<p>for their possible affiliation with the Ba’ath Party, criminal conduct and risk to security. </p>
<p>Any who were found to be full members of the Ba’ath Party would be removed from </p>
<p>employment.</p>

<p>13</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Ambassador Bremer wrote in his account of leading the CPA that he had recognised </p>
<p>from the outset that the de&#8209;Ba’athification Order “wasn’t perfect, but contained a degree </p>
<p>of flexibility” in the provision that allowed for exemptions to the ban to be made on a </p>
<p>case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> Both he and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, a US State Department </p>
<p>official seconded to the CPA, had agreed that this flexibility was “critical”. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> Ambassador Bremer told the Inquiry that the Order was “narrowly drawn” so as to </p>
<p>affect only the top 1 percent of party members, and to deny them public sector positions </p>
<p>but not the ability to work in the private sector.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>62. </b> On the same day that Order No.1 was issued, Mr Blair and President Bush spoke </p>
<p>on the telephone.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> The record of their conversation, taken by Mr Blair’s Assistant Private </p>
<p>Secretary, indicates that they did not discuss de&#8209;Ba’athification. </p>
<p><b>The UK role in relation to Order No.1</b></p>
<p><i>Hard Lessons</i>,<i> </i>an account of the US reconstruction experience in Iraq,<i> </i>characterised </p>
<p>Order No.1 as “conceived in Washington and promulgated with little Iraqi involvement”.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld, in his memoir, observed:</p>
<p>“Though the policy later found few defenders at the top level of the administration, </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification initially had broad support among the relevant departments and </p>
<p>agencies.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>The policy was discussed by the NSC two weeks before the invasion and there were </p>
<p>“no objections from any of the principals present” although President Bush had questioned </p>
<p>who would carry out the vetting needed.</p>
<p>Sir Suma Chakrabarti, DFID Permanent Secretary from 2002 to 2007, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that the de&#8209;Ba’athification decision was one of a number on which his department had </p>
<p>not been consulted.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Lord Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary from 2002 to 2006, described the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification decision as one example of “difficulties in relation to the United States”.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“You know, there’s a lot of debate about de&#8209;Ba’athification and so on … but he </p>
<p>[Bremer] was someone who knew his own mind, but I have to say I did not get the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Mr Sawers reported just before the Order was issued that it was being finalised by the </p>
<p>Department of Defense in Washington and that Ambassador Bremer had been given </p>
<p>guidance on de&#8209;Ba’athification by both Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Sawers told the Inquiry that he did not think that his views were entirely ignored, and </p>
<p>cited examples of where he believed he had been able to influence Ambassador Bremer’s </p>
<p>thinking.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> He made a similar point in May 2003, when he reported that Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer was keen to work with him:</p>
<p>“… in public and private, and has picked up on many UK suggestions, big and small. </p>
<p>He allowed us to re&#8209;balance the decree on removing the Ba’athists, over&#8209;ruling the </p>
<p>wilder strictures of Wolfowitz and Feith in the process.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>Implementation of de-Ba’athification policy</b></p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Sawers reported on 17 May that the members of the Iraqi Leadership Group</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“widely supported” the de&#8209;Ba’athification process and that:</p>
<p>“… all the leaders welcomed the clarity and toughness of the proclamation … </p>
<p>I recalled the exchanges I had had with each of the Group on the issue, and </p>
<p>told them their views had been taken into account in the detailed terms of the </p>
<p>final decree – a good example of co&#8209;operation and consultation with the political </p>
<p>groupings.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>64. </b> A few days later, Mr Sawers reported that de&#8209;Ba’athification had “gone down well”.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He judged that, before the policy, many Iraqis believed there was still a chance the </p>
<p>Ba’athists might return, which “in turn contributed to the security problem”. The policy </p>
<p>was “a huge hit with the political parties we are working with” and, although there would </p>
<p>need to be some exemptions, “Bremer will keep these to a minimum”. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> A few days after Order No.1 was issued, Sir David Manning met Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer in Baghdad.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> In discussion, they observed:</p>
<p>“De&#8209;Ba’athification and the dissolution of security ministries would create a new </p>
<p>reservoir of angry men. So there was a need to step up patrols and tighten up </p>
<p>security.”</p>

<p>15</p>
<p><b>66. </b> On 22 May the AHMGIR met, chaired by Mr Straw.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>67. </b> Briefing for the discussion stated that, although the eventual policy was more </p>
<p>wide&#8209;ranging than the UK had advocated, in practice Ambassador Bremer expected </p>
<p>to “allow those judged ‘clean’ to be re&#8209;employed”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> The Cabinet Office author of the </p>
<p>briefing wrote that the Order would mean that 33,000 people would be banned from </p>
<p>public office in Iraq, and observed:</p>
<p>“… this is more wide&#8209;ranging than the senior level only policy (covering 5,000) </p>
<p>officials we had advocated, and risks removing many essential but less culpable </p>
<p>technocrats from their jobs.” </p>
<p><b>68. </b> The AHMGIR concluded that the UK should “encourage the US to implement its </p>
<p>policy on de&#8209;Ba’athification pragmatically to avoid needlessly removing less culpable </p>
<p>technocrats from key positions”.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><b>69. </b> In a paper for Mr Blair dated 22 May, Major General Tim Cross, the most senior </p>
<p>UK secondee to ORHA, the organisation which pre&#8209;dated the CPA, referred to </p>
<p>the recent de&#8209;Ba’athification announcement as having “created some inevitable </p>
<p>difficulties”, and counselled pragmatic application of the exemptions for “individuals </p>
<p>who are engaged in crucial reconstruction areas, such as power generation/distribution, </p>
<p>water/sanitation etc”.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>70. </b> On 27 May, Mr Sawers reported that a new Iraqi de&#8209;Ba’athification Council was </p>
<p>“designed to give Iraqis a role in the de&#8209;Ba’athification process, and advise Bremer </p>
<p>on how to apply it in specific cases”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> The Council was to be made up of 20 Iraqis, </p>
<p>appointed by the Coalition. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> Ambassador Bremer, in his account of leading the CPA,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>described the Council as an </p>
<p>attempt “to engage responsible Iraqis from the start in the de&#8209;Ba’athification process … </p>
<p>to be sure we were focused on the right people” since the Coalition did not “know Iraq as </p>
<p>well as the Iraqis themselves”.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>72. </b> On 29 May, Mr Blair met Ambassador Bremer in Basra.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>raised the need for more qualified staff in the CPA as a result of de&#8209;Ba’athification. </p>
<p>The record indicates that Mr Blair urged Ambassador Bremer to draw up a list of the </p>
<p>staff he required and not to hesitate to ask for additional staff, which he described as </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>73. </b> In a telegram to the British Embassy Washington on 30 May, FCO officials wrote:</p>
<p>“De&#8209;Ba’athification and dismantling the institutions of the Ba’athist State are clearly </p>
<p>necessary if we are to achieve our post&#8209;conflict objectives. But so too is maintaining </p>
<p>security. We are concerned that some aspects of the first, especially if it includes </p>
<p>laying off without pay the regular army, may have an unnecessarily negative impact </p>
<p>on the second, rather than the positive effects we need them to have.”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>74. </b> The telegram continued:</p>
<p>“We understand why Bremer has felt it necessary to take a tough line on </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification …</p>
<p>“But there is a downside … we are concerned that de&#8209;Ba’athification may be proving </p>
<p>to be a blunt instrument. Our secondees working alongside the ministries are </p>
<p>reporting that the de&#8209;Ba’athification Order is catching Iraqi public servants who have </p>
<p>shown themselves to be effective and willing to work with us in areas critical to the </p>
<p>Coalition’s success – the police, for example.”</p>
<p><b>75. </b> The FCO suggested that the problem should be addressed by the Coalition taking </p>
<p>“a vigorously pragmatic approach to implementing the de&#8209;Ba’athification Order” so that </p>
<p>it provided an incentive to those who were not committed to Ba’athist ideology to work </p>
<p>with the Coalition, for example allowing ex&#8209;party members to be re&#8209;employed on a </p>
<p>probationary basis. The FCO noted that work was “in hand” to develop the machinery </p>
<p>to implement the order.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The following day Sir David Manning reported to Mr Straw’s Principal Private </p>
<p>Secretary that he had told Dr Rice and Mr Andy Card, President Bush’s Chief of Staff, </p>
<p>over dinner that:</p>
<p>“… we had worries about the de&#8209;Ba’athification process. I was sure that it was </p>
<p>right to signal that we were determined to break the Ba’ath Party and dismantle its </p>
<p>structures. But we must be careful not to create a situation in which token Ba’athists </p>
<p>were alienated from the Coalition because we denied them jobs, and a chance to </p>
<p>contribute to post&#8209;Saddam Iraq. If we made this mistake, we would create a large </p>
<p>number of disaffected and hostile people who would quickly turn against us. The key </p>
<p>was surely to be pragmatic. Now that Bremer had made his strong and necessary </p>
<p>commitment to de&#8209;Ba’athification, we should implement it pragmatically. We should </p>
<p>think about operating a system whereby people stayed in their jobs until it was </p>
<p>shown that their track record rather than a Ba’athist label made them a liability.”</p>

<p>11.1  |  De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>77. </b> On 2 June, Mr Blair met President Bush over breakfast.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> In his note reporting their </p>
<p>discussion Sir David recorded Mr Blair’s analysis that the Coalition should be careful not </p>
<p>to create a large pool of disaffected people by targeting those who had joined the Ba’ath </p>
<p>Party simply to get a job.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Blair argued that a clear political vision and timetable was needed, together with </p>
<p>a media strategy to avoid a “dangerous” information vacuum. </p>
<p><b>The Impact of Order No.1</b></p>
<p>Writing in September 2003, Major General Freddie Viggers, the outgoing Senior British </p>
<p>Military Representative &#8209; Iraq, commented in his post&#8209;tour report that “all but the hardliners </p>
<p>are grateful that the Ba’athist regime has been removed”.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>The RAND assessment of the Occupation of Iraq records that the initial reaction to the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification order was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> The authors cite polls in August 2003 reporting </p>
<p>over 94 percent of the Iraqi population saying that either all or some Ba’athists should be </p>
<p>removed from office</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> and that 92 percent of Iraqis opposed the participation of former </p>
<p>Ba’ath Party members in Iraq’s political institutions.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>According to Mr Ali A Allawi, a Minister in both the Interim Iraqi Government and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Transitional Government:</p>
<p>“De&#8209;Ba’athification in the early days of the CPA proceeded in a generally </p>
<p>straightforward way. The vast majority of individuals caught in the round of dismissals </p>
<p>were those who could be clearly identified in the higher levels of the Party ranks, and </p>
<p>the case against them was clear cut.”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><i>Hard Lessons</i> commented:</p>
<p>“Most Iraqis agreed that some de&#8209;Ba’athification was necessary, but many believed </p>
<p>that the CPA order had gone too far …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Whatever its reach should have been, the consequences of the de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>order quickly became clear: it reduced the ranks of Iraq’s capable bureaucrats and </p>
<p>thus limited the capacity of Iraqi ministries to contribute to reconstruction.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Although it recognised the significance of the impact of de&#8209;Ba’athification on the public </p>
<p>sector in Iraq, the RAND report <i>Occupying Iraq</i> observed that the number of individuals </p>
<p>who left office in the first three months of Occupation (10,000) was still less than the </p>
<p>number of senior jobs normally vacated following a change of US Administration.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>General the Lord Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff from May 2003 to April 2006, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that the removal of “a complete layer of administrative competence” was “not … a </p>
<p>particular help”.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Mr Stephen Pattison, FCO Head of the UN Department until June 2003, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we should have realised that without those officials we were going to struggle </p>
<p>really hard to get this country going again and we should have reached out to those </p>
<p>officials in order to bring them back in by offering them assurances about their </p>
<p>pensions or their security or their jobs or whatever.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ms Emma Sky, Governorate Co&#8209;ordinator for Kirkuk province in 2003, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that Major General Raymond Odierno (the US military commander responsible for the </p>
<p>province) had given an amnesty to teachers and doctors on his own authority as a way </p>
<p>of circumventing the Order.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Mr Andy Bearpark, the CPA’s Director of Operations, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… when I observed the effects of the [de&#8209;Ba’athification] policy, I don’t believe that </p>
<p>some of the effects of the policy were quite as severe as some of the critics of the </p>
<p>policy point out, but that’s a belief or assertion on my part. I have no evidence to </p>
<p>support it.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>In Mr Bearpark’s opinion, the issues that he encountered within the senior levels of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Civil Service had more to do with personal rivalry than real concerns about Ba’athist </p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>Mr Chaplin and Mr Asquith, who both served as British Ambassador to Iraq, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that there was a sense of exclusion within the Sunni community as a result of </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification, because they felt that it affected their community disproportionately.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Jonathan Powell told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… it was a mistake to go so far with de&#8209;Ba’athification. It is a similar mistake the </p>
<p>Americans made after the Second World War with de&#8209;Nazification and they had to </p>
<p>reverse it. Once it became clear to us, we argued with the administration to reverse </p>
<p>it, and they did reverse it, although with difficulty because the Shia politicians in the </p>
<p>government were very reluctant to allow it to be reversed, and at the time we were </p>
<p>being criticised for not doing enough de&#8209;Ba’athification.”</p>

<p>19</p>
<p><b>CPA Memorandum No.1</b></p>
<p><b>79. </b> On 3 June, Ambassador Bremer signed CPA Memorandum No.1, which described </p>
<p>the implementation of Order No.1 (de&#8209;Ba’athification) and Order No.5 (creation of the </p>
<p>Iraqi de&#8209;Ba’athification Council).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>80. </b> The Memorandum described an interim process for identifying Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>members using Coalition military investigators. It said:</p>
<p>“As the Administrator determines that the responsibility for identifying Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>members effectively can be transferred to Iraqi citizens, the Administrator shall direct </p>
<p>the Iraqi de&#8209;Ba’athification Council to assume an increasingly significant role in </p>
<p>carrying out the de&#8209;Ba’athification process. </p>
<p>“Initially, the Council will advise the Coalition on de&#8209;Ba’athification policies and </p>
<p>procedures …”</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The Memorandum also established Accreditation Review Committees, to hear </p>
<p>appeals and requests for exemption. Relevant factors for consideration would be:</p>
<p>“… whether the individual:</p>
<p>i. </p>
<p>Is willing to denounce the Ba’ath Party and his past association with it;</p>
<p>ii. </p>
<p>Was a senior Ba’ath Party member or simply a ‘full’ party member;</p>
<p>iii. </p>
<p>Has exceptional educational qualifications;</p>
<p>iv. </p>
<p>Left the Ba’ath Party before April 16, 2003;</p>
<p>v. </p>
<p>Continues to command the support of his colleagues and respect of their </p>
<p>subordinates;</p>
<p>vi. </p>
<p>Is judged to be indispensible to achieving important Coalition interests; at least </p>
<p>in the immediate term;</p>
<p>vii.  Can demonstrate that he joined the party to hold his job or support his family.” </p>
<p><b>82. </b> In early June, Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, reported that he </p>
<p>had observed in a recent visit to Iraq that the implementation of the de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>policy was posing difficulties for UK personnel in the South but that “General Wall seems </p>
<p>to think that he can work quietly to achieve the flexibility he needs without taking US </p>
<p>policy head on.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed de&#8209;Ba’athification briefly when they spoke </p>
<p>by telephone on 6 June.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> Mr Blair argued that the principle was right, but needed </p>
<p>to be applied flexibly: “we should neither undermine public services by sacking key </p>
<p>technocrats nor allow a class of resentful and desperate ex Ba’athists to build up.” </p>
<p><b>84. </b> In his book <i>State of Denial</i> Mr Bob Woodward described General Jay Garner, </p>
<p>the former Head of ORHA, telling Secretary Rumsfeld in June 2003 that the extent </p>
<p>of de&#8209;Ba’athification had been one of three “terrible mistakes” made in Iraq.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> In </p>
<p>Gen Garner’s view, those mistakes were still reversible. Secretary Rumsfeld is reported </p>
<p>to have responded: “We’re not going to go back.” Gen Garner did not make the same </p>
<p>point in person to President Bush.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> One of the UK’s priorities for the first 30 days of the CPA, produced by the IPU and </p>
<p>circulated by Mr Straw on 5 June, was the need for: </p>
<p>“… a pragmatic approach to dismantling the Ba’ath Party and the security apparatus. </p>
<p>We need to destroy the system, not the people. Need to give people reasons to work </p>
<p>with us, not against us: the prospect of work, of a basic income, the chance to find a </p>
<p>place in the new Iraq.”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>86. </b> Discussion at a meeting chaired by Mr Blair on 6 June (see Section 9.2) suggested </p>
<p>that this was not being achieved.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> In both Baghdad and Basra de&#8209;Ba’athification was </p>
<p>listed as one factor in security problems. </p>
<p><b>87. </b> On 9 June, Sir David Manning reported to Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary </p>
<p>that he had told Dr Rice that: </p>
<p>“… she should look again at the de&#8209;Ba’athification programme. The draconian way in </p>
<p>which it was being applied risked acting as a recruiting sergeant for the opposition. It </p>
<p>had been right to take a tough line on the Ba’ath party; but it would be sensible now </p>
<p>to impose it flexibly. We should adopt the approach that those who were not against </p>
<p>us, were with us; rather than act as though we thought those who were not obviously </p>
<p>with us were against us.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>88. </b> On 17 June, instructions from the IPU to Mr Sawers reflected a mounting concern </p>
<p>about the extent of UK influence on decision&#8209;making generally within the CPA.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> The  </p>
<p>IPU wrote:</p>

<p>ensure that we have a say when you are not in town.”</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Following a message from Baghdad reporting progress against the IPU’s list of </p>

<p>need to keep plugging away that it is the system, not the people forced to live in it, </p>
<p>that we want to destroy.”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>90. </b> On 24 June, Baroness Amos, the International Development Secretary, was asked </p>
<p>about the policy of de&#8209;Ba’athification in the House of Lords.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> Lord Wright asked whether </p>
<p>it was true that the:</p>
<p>“… apparent decision to exclude all former members of the Iraqi Ba’ath party, </p>
<p>however junior, from working is not only causing unemployment to a very serious </p>
<p>extent in Iraq but is excluding from the reconstruction process a number of highly </p>
<p>qualified people who would be very ready to undertake those tasks?” </p>
<p><b>91. </b> Baroness Amos replied:</p>
<p>“… the de&#8209;Ba’athification process is under constant discussion. No decisions have </p>
<p>yet been taken. There was a concern that the first three levels should perhaps be </p>
<p>excluded. The implications of that in terms of the administration in Iraq is being </p>
<p>looked at. What we want to see is Iraqis working to reconstruct the country.” </p>
<p><b>92. </b> On 25 June, in a telephone conversation with Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary </p>
<p>of State, Mr Straw said that “de&#8209;Ba’athification had gone too far” and the UK was </p>

<p>86</p>
<p> He suggested that if the same approach had been taken in Germany </p>

<p><b>93. </b> Baroness Amos raised de&#8209;Ba’athification when she met Ambassador Bremer at the </p>
<p>end of June (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> A note of the meeting by her Private Secretary recorded </p>
<p>that Baroness Amos had told Ambassador Bremer that she had:</p>
<p>“… heard some say that this [the de&#8209;Ba’athification process] was biting too deep in </p>
<p>Ministries where large numbers of more senior public servants … might have been </p>
<p>in the top 3 percent of the Ba’ath party, and so removed from post.”</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>94. </b> Mr Sawers’ telegram reporting his impressions of the visit said that Baroness Amos </p>
<p>had told Ambassador Bremer that “the Iraqi women she had met all had horrific stories </p>
<p>of family losses, and had mentioned to her the importance of the [de&#8209;Ba’athification] </p>
<p>policy”.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>95. </b> Both accounts record Ambassador Bremer’s explanation that the policy was:</p>
<p>“… the most popular decision the Coalition had taken. It had not cut deeply into </p>
<p>ministries … it only applied in effect to Directors General. Virtually all the DGs for </p>
<p>Administration had been given exemptions as they were necessary to administer </p>
<p>public sector pay. There had been others where it was essential to the ministry </p>
<p>and there was an important coalition interest. Bremer felt that the main problem </p>
<p>was that lower level members of the Baath party feared that the policy embraced </p>
<p>them too and that they would be unable to return to public sector jobs. This was not </p>
<p>the case …”</p>

<p>Jones asked Mr Hilary Benn, Minister for International Development:</p>
<p>“What action is being taken to distinguish between those Ba’athists who are loyal to </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and those who joined the Ba’ath party only from expediency, who </p>
<p>do not have a record of corruption and abuse and can, therefore, contribute to the </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq?”</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Mr Benn replied:</p>
<p>“It is vital that those who played a leading role in the old regime, and all that </p>
<p>flowed from that, should be removed from their positions but, at the same time, the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification policy should be sensibly applied because we need to ensure that </p>
<p>services can continue to function. The CPA is extremely conscious of the position </p>
<p>and needs to reflect on it as it takes the process forward.”</p>

<p>93</p>
<p><b>101. </b> The CPA and GC had agreed the authorities of the Governing Council, which </p>
<p>described its initial powers.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> They enabled the GC to make policy in all areas, including </p>
<p>on de&#8209;Ba’athification. </p>
<p><b>102. </b> At the end of July, a junior UK official working in Baghdad reported to the FCO on </p>
<p>plans to put an accelerated vetting process in place for the first set of senior appointees </p>
<p>to public positions.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>103. </b> The official wrote that, although substantive work on vetting was to be left until </p>
<p>there was a new Iraqi Government in place, the Coalition had done some preparatory </p>
<p>work. In that initial phase, the intention was that the criteria:</p>
<p>“… will seek to disqualify from key posts only those guilty of crimes against the </p>
<p>Iraqi people. They will be defined with care, taking account of the culture and </p>
<p>methodology of Saddam Hussein’s repressive apparatus. Attention will also be paid </p>
<p>to post&#8209;communist legislation in the three ex&#8209;CEE [Central and Eastern Europe] </p>
<p>countries who have high&#8209;level representatives in the CPA. Their personal views on </p>
<p>the effectiveness of these laws will be listened to.” </p>
<p><b>104. </b> The author of the telegram commented that he had hoped: </p>
<p>“… to have these criteria embodied in a new Order … [to] supplement Order No.1 </p>
<p>on de&#8209;Ba’athification … [which] might also have allayed the concerns of those Iraqis </p>
<p>who doubt whether the CPA is being sufficiently robust with the remnants of the </p>
<p>former regime (there is a fine line between achieving this and disqualifying – and </p>
<p>possibly alienating – those with skills and experience the new Iraq needs).” </p>

<p>96</p>
<p> During that discussion, </p>
<p>Mr Vieira de Mello’s adviser had cautioned that “we should not over emulate post&#8209;war </p>
<p>Germany in the extreme to which we took de&#8209;Ba’athification”. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> According to the authors of the RAND report <i>Occupying Iraq, </i>in August 2003 </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker was raising concerns with Ambassador Bremer about the differing </p>
<p>ways in which the de&#8209;Ba’athification policy was being implemented across Iraq.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> He also </p>
<p>identified that it was affecting more than just hard&#8209;core supporters of Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>and that procedures for making exceptions were slow. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Ambassador Crocker suggested transferring responsibility for the implementation </p>
<p>of de&#8209;Ba’athification to the GC, on the grounds that “an Iraqi body would be more </p>
<p>sensitive to the nuances of the policy”. As a result, on 10 August Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>put a proposal entitled “Proposal for Implementing the Iraqi de&#8209;Ba’athification Council” </p>
<p>to the GC. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> In early September Mr Blair’s Assistant Private Secretary recorded that he believed </p>
<p>“flexible handling of de&#8209;Ba’athification” was needed to avoid excluding potential recruits </p>

<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>110. </b> Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister’s Interim Special Representative on Iraq, </p>

<p>11.1  |  De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>112. </b> In early September, the GC told Ambassador Bremer that it had formed the High </p>
<p>National de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission (DBC), under the chairmanship of Dr Chalabi, </p>
<p>with Mr Nuri al&#8209;Maliki as his deputy.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>113. </b> On 17 September, Dr Chalabi reported to Ambassador Bremer that the </p>
<p>Commission’s first two decisions had been to rescind the exemptions that had previously </p>
<p>been issued to fourth&#8209;tier Ba’athists and to extend the ban on public employment to </p>
<p>include a wider range of public activities, including the media.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> On 18 September, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who had now arrived in Iraq, reported </p>
<p>that the GC’s de&#8209;Ba’athification Council had approved a resolution calling for the </p>
<p>immediate firing of all high&#8209;level Ba’ath Party members from Government service: </p>
<p>“Bremer urged the IGC to co&#8209;ordinate with the Ministry of Education to ensure that </p>
<p>the process of teacher de&#8209;Ba’athification was complete before the schools re&#8209;open </p>
<p>on 1 October. The general issue, which remains controversial, of how to manage </p>
<p>exemptions is one that the IGC will soon have to engage on.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>115. </b> The following day, Sir Jeremy commented:</p>
<p>“I find Bremer’s readiness to push the senior Iraqis to the front very interesting. We </p>
<p>Brits think it the right tactic, but I expected more resistance from him. He continues </p>
<p>to remind the GC eg when they produce ‘decisions’ on … de&#8209;Ba’athification … </p>
<p>that only he can sign things into law. But he does not seem fussed to be losing the </p>
<p>substantive initiative …”</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>116. </b> By 2 October, Sir Jeremy was reporting that the issue of de&#8209;Ba’athification had: </p>
<p>“… not proceeded over the week, despite the mounting concerns of both the </p>
<p>CPA and the GC. The harder&#8209;line end of the GC demanded that senior remaining </p>
<p>Ba’athists should be physically removed from the streets – not just their jobs – and </p>
<p>quickly. Bremer reminded them that the CPA were still worried about due process, </p>
<p>but had yet to receive clarification from the GC on what their recent decision meant. </p>
<p>He asked for decisions on this soon.”</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>117. </b> On 4 November, Ambassador Bremer signed CPA Memorandum No.7.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>118. </b> Memorandum No.7 transferred responsibility for the implementation of </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification to the GC, and enshrined in law the first two decisions of Dr Chalabi’s </p>

<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>119. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported on 6 November that the transfer of responsibility:</p>
<p>“… worried regional commanders in the Sunni Triangle area. They expressed </p>
<p>particular concern about the security implications of another round of dismissals in </p>

<p>from Baghdad that alienated local populations led to his soldiers getting killed.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>120. </b> Having read Sir Jeremy’s message, the IPU’s view was that the decision to hand </p>
<p>full control of de&#8209;Ba’athification to the GC “could result in further instability … we would </p>
<p>wish to see a more pragmatic approach”.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Reporting from Baghdad, Sir Jeremy wrote that he continued to urge a flexible </p>
<p>approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> His messages indicate that Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>agreed with this, though “the IGC wanted tougher de&#8209;Ba’athification”.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> In late November, the head of the Iraqi National Movement, Mr Hatim Mukhlis, </p>
<p>told Sir Jeremy that the de&#8209;Ba’athification policy and disbanding the Iraqi Army had </p>
<p>been mistakes:</p>
<p>“Rather than de&#8209;Ba’athification … Iraq needed a truth and reconciliation committee. </p>
<p>The Ba’ath Party has been a career route for many people. Those who had </p>
<p>committed atrocities or crimes had to be held to account. But many members were </p>
<p>intellectuals and professionals. What was required was time for wounds to heal, but </p>
<p>the opposite was happening, and this was being exacerbated by militia activity. The </p>
<p>CPA could exert pressure on the IGC and influence the de&#8209;Ba’athification process, </p>
<p>which was wrong.”</p>

<p><b>123. </b> According to the RAND report <i>Occupying Iraq</i>, on 9 December Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer:</p>

<p>27</p>
<p><b>124. </b> On 12 December, in a telegram to the FCO on strategy for engaging the Sunni </p>
<p>community, Mr David Richmond, now Deputy Special Representative on Iraq, wrote that </p>
<p>it was essential that:</p>
<p>“The possibility of de&#8209;Ba’athification … distinguish[ed] between senior/criminal </p>
<p>elements and those whose party affiliation was obligatory or nominal. The CPA </p>
<p>almost certainly made a mistake in handing this issue to the IGC. Most IGC </p>
<p>members are hard&#8209;liners more interested in rooting out Ba’athists wherever they </p>
<p>can be found and excluding all former Ba’ath Party members from standing for </p>
<p>elections to the TNA [Transitional National Assembly] than in reconciliation. Not all </p>
<p>Sunnis were Ba’athists but this is bound to cause further alienation. I have spoken </p>
<p>to Bremer about this. He is ready to make clear to the IGC that sweeping exclusions </p>
<p>are unacceptable and that the economic and security consequences have to be </p>
<p>considered”.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>125. </b> In January 2004, the GC published procedures for the implementation of </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> They confirmed that all individuals working in the public sector </p>
<p>who fell into the following categories were to be dismissed immediately if they had not </p>
<p>already been removed from office:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those in the top four tiers of Ba’ath Party membership;</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those in the top three tiers of public sector management qualifying as member </p>
<p>or active member (less senior Ba’athists). </p>
<p><b>126. </b> Those in the top three tiers of Ba’ath Party membership would have no opportunity </p>
<p>for appeal. A formal appeal mechanism was put in place for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those in the fourth tier of Ba’ath Party membership; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those in the top three layers of public sector management who had not been </p>
<p>senior Ba’athists.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Appeals were to be held in two stages; first by local de&#8209;Ba’athification Review </p>
<p>Committees (established by the relevant ministry, in each governorate area) and then </p>
<p>by Dr Chalabi’s Higher National de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission. Appeals could be either </p>
<p>on factual grounds (for example, that the individual had been mistakenly identified as </p>
<p>a senior Ba’ath Party member but had not in fact been one), or on broader grounds </p>
<p>regarding the degree to which the individual subscribed to the ideals of the former </p>
<p>regime. The criteria against which commitment to the regime would be judged were:</p>

<p>having been a prisoner of war in the Iran&#8209;Iraq conflict (there was a presumption </p>
<p>that this group of individuals should retain their employment).</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Appeals to the local de&#8209;Ba’athification Review Committees were to be processed </p>
<p>within six weeks. A panel of two judges, nominated by the Iraqi Council of Judges and </p>
<p>approved by the GC, would sit on Dr Chalabi’s Commission for the purpose of hearing </p>
<p>appeals, and one of these would be required to agree and sign the appeal decision. </p>
<p>Exemptions to the bar on public employment could be granted either for life or for </p>
<p>a one&#8209;year probationary period. A probationary exemption could be revoked if the </p>
<p>individual was found to have fabricated evidence, if new evidence came to light, or </p>

<p><b>132. </b> On 4 February, in response to a question from Mr Llew Smith, Mr O’Brien told the </p>
<p>House of Commons that:</p>
<p>“The process of de&#8209;Ba’athification is an Iraqi led process. Guidelines were </p>
<p>announced by the Iraqi Governing Council on 11 January and provide a clear </p>
<p>framework for this process. The Transitional Administrative Law, which will include </p>
<p>the criteria for nomination to the Transitional National Assembly, is in the final </p>

<p>not have been a member of the dissolved Ba’ath Party at the rank of Division </p>
<p>Member … [the fourth tier of membership] or higher – unless exempted by the </p>
<p>National De Ba’athification Commission – or a member of the past agencies of </p>
<p>repression, or one who participated in the oppression of citizens.”</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>133. </b> The TAL published on 8 March contained the following restrictions on former </p>
<p>members of the Ba’ath Party:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Senior members (fourth tier and above) were not eligible to stand unless they </p>
<p>had been successful in their appeal to the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Full” members would be required to renounce the Ba’ath Party and swear they </p>
<p>had no further dealings or connections with Ba’athist organisations.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>134. </b> In late March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported to the FCO in London, following </p>
<p>a discussion between his staff and Ambassador Bremer, that:</p>
<p>“Bremer remains committed to de&#8209;Ba’athification but believes that Chalabi has </p>
<p>abused the process by emphasising its retributive elements and ignoring the appeals </p>
<p>procedures … Given the fragile security situation … Bremer is keen to make the </p>
<p>process appear as independent and fair as possible.”</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>135. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Bremer was considering taking responsibility </p>
<p>for de&#8209;Ba’athification away from the GC, and giving it to an independent body. As a </p>
<p>first step, he intended to write to Dr Chalabi, asking for changes to de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>

<p>“Washington have also sought to hobble Bremer’s efforts. Principals prohibited him </p>

<p><b>143. </b> In late April, Sir David Manning reported from Washington that de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>was featuring regularly in US media comment on Iraq:</p>
<p>“Most commentators have portrayed Bremer’s new instructions to the IGC as </p>
<p>a long&#8209;overdue reversal of a fundamental error, and an attempt to clip Ahmed </p>
<p>Chalabi’s wings. Chalabi put a different spin on the decision … arguing that Bremer </p>
<p>had not changed the policy, but had agreed with the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission </p>
<p>on the need to speed up the appeals process.”</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>144. </b> On 20 May, during one of their regular video conferences, Mr Blair proposed </p>
<p>to President Bush that they should look at the approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>suggested that there were probably a few individuals who could play a role in “calming </p>
<p>the Sunnis”. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> Mr Richmond’s assessment, at the end of May, was that “implementation of </p>
<p>Bremer’s initiative to alleviate the consequences of de&#8209;Ba’athification has been slow”.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the appeals process was working, and was having significant results in the </p>
<p>education sector.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> In higher education, there had been 1,681 appeals, of which 750 had been </p>
<p>successful already and the remainder were expected to be granted shortly.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> In the primary and secondary education sector, 12,000 employees had been </p>
<p>removed under the de&#8209;Ba’athification rules, around 9,000 of whom were entitled to </p>
<p>appeal. So far, 4,600 had appealed successfully and a further 1,300 successful appeals </p>
<p>were expected by the end of the month, although there were significant variations </p>
<p>between governorates: “Several southern governorates, including Najaf and Nasiriyah, </p>
<p>have reported that local political and community groups blocked the appeals process.”</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Set against that progress, there were not always jobs available for those who were </p>
<p>reinstated. Within the university sector, a number of posts had been filled and vacancies </p>
<p>no longer existed. Elsewhere, reinstated teachers were “facing competition for jobs from </p>
<p>some 6,000 colleagues who had been removed by Saddam for political reasons and are </p>
<p>now eligible to return to work”.</p>

<p>32</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Richmond observed that Dr Chalabi had “continued to try to interfere” and </p>
<p>that the “patchy follow up” meant that “we are in danger of yet again appearing not to </p>
<p>be delivering on our promises”. He cautioned that it might be necessary to revisit the </p>
<p>original de&#8209;Ba’athification orders: </p>
<p>“… as they give a government broad scope to arrest and detain suspected Ba’athists </p>
<p>for security purposes. Applied punitively, the order could legitimate the type of </p>
<p>mass arrests already proposed by some serving ministers. This would have serious </p>
<p>repercussions, especially among the Sunni community.”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> In a debate in the House of Commons on 7 June, Mr Donald Anderson asked </p>
<p>Mr Straw whether the Government supported a statement by Dr Allawi that “there should </p>
<p>be greater progress towards finding places in the new Iraq for former Ba’athists who are </p>
<p>not guilty of human rights abuses”.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>151. </b> Mr Straw told the House of Commons: </p>
<p>“As for progress on the absorption of former Ba’ath party members who are not </p>

<p>Allawi, and that view is now shared by the United States Government.”</p>
<p><b>The Interim Iraqi Government</b></p>
<p><b>152. </b> On 28 June 2004, the CPA formally handed over to a sovereign Iraqi Government. </p>
<p>In the 11 months that followed, the governance of Iraq was the responsibility of the </p>
<p>Interim Iraqi Government (IIG), headed by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. The process of </p>
<p>establishing the IIG, and its membership, is described in Section 9.3.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> On 30 June, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) assessed that:</p>
<p>“Former Ba’athists are attempting to reorganise both military and political structures. </p>
<p>The attitude of the IIG to former Ba’athists will be key in gaining support in Sunni </p>
<p>Arab areas and discouraging hardliners from attacking the political process or </p>
<p>coalescing with Islamist terrorists. But Allawi’s efforts to draw Ba’athists into </p>
<p>the political process will need to be carefully judged if he is to avoid alienating </p>
<p>the Shia.”</p>

<p>committed. Mr Chris Segar, Head of the British Office Baghdad, reported that:</p>
<p>“… under Iraqi law this was a first step in which the accused is informed that there </p>
<p>are allegations against him which deserve investigation, which allow for continued </p>
<p>detention and that he has a right to legal counsel.”</p>
<p><b>156. </b> On 2 July, the Cabinet Office Assessments Staff told Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s </p>

<p>planning targeted attacks on Iraqi Government ministers.</p>

<p><b>158. </b> On 12 July, Mr Hoshyar Zebari, the new Iraqi Foreign Minister, told a meeting of </p>

<p>“The original policy of de&#8209;Ba’athification has been right but too generalised. He had </p>
<p>ex&#8209;Ba’athists in his ministry though not those who had been involved in intelligence </p>
<p>or atrocities. Ex&#8209;Ba’athist insurgents were now in isolated groups. They did not </p>
<p>represent a coherent force.”</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>159. </b> In one if its regular assessments of security in Iraq, the JIC judged on 21 July that </p>

<p>7 August 2004.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> Mr Asquith reported:</p>
<p>“Amnesty is only provided to Iraqis and only for a limited number of </p>

<p><b>161. </b> A second order was also announced which re&#8209;introduced the death penalty for </p>
<p>around 30 crimes. Most of those crimes related to actions which resulted in the death </p>

<p>“… where there has been an armed uprising against the armed forces; where </p>
<p>an armed uprising aims to invade another country or seize public property; and </p>

<p><b>162. </b> Mr Asquith judged that the order “reflected Allawi’s belief that the insurgents </p>

<p><b>168. </b> On 7 October, the JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“A number of former senior Ba’athists formed the New Regional Command (NRC) in </p>
<p>the early summer, based in Damascus with members in Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and </p>
<p>the Gulf states. The NRC maintains links to a number of insurgent groups and may </p>
<p>provide some strategic military and political direction and funding. But the scope </p>
<p>and scale of its influence is not clear and, whatever its aspirations, the NRC has not </p>

<p>“We plan to work on Iraq’s neighbours to support Allawi’s efforts to detach former </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Prime Minister Allawi’s Legal Adviser told Mr Hood that the new Order had </p>
<p>been drafted on the instructions of Prime Minister Allawi, who judged that returning to </p>
<p>public service might prevent thousands of disaffected former Ba’athists supporting the </p>
<p>insurgency. The philosophy behind the Order was “punish an individual for their crimes </p>
<p>and not their ideology”. It had been approved by the Council of Ministers but not yet by </p>
<p>the President and was unlikely to be signed before the election. </p>
<p><b>175. </b> The draft Order, which Mr Hood was not shown, was said to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disband the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allow all those removed by the CPA to return to their posts, unless that post was </p>
<p>judged to be sensitive or senior (Director General and above) or they were found </p>
<p>to have committed a “crime against the Iraqi people” (undefined); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish a new judicial Commission to investigate allegations of such crimes.</p>
<p><b>176. </b> The report ended:</p>
<p>“Allawi right to see some modification of the de&#8209;Ba’athification process as a </p>
<p>necessary part of promoting national unity, but amending the rules can only be </p>
<p>credibly done by some form of elected government and preferably as part of a wider </p>
<p>initiative on transitional justice.”</p>
<p><b>177. </b> In the form described, the Embassy judged that the Order would “lead to an outcry </p>
<p>from across Iraqi society” with vigilantism expected to follow. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> After visiting Iraq in December 2004, Mr Dominic Asquith, FCO Iraq Director, </p>
<p>commented that in order to achieve political reconstruction and Iraqiisation by early </p>
<p>2006:</p>
<p>“One answer is gradually to incorporate – if necessary into the less sensitive </p>
<p>areas to begin with – experienced Ba’athists (ex or otherwise) prepared to opt into </p>
<p>government and security structures, separating ‘those who served’ from ‘those who </p>
<p>served the previous regime’, while ensuring the appointments survive the transition </p>
<p>to the new government. Established vetting procedures will be key, but the work </p>
<p>done by British experts in CPA days has strangely disappeared from view.”</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>Former Ba’athists and the Sunni insurgency</b></p>
<p><b>179. </b> In January 2005, the Defence Intelligence Staff judged:</p>
<p>“Within the Arab Sunni community there are a number of former senior military </p>
<p>officers and Ba’ath Party officials who remain intrinsically opposed to anything other </p>
<p>than the full restoration of the Ba’ath Party and, in many cases, their own positions </p>
<p>of power. Prominent among this group are the New Regional Command (NRC), but </p>
<p>there are probably further independent actors and organisations not yet identified … </p>

<p>It is important to note that the majority of former regime elements and Ba’athists may </p>
<p>not be ‘restorationists’.”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>180. </b> On 19 January, the JIC assessed that Sunni turnout in elections might be as low as </p>
<p>one&#8209;third of the eligible voters, which would give a disproportionately low representation </p>
<p>to Sunni Arabs in the elected institutions.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> The policy implication of this was, in the </p>
<p>JIC’s view, that “Sunni outreach will need to intensify after the elections to ensure that </p>
<p>Sunnis do not opt out of the political and constitutional drafting process altogether”.</p>
<p><b>181. </b> In early February, the JIC judged that the “hard core and most effective”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sunni </p>
<p>Arab insurgents were former Ba’athists, but the bulk of those involved were simply </p>
<p>disaffected Iraqis “most of whom probably have no long&#8209;term political objectives”.</p>

<p>Reform to work” was a key element of supporting the Iraqi Security Forces to deliver </p>
<p>security.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> The strategy also recommended that the UK should “encourage the ITG [Iraqi </p>
<p>Transitional Government] to relax the rules on de&#8209;Ba’athification as a way of drawing </p>
<p>disaffected former Army officers and officials back into the system”. </p>
<p><b>186. </b> In early March, senior US and UK officials discussed the strategy for Iraq in </p>
<p>2005.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> They identified that, in order to modify the current policy, “one option might be </p>
<p>to shift de&#8209;Ba’athification from a political to a quasi&#8209;judicial process”. Mr Asquith said </p>
<p>that de&#8209;Ba’athification was likely to be on the agenda of the new government at an early </p>
<p>stage and so “we should start engaging the likely key players … at this stage before </p>
<p>their views became settled”. </p>
<p><b>187. </b> A few days later, Mr Charles Heatly (a No.10 Press Officer who had returned from </p>
<p>a secondment in Iraq, where he had been working in Prime Minister Allawi’s office) </p>
<p>advised Mr Blair that one of the key points for UK engagement with the new government </p>
<p>should be: “Minimising the fall&#8209;out from de&#8209;Ba’athification etc. On our side, we should </p>
<p>continue to monitor carefully, and advise caution.”</p>
<p>158</p>
<p><b>188. </b> In late March, Mr Straw also identified the “enormous damage that could be done </p>
<p>to efforts at outreach by a significant renewal of the de&#8209;Ba’athification drive” as one of </p>
<p>the messages being given to the United Iraq Coalition, which had gained the highest </p>
<p>number of seats in January’s election.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The new Government takes office</b></p>
<p><b>189. </b> On 6 May, Mr Chaplin reported to the FCO on prospects for Prime Minister </p>
<p>Ja’afari’s government.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> He identified “how to square the zeal for renewed </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification in the army, police and ministries with maintaining effective forces to </p>
<p>fight the insurgency” as an early challenge. Mr Chaplin reported assurances from Prime </p>
<p>Minster Ja’afari that he would only pursue individuals “who have crimes to answer for”. </p>
<p><b>190. </b> On 5 July, Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair about the Iraqi Constitution.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> He reported </p>
<p>that the timetable remained “tight, but doable”. The UK would need to maintain pressure </p>
<p>on the drafters and senior Iraqi politicians to stick to the principle of consensus and </p>
<p>work towards agreement of a document which reflected the values and aspirations of all </p>

<p>11.1  |  De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Mr Straw enclosed with his letter a paper produced by the FCO Research Analysts </p>
<p>which set out the substantive issues that the Iraqi Constitution needed to address, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>language on how the Constitution could be amended; this was particularly </p>
<p>important given concern among Sunni Arabs that they had not had sufficient </p>
<p>involvement in the development of the Constitution; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification – in the interests of national unity, the UK wanted to ensure </p>
<p>these provisions did not become “more draconian” than the existing provisions </p>
<p>in the Transitional Administrative Law.</p>
<p><b>193. </b> The paper stated:</p>
<p>“Substantive moves towards a ‘truth and reconciliation process’ or further </p>
<p>amendments to the policy of de&#8209;Ba’athification should be dealt with outside the </p>
<p>Constitution.”</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Under the heading “The detail”, FCO Research Analysts explained that the </p>
<p>Transitional Administrative Law said that no candidate for the Transitional National </p>
<p>Assembly should have been a Division member of the Ba’ath Party, unless they had </p>
<p>been given specific exemption to stand. They must not have participated in persecution. </p>
<p>Members of the Presidency Council must also have left the Ba’ath Party at least </p>
<p>10 years before the fall of Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p><b>195. </b> Adherence to these criteria by the main Shia and Kurdish political blocs had meant </p>
<p>rejection of several Sunni Arabs for positions, which has “caused some resentment”. </p>
<p><b>196. </b> On 12 July, Mr William Patey, successor to Mr Chaplin as British Ambassador to </p>
<p>Iraq, reported that Grand Ayatollah al&#8209;Sistani</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> had told the UN Special Representative </p>
<p>to Iraq that “it would be important to maximise Sunni inclusion. The only people who </p>
<p>should be excluded were criminals and former members of the regime.”</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>197. </b> In mid&#8209;July the JIC assessed the state of the insurgency in Iraq, at the request of </p>
<p>the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> It judged that the bulk of Iraqi insurgents were Sunni Arabs but did </p>
<p>not see evidence of a unified or national command structure:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Sunni Arab insurgency remains characterised by disparate groups, some </p>
<p>based on family, tribal and religious links. Many have former regime connections, </p>
<p>and military expertise is widely exploited. But we judge the influence of recalcitrant </p>
<p>Ba’athists, including the Ba’ath Party’s military wing, Jaysh Muhammad, </p>
<p>to be marginal.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>198. </b> In a separate Assessment covering the effectiveness of efforts to engage with </p>
<p>Iraq’s Sunni Arab communities, the JIC judged that “The Iraqi Ba’ath Party, now based </p>
<p>in Damascus, has no obvious support base within Iraq.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>199. </b> The JIC also assessed that “perceptions that ministries are being purged of Sunnis </p>
<p>under the banner of de&#8209;Ba’athification” were “exacerbating tensions”. </p>
<p><b>200. </b> The Iraq Sub&#8209;Committee of the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP(I)) </p>
<p>considered a paper on 18 July entitled “Iraq: Splitting the Jihadists from the National </p>
<p>Opposition”.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> It had been written by the FCO and was presented by Mr Patey. </p>
<p><b>201. </b> The paper described jihadists as “principally foreigners, but an increasing number </p>
<p>of Iraqis”. Its recommendations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to demonstrate inclusivity in the drafting of the Constitution, </p>
<p>committing to the timetable set out in the TAL, and being prepared to intervene </p>
<p>if necessary;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring that the system used in the December elections was province&#8209;based </p>
<p>in order to maximise Sunni Arab participation; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pressing the ITG to relax the de&#8209;Ba’athification rules to allow disaffected former </p>
<p>Army officers and officials back into the ISF and government institutions, and </p>
<p>ensuring that de&#8209;Ba’athification decisions were based in a legal framework </p>
<p>rather than a political one.</p>
<p><b>202. </b> These were to be accompanied by a strong media strategy, aimed at undermining </p>
<p>the jihadists’ “un&#8209;Islamic” message, and active engagement with neighbouring States. </p>
<p><b>203. </b> DOP(I) agreed the broad approach proposed by the FCO.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>De-Ba’athification in the Iraqi Constitution</b></p>
<p><b>204. </b> In an update on the Iraqi Constitution sent to the FCO on 25 July, Mr Patey advised </p>
<p>that the first full draft contained “two unnecessary and unhelpful mentions of Ba’athism: </p>
<p>‘Saddamist Ba’athist’ thinking is prohibited and nominees for the National Assembly </p>
<p>must not have been covered by de&#8209;Ba’athification law.”</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Patey considered that it would be “better and more conducive to national </p>
<p>reconciliation if both references were to be dropped”. </p>
<p><b>206. </b> A note by the IPU on 24 August said that the UK was pushing for an article on </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification to be deleted “in order to increase the chances for Sunni buy&#8209;in”.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>

<p>for the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission to be dissolved”. The IPU observed that this belief </p>
<p>was mistaken, since dissolution of the Commission was a decision for the National </p>
<p>Assembly. </p>
<p><b>207. </b> Mr Patey told the FCO that he had lobbied President Jalal Talabani and </p>
<p>Mr Abdul Aziz al&#8209;Hakim, leader of the UIA/SCIRI, for the removal of reference to the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>208. </b> Mr Patey also suggested to Prime Minister Ja’afari and Mr Masoud Barzani, leader </p>
<p>of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, that “If mention of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission </p>
<p>could not be removed perhaps there could be some reference to indicate that the </p>
<p>process would be a judicial one”.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>209. </b> Secretary Rice told Mr Straw on 24 August that reference to the de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>Commission appeared to have been “dropped”.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>210. </b> On 28 August, Mr Patey reported to the FCO on the substance of the new </p>
<p>Constitution which had been presented to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“The spectre of de&#8209;Ba’athification continues to haunt the text although such </p>
<p>references were heavily diluted in efforts to meet Sunni concerns …”</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Patey observed that the preamble to the Constitution made an important </p>
<p>distinction between “the dictator’s regime and the mainstream Ba’ath Party” and </p>
<p>recognised that Sunnis had suffered with other Iraqis under Saddam. But extremist </p>
<p>groups, which included “Saddamists” were prohibited. </p>
<p><b>212. </b> Sir William Patey told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We spent a lot of time … trying to convince the transitional government and the </p>
<p>Shia politicians that de&#8209;Ba’athification had gone too far, that the de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>commission was being abused. It was being used as a tool to further political ends </p>
<p>rather than save Iraq from a return of the Ba’ath. Now, that is not an argument that </p>
<p>was accepted very readily by Shia, who had a visceral fear of the Ba’athists and </p>
<p>saw Ba’athists in most places. So we had limited success. We were arguing for the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification provisions to be excluded from the Constitution. We managed </p>
<p>to get them watered down, we managed to get them reviewed.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>213. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Rice discussed the Constitution on 29 August.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> Dr Rice </p>
<p>highlighted that the process against Ba’athists set out in the Constitution was “on </p>
<p>an individual basis rather than simply on proof of party membership” and described </p>
<p>that as “a very big concession”. To deal with fears about individuals being victimised, </p>
<p>they discussed a potential international review body which would consider the </p>
<p>decision&#8209;making process, but not re&#8209;hear cases. </p>
<p><b>214. </b> Mr Straw recorded that he had asked for some work to be done on this idea, </p>
<p>and asked Mr Patey to discuss the concept with Ambassador Khalilzad. </p>
<p><b>215. </b> At the end of August, the US Red Team published its “Integrated </p>
<p>Counterinsurgency Strategy for Iraq”.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> It stated that one of the conditions for a </p>
<p>successful counter&#8209;insurgency campaign was to:</p>
<p>“Work with Iraqi leaders in the next government to continue progress in increasing </p>
<p>political accommodation and effective cooperation to solve specific policy </p>
<p>challenges. Place priority on finalizing and implementing agreements to redress key </p>
<p>divisive issues (e.g. de&#8209;Ba’athification, professionalizing ISF institution etc.)”</p>
<p><b>216. </b> UK responses to the Red Team’s report are described in Section 9.3.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> On 12 October, the IPU reported that broad agreement had been reached on </p>
<p>changes to the draft Constitution, including provisions on de&#8209;Ba’athification.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> Those </p>
<p>amendments (to Article 131) were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Membership of the Ba’ath Party alone would not be considered sufficient basis </p>
<p>for prosecution. Members would enjoy equality and protection under the law </p>
<p>unless they were covered by “the provisions of de&#8209;Ba’athification and the orders </p>
<p>issued under it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council of Representatives would form a committee to monitor and review </p>
<p>acts of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission. </p>
<p><b>218. </b> Alongside other measures, the IPU commented that these changes might “help </p>
<p>significantly increase the overall vote in favour of the Constitution”. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> An IPU paper on Sunni outreach dated 27 October referred to the same </p>
<p>amendments as “a step forward” and proposed that the UK should “give our assurance </p>
<p>that we will push hard for implementation of Article 131 in the next Parliament in a way </p>
<p>which allows non&#8209;criminal ex&#8209;Ba’athists into government service”.</p>
<p>178</p>

<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“Tackling de&#8209;Ba’athification is very important, but I’m not sure that just changing </p>
<p>the level of the bar is sufficient: those inside Iraq are more interested in making </p>
<p>a distinction between those who can be prosecuted for criminal acts, not merely </p>

<p>sent a report to Mr Patey of a briefing by the Independent Electoral Commission of </p>
<p>Iraq’s (IECI) International Commissioner, Mr Craig Jenness.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> Mr Wilson wrote that the </p>
<p>IECI had sent the names of around 7,000 electoral candidates to the de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>Commission for checking. Having considered 70 percent of those names, the </p>
<p>Commission had recommended that 67 individuals be disqualified, including some </p>
<p>senior politicians. Mr Wilson proposed that the US and UK should lobby Dr Chalabi.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> A message from the British Embassy Baghdad to the FCO on 29 November stated </p>
<p>that the UK and US had encouraged the IECI “to adopt a process which allows them to </p>
<p>reject the rulings of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission and retain most of the names on </p>
<p>the electoral lists”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> Mr Patey had lobbied senior members of the TNA to allow those </p>
<p>recommended for disqualification to run and commented that “with the US, we will </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinate an approach to seek the Commission to reverse its decisions”. </p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Patey called on Dr Chalabi on 30 November to convey concerns about the </p>

<p>183</p>
<p> He suggested that there </p>

<p> The IPU described the best solution as:</p>

<p> As a result, if the government supported the Commission’s </p>

<p><b>244. </b> At the end of December 2005, the British Embassy Baghdad wrote to the FCO to </p>
<p>describe conversations with Iraqi and US officials about the possibilities for reform of the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>245. </b> The Embassy described the Commission as “an inherently political body”, and said </p>
<p>that there was no real prospect of appeal against its decisions. The new Constitution </p>
<p>offered a potential opportunity to reform the de&#8209;Ba’athification Law, but also the risk </p>
<p>of deepening existing divisions. Article 134(6) obliged the Council of Representatives </p>
<p>to establish a committee to review acts of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission and </p>
<p>government agencies. In the Embassy’s opinion that was “a real opportunity to set in </p>
<p>motion concrete reform of the DBC”. </p>
<p><b>246. </b> Although “the ultimate goal” was repeal of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Law and </p>
<p>dissolution of the Commission, possible steps to address concerns about the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification process included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>imposing procedural checks to “choke the Commission in its own bureaucracy”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removing politically active individuals from the Commission;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pressing for the extradition to Iraq of senior Ba’athists suspected of criminal </p>
<p>activity; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>publication of a final report by the Commission, indicating that its work was </p>
<p>complete. </p>
<p><b>247. </b> Attached to the Embassy’s message was a minute written by the IPU for Mr Patey </p>
<p>earlier in December.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>248. </b> The IPU set out more information about the composition and operation of the DBC. </p>
<p>Its six serving Commissioners were all from the Shia community as two positions allotted </p>
<p>to the Kurdish parties had never been filled. The DBC did not hold formal meetings, and </p>
<p>its only active members were Dr Chalabi, Mr Maliki and Sheikh Jalal al&#8209;Din al&#8209;Sagheer. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> The IPU also described Article 7 of the new Constitution, which banned the </p>
<p>glorification and promotion of the Ba’ath Party in Iraq and its symbols. Although the text </p>
<p>had been “continually watered down”, the final text specified that its provisions would be </p>
<p>regulated by a law. The IPU judged:</p>
<p>“The regulating law will be a yardstick testing attitudes towards de&#8209;Ba’athification – </p>
<p>on the one hand it could be an opportunity to seek concrete reform and repeal of </p>
<p>CPA Order No.1 (the de&#8209;Ba’athification Law). But on the other hand, it could be used </p>
<p>as an opportunity to widen and deepen de&#8209;Ba’athification, or restrict the activities of </p>
<p>political groups which contain former Ba’athists. That said, because it [sic] such a </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>A new government</b></p>
<p><b>250. </b> Evidence seen by the Inquiry confirms that in January and February 2006 the UK </p>
<p>stepped up its efforts to encourage Iraq to form a broad and inclusive government of </p>
<p>national unity through high&#8209;level visits and rounds of phone calls.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>251. </b> Mr Straw visited Basra and Baghdad in early January.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> He met representatives </p>
<p>of political parties from all the main communities, reinforcing the UK’s message on </p>
<p>the need for a unity government. In his view, achieving that mattered more than who </p>
<p>became Prime Minister.</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Some Sunni representatives told Mr Straw that they had been “cheated out of </p>
<p>seats”. He responded that “they must accept the election results once confirmed or they </p>
<p>will be pitting themselves against the whole international community”. </p>
<p><b>253. </b> Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi, a potential candidate for Prime Minister, told </p>
<p>Mr Patey on 1 January that “he would be ready to look at the possibility of appointing </p>
<p>a judge to head the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission” and to reduce the role of politicians </p>
<p>within it.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>254. </b> Prime Minister Ja’afari told Mr Patey on 3 January that, although the Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>and its ideology should remain outlawed, “the half&#8209;million former Ba’ath members </p>
<p>Ja’afari saw as his ‘children’ should not and the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission and its </p>
<p>procedures should be reviewed”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>255. </b> On 3 January, Mr Ayad Allawi told Mr Blair that in forming the new government “the </p>

<p>not”. He was most concerned about Ba’athist military officers. The establishment of a </p>

<p>It concluded:</p>

<p><b>261. </b> On 19 July, the JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“Little has changed in the nature and intensity of the Sunni Arab insurgency since </p>

<p>Maliki’s government includes Sunnis in Ministerial and executive positions, and </p>
<p>some key Sunni demands have been partially met; for example, limited release of </p>
<p>detainees. Maliki has announced a National Reconciliation Plan aimed at addressing </p>
<p>wider Sunni concerns, but there has been no substantive progress as yet. Some </p>

<p><b>269. </b> The new law would mean that only 1,500 of the 10,302 Senior Ba’athists currently </p>
<p>affected would lose their jobs. Of those, only the top tier of party members would be </p>
<p>denied a pension. The cases of those further down the ranks would be reviewed and </p>
<p>those who had not been convicted of a crime would have the option of reinstatement </p>
<p>or retirement with a pension. </p>
<p><b>270. </b> UK officials explained that they would “seek to agree a few components of a ‘fair </p>
<p>law’ with the US and UN and lobby hard for those changes”. They would “focus on </p>
<p>reinforcing the underlying principle that de&#8209;Ba’athification should be an independent </p>
<p>judicial process rather than a political process”. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> UK officials subsequently discussed five changes with US officials, who raised the </p>
<p>first four with Dr Chalabi.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> The proposals, which received a mixed response, were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission should review the cases of all de&#8209;Ba’athified </p>
<p>individuals.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Commission should have a purely investigative role, passing all evidence </p>
<p>to a judge for criminal proceedings where justified. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The new law should not extend the remit of the Commission to civil society, </p>
<p>press and the media.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Commission should produce a report for the Council of Representatives, </p>
<p>which would then consider its dissolution. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The article that prohibited the passing of legislation in breach of the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification Law should be removed. </p>

<p>Mr Blair from Baghdad, where he had just spent three days:</p>
<p>“… the pace of the insurgency hasn’t slackened. The Shia put the blame squarely on </p>
<p>Ba’athists/Saddamists, who they think we under&#8209;estimate. They are convinced that </p>
<p>the former regime’s security and intelligence officials are the driving force behind the </p>
<p>attacks on the coalition, the Shia, and government officials, with the aim of creating </p>
<p>mayhem and an opportunity for them to return to power as the only ones capable of </p>
<p>restoring order. The level of concern has gone up sharply, with reports of Ba’athist </p>
<p>intimidation on the streets of Baghdad … The relative weight of the Ba’athists in the </p>
<p>insurgency isn’t easy to divine, but it is clear that both the Shia and the Kurds still </p>
<p>fear them above all.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>273. </b> On 15 November, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Government’s response to deteriorating security remains ineffective. Many </p>
<p>Shia politicians blame all violence on ‘Ba’athists’. There has been no progress on </p>
<p>national reconciliation …”</p>
<p>217</p>
<p><b>274. </b> The Iraq Forward Plan developed by UK officials in November 2006 (see Section </p>
<p>9.5) said that the UK should encourage Iraqi political leaders to sign up to a Declaration </p>
<p>of Principles/National Compact which included a commitment to prevent the return of a </p>
<p>Ba’athist government “while reviewing de&#8209;Ba’athification to allow all those who have not </p>
<p>committed crimes to participate in building Iraqi stability and prosperity”.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>275. </b> Implementing the Compact would require two new bodies: a Peace Commission </p>
<p>and a Reconciliation/Rehabilitation Commission. The latter, it was proposed, would </p>
<p>not deal with cases before the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission which would continue </p>
<p>to be heard there, but would address detainee issues and hear accounts of pre&#8209; and </p>
<p>post&#8209;2003 violence from victims and perpetrators. </p>
<p><b>De-Ba’athification in 2007</b></p>
<p><b>276. </b> At the end of January 2007, Mr Dominic Asquith, British Ambassador to Iraq, </p>
<p>recorded a report from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Iraqi Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>had split, and a splinter group had formed that wanted to “come back to Iraq, start a </p>
<p>dialogue, renounce violence and act politically”.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> It was hoped that others might be </p>
<p>attracted to the same strategy. </p>

<p> It said that de&#8209;Ba’athification was a “major inhibitor” </p>
<p>of reconciliation and a cause of grievance in the Sunni community. </p>
<p><b>278. </b> The IPU wrote:</p>
<p>“We have worked in close consultation with the US to promote a substantive </p>
<p>discussion between the main political parties on reforming the de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>

<p>and motives for violence. A number of different draft laws have been provided by </p>
<p>different political parties. We are working to help bring these together in a single </p>

<p><b>279. </b> In a separate ‘Update on de&#8209;Ba’athification’, also dated February 2007, the IPU </p>
<p>explained that “we want to see the de&#8209;Ba’athification process reformed and ultimately </p>
<p>brought to an end”.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> In the short term, the objective was to reform the de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>Commission so that it operated in a more independent and transparent way. Specifically, </p>
<p>this meant that it should:</p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>… target an individual’s conduct, not membership of the Ba’ath party, reinforcing </p>
<p>the underlying principle that de&#8209;Ba’athification should be a judicial rather than </p>
<p>political process;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>review the cases of all individuals who have already been de&#8209;Ba’athified, as the </p>
<p>previous process was deeply flawed due to political interference;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>complete the de&#8209;Ba’athification process within a defined period.” </p>
<p><b>280. </b> The IPU explained that the draft US/UK text proposed abolishing the </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission and replacing it with a “Reconciliation and Accountability </p>
<p>Commission” for six months. President Talabani had indicated that he was broadly </p>
<p>content with the US/UK text. If the Presidency Council exercised its right to put the draft </p>
<p>law to the Council of Representatives directly, and other drafts were also presented, they </p>
<p>were likely to be considered by a Committee of the Council. </p>
<p><b>281. </b> On 5 March, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary wrote to the Private Secretary to Mrs </p>

<p>“The Prime Minister would like us to get a UK adviser on reconciliation into Maliki’s </p>
<p>office as quickly as possible … We also need to build influence with Abdul&#8209;Mehdi on </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification … The Prime Minister is pleased at UK/US efforts to ensure that </p>
<p>there is now a single document on de&#8209;Ba’athification with Talabani.”</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>282. </b> In an update for Mr Blair on 23 March, his Private Secretary reported a sense that </p>
<p>Iraqi politicians risked missing the opportunity presented by the Baghdad Security Plan </p>
<p>(see Section 9.5) to pursue reconciliation.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> He wrote that “faltering progress on the oil </p>

<p>224</p>
<p> Mr Asquith wrote that the departure of Ambassador Khalilzad would “deprive </p>
<p>Iraq of one of the great contrivers” and that his final act was:</p>
<p>“… a de&#8209;Ba’athification draft law – a characteristic mix of the bad and the </p>
<p>superficially plausible fix, designed to service immediate domestic US rather than </p>
<p>Iraqi long term interests. My Legal Adviser had been working closely with the </p>
<p>Americans and Iraqis for some months on the substance. I had in parallel been </p>
<p>discussing the provisions with political leaders. The key objectives were to set an </p>
<p>early (eg. six month) date for the termination of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission’s </p>
<p>work, drawing a line definitively in the sand, reduce to as few as possible </p>
<p>(1,200&#8209;1,500) those caught by the provisions and secure the agreement of the </p>
<p>three&#8209;man Presidency Council to a text which could then be introduced directly into </p>
<p>Parliament.</p>
<p>“… Khalilzad persuaded the PM and President (alone) to sign off, thereby failing </p>
<p>the Constitutional condition for fast&#8209;track introduction of legislation. Those caught </p>
<p>by the provisions will increase by 10&#8209;12,000 (and indeed potentially many more, </p>
<p>if Provinces decide to exploit the latitude they are given on implementation).The </p>
<p>termination of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission in a year is undermined by the </p>
<p>creation of a ‘Special Committee’ (of political/security ‘experts’ appointed by the </p>
<p>Presidency and PM) to adjudicate on security clearances for sensitive jobs (in effect </p>
<p>a vetting committee), which has no/no termination date. And the PM is given the </p>
<p>right to intervene in the decisions of the Special Committee and a separate panel of </p>
<p>judges appointed to consider the decisions of the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission or </p>
<p>Special Committee.” </p>
<p><b>284. </b> Mr Asquith recorded that there had as yet been no co&#8209;ordinated response from </p>
<p>Sunni Arab politicians. The only way to introduce the draft legislation into Parliament </p>
<p>rapidly would be to “bend the Constitution”. </p>
<p><b>285. </b> On 12 April, Dr Mowaffak al&#8209;Rubaie, the Iraqi National Security Adviser, told </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the proposed “accountability and justice” law would “allow </p>
<p>90 percent of Ba’athists to return to work”.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> Those who had held high rank would </p>
<p>be excluded from the security ministries, but pension rights for the families of those </p>
<p>who had been prosecuted for their actions would be protected. Dr Rubaie described </p>
<p>implementing the policy as an uphill struggle, but pointed to a “growing consensus in </p>
<p>support of the need to rehabilitate and reconcile”. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> After visiting Baghdad and Basra, Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, wrote </p>

<p>political representation, and release of detainees”. </p>
<p><b>287. </b> On 16 May, the JIC assessed that “genuine fears of a Ba’athist resurgence” were </p>
<p>helping to keep the fragile Shia coalition, the United Iraqi Alliance, together.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p> There had </p>
<p>been “little substantive progress on de&#8209;Ba’athification”.</p>
<p><b>288. </b> The JIC judged that there had been “no tangible progress on national </p>
<p>reconciliation” and that “antipathy” between Shia and Sunni communities remained </p>
<p>“intense”. </p>
<p><b>289. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“… progress on national reconciliation will remain slow unless there is a major shift </p>
<p>in both Shia and Sunni attitudes and expectations, backed by strong and persistent </p>
<p>Coalition pressure. At the moment it means different things to different groups.”</p>
<p><b>290. </b> On 23 May, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary reported:</p>
<p>“… there are now sensible amendments agreed by the Executive Committee to the </p>
<p>existing draft law, which should address some of the key problems for the Sunni, </p>
<p>including a sunset clause for the de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission, a representative </p>
<p>Political Committee to supervise the process (overseen by the CoR [Council of </p>
<p>Representatives]), and introducing a judicial element to the process. Some issues </p>
<p>remain, but this represents welcome progress. Further pressure will have to be </p>

<p>56</p>
<p><b>293. </b> On 1 October, a brief for Mr Brown’s first visit to Iraq as Prime Minister stated:</p>
<p>“Following the Petraeus/Crocker testimonials [see Section 9.6], the centre of </p>
<p>gravity has switched back from Washington to Baghdad, where Maliki is enjoying </p>
<p>a somewhat more secure position. However, he still faces significant challenges: </p>
<p>to break the impasse over key legislation (de&#8209;Ba’athification and Provincial Powers </p>
<p>laws) … and drive forward the reconciliation agenda.”</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>294. </b> The list of points for Mr Brown to make in his meeting with Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>suggested that he should stress the Prime Minister’s particular responsibility to give a </p>
<p>strong lead to national reconciliation. </p>
<p><b>295. </b> In November, the British Embassy Baghdad reported:</p>
<p>“After two months of playing games, the correct draft of the Accountability &amp; Justice </p>
<p>Law (de&#8209;Ba’athification) has now made it to the CoR … there should be sufficient </p>
<p>majority to see this law through.”</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>296. </b> By the end of December, the Accountability and Justice Law still had not been </p>
<p>passed.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>297. </b> The Law was approved by the Council of Representatives on 12 January 2008.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>298. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported on 24 January that, although Vice </p>
<p>President Hashimi had continuing concerns, he had agreed to register them in a letter </p>
<p>to the Speaker rather than delay or veto the law.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>299. </b> On 12 January, the Iraqi Council of Representatives approved the Justice and </p>
<p>Accountability Law (formerly the de&#8209;Ba’athification Law).</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> The Cabinet Office told </p>
<p>Mr Brown that: </p>
<p>“Although the law’s practical impact will be more symbolic than substantive, its </p>
<p>approval nevertheless sends out a positive message especially to Sunnis, about </p>
